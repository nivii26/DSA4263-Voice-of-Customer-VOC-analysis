positive,18/6/21,This is a very healthy dog food. Good for their digestion. Also good for small puppies. My dog eats her required amount at every feeding.
positive,7/7/21,"I've been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food. Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains. Since switching I haven't had any issues. It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger/smaller sized dogs."
positive,18/6/21,"Before I was educated about feline nutrition, I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food. I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters."
positive,7/7/21,"My holistic vet recommended this, along with a few other brands. We tried them all, but my cats prefer this (especially the sardine version). The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear. AND (and I don't want to be rude, so I'll say this as delicately as I can) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores, which is a definite plus for me! The health benefits are so obvious - I highly recommend Holistic Select!"
positive,1/7/21,"I bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the ganocafe and has the organic reishi mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidants.  I didn't expect it to taste good, but it actually does!  I've only had it for a few days and for $5 its totally worth it.  My sisters all take ganocafe but now I'm introducing them to this less expensive similar coffee.  I will follow up on this product in a few weeks.  :)"
positive,7/7/21,"Like the other people mentioned, this coffee has a great taste. I've tried different instant coffees before, but this one is one of the better ones. Another one of my favorites, if you want to try it out (though NOT organic), is 'Africafe pure instant coffee'"
positive,23/7/21,A good tasting light chip that has some value in nutrition.  Everyone get the munchies....is this is a good alternative to eating potato chips!
positive,20/7/21,"A grande item !  Delicious fish with the ultimate flavor, best  ever in a can for all purposes !  I sent a case to my Mother recently diagnosed with Diabetes, and she loves it as a main entree for cooking patties !"
positive,19/7/21,"I ordered this product two times now and have been very happy with both the delivery and the product.  It works great for cooking, baking and as a substitute sugar in my Chai lattes."
positive,18/6/21,"This stuff is great because it's low glycemic. Substitute this to sugar and you'll be doing your body a great favor.  This size is economical and shipping is fast, too.  I got mine very soon."
positive,7/7/21,These chips are the only ones I found to be tasty and healthy. They have fewer fat calories plus higher fiber for those who want good taste and nutrition--the perfect blend!
positive,27/6/21,"I used to buy these at the local supermarket, but they are no longer carried there.  Finding them on Amazon I purchased a box and found they were fresh and delicious as I remembered.  For chips they are also very healthy.  I definately will buy them again."
positive,21/7/21,"I've been feeding liver biscotti for years. I was looking for a healthy treat without additives for my epileptic dog (additives can be a seizure trigger) and liver biscotti filled the bill. The ingredients are top-quality. The bite-size bits are perfect for training and don't muck up your pockets. The bite-size portions also make it possible to give rewards without adding pounds, which is a problem with other treats.  And for dogs with wheat and other sensitivities, there is an anti-allergenic recipe. Enthusiastically recommended!"
positive,18/6/21,"I got these for my gf as she isn't supposed to eat any gluten.  All of the flavors taste great and they seem to be much healthier than regular potato chips.  If you are looking for a gluten-free snack, I highly recommend Popchips!"
positive,7/7/21,"I have a free sampling of these chips and I can see me swapping them for my regular chip cravings. They remind me of Munchos, but are less greasy. Try them."
positive,30/6/21,"I tried this chips in a hotel that I stayed at, and loved them! I ordered them for the office and everyone enjoyed them. I'm on my second order!"
positive,1/7/21,"I absolutely love Pop Chips as a healthy alternative to regular, fatty chips.  The Seat Salt and Pepper and the Sour Cream and Onion are my favorites.  I don't crave regular chips at all!"
positive,24/8/21,"I picked up a few bags of these at my local HEB and couldnt help but consume half of a bag in a day. The entire stock didnt last even a week for me.<br /><br />Many chips say they have a bold flavor but they never deliver. These, however, do. I tried the Garlic Parmessan chips and the first things I thought was how strong and delicious the parmessan was.. shortly followed by a garlic flavor. Combined with a sharp crunch, I cannot have enough of these chips. I'm almost afraid to buy a 24 pack because I know they won't last a month.<br /><br />It also helps that these things are pretty healthy for you. I mean, they are a potato crisp so you can't be entirely guilt-free... but I don't knock myself for going to town. I just avoid the potato chip aisle these are on when I need to lay low on the snack foods ;)"
positive,21/7/21,"I love these chips! They always make a great healthy snack when I'm stuck at work with just the vending machine for sustenance."
positive,25/6/21,"The 'Sun Chips' are an OK substitute for the usual potato, corn, whatever chip cooked in oil and over salted.  They are not nearly as un-palatable as I thought they would be.  Have added them to my 'heart healthy' diet regime.  All are good except for the 'multi-grain' style, which has the texture of a sheet of plywood."
positive,13/9/21,"This chips are really good and it's fun getting the variety pack.  Now, are they as good as ""regular"" chips?  Probably not, but they're also not nearly as fattening and bad for you as regular chips.  Given that these are a healthier version if you want chips, I would highly recommend them!"
positive,18/6/21,"Tried the BBQ Popchips for the first time and loved them so got the value pack to try more flavors. Loved them all except the salt and pepper chips which weren't that great. Good healthy snack without giving up the taste. So glad I discovered these! Salt and vinegar are my favorite! 100 cal/bag, 3.5g fat/bag"
positive,7/7/21,"We'll see how these work out in our family over time. I'm not sure that I am disciplined enough to make good use of them, although it might be a good technique for teaching my dog. They appear to be good for what they are, a very tiny, but healthy, reward. Right now I can visualize them being used as a reward for following commands, a training tool. I was surprised at how tiny these treats were. They seem to taste good enough, but they are miniscule! They are just a fraction longer than a small paperclip and about half as wide, maybe 1/4 as thick.<br /><br />My dog was a little annoyed, but took it when I gave it to him. That was yesterday. Today he came in excited to get his ""treat"", looked at it as if to say, ""You've GOT to be KIDDING!"" Then he took it and ate it. A little later I offered him another one. He put it on the floor and looked hopefully at his stash of larger treats, but when he didn't get one, he went back and took this one.<br /><br />I think these might be good for rewards for obeying commands. Treats? That's stretching it.<br /><br />They may also be good for my son's dog who rarely gets treats because she's overweight and would eat the whole entire refrigerator full of food if allowed. At least she would get a treat. Large treats take her 5 seconds. She'll probably inhale these, one second max.<br /><br />I like the fact that these are low-fat, with no added salt, no refined sugar, no artificial flavors, colors or preservatives. It says, ""Treats Baked With Natural Peanut Butter."""
positive,15/7/21,"I am a mom of 3 kids. With my older two I had such a hard time finding a snack for them that didn't have so much sodium! When my 3rd came along, HappyFamily introduced HappyMunchies. I was so thankful to find a snack low in sodium and with a vegetable too! And to top it off, it is organic so I know it is free of pesticide residue and GMOs!"
positive,11/7/21,"We love these baby food things in a little pouch. Sooooo much easier to feed to a baby or toddler on the go. Our son loves sucking the fruit out and we are pleased that it is both organic and healthy with nothing added - just fruit. For smaller ones, not good to let them handle it themselves, because they love to squeeze it, which gets things everywhere. But older ones can feed to themselves. I like the 3.17 size rather than the bigger one that Plum Organics has for some of the other flavors. It assures that he will eat all or most of it in one sitting rather than having to save some for later. You can also take this size on airplanes without having to have it tested for explosives - not the case with the bigger pouches. I also like that it is BPA free. If your little one likes them, ordering in bulk and with subscribe and save makes them much cheaper than at the store."
positive,7/10/21,"I love VitaMuffins, but my supermarket sells one box of 4 muffins for $6.29.  Instead I bought the mix, 3 boxes for $16.00, and each box makes 12 muffins. Instead of $1.62 per muffin, the mix only requires water & eggs and works out to about 48 cents per muffin, and very easy to make. That's a great deal."
positive,6/7/21,"I generally like vitalicious products. The corn muffin, well, for 100 calories it's not bad. But if you are expecting anything like the sugar/fat laden junk that your local bakery sells, look elsewhere. this is like a healthy makeover that doesn't quite cut it, but they're not bad. For the same amount of calories, the chocolate one is more of an indulgence, but this one is good for a bland breakfast treat, especially baked fresh.<br />My kids are happy to get any extra snacks, so they approve...i send with them to school for a midmorning snack. im glad they get fuel and vitamins."
positive,18/6/21,"My dog had been prone to ear infections and did a lot of paw chewing when his vet recommended changing his diet because his symptoms may be due to a food allergy. She specifically recommended the salmon and rice formula. Unfortunately, my dog hated the salmon and rice and it smelt extremely fishy. I tried the lamb and rice formula and he likes it much better. I've heard numerous good things about Wellness from my dog trainer, as well as other pet owners and pet store employees. My dog is adjusting to the new food well. However, I can tell he doesn't consider it the most tasty of choices- probably because it doesn't have the artificial flavoring in it. But I'd rather him eat something much healthier even if we have to sacrifice a little on the taste."
positive,7/7/21,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:00 Mins<br /><br /></span>These cookies are so great! Watch our video to see how great they really are!!!"
positive,27/7/21,"Actually, Sojo's strongly recommends that the meat you add to their mixes be raw, but it an be cooked as I choose to do.  My dog arrived with coccidia and giardia as a puppy.  Through veterinary mismanagement, he was never completely healthy for the first 2 1/2 years of his life.  After watching him get sicker on an aggressive course of antibiotics and prednisone for his Inflammatory Bowel Disease, I took him to a holistic veterinarian.  Part of his treatment has been a homemade diet of Sojo's and meat plus no medications.  I'm extremely pleased to report he has had no GI episodes in over 6 months and has reached a point where I consider him healthy.  His coat is glossy and much fluffier than before he's finally at a good weight.  I have before and after photos that show a dramatic improvement,much of which I credit to Sojo's.<br /><br />It does take some extra time to prepare as opposed to kibble, but I make 4 days worth at a time. This takes me about 30 - 40 minutes total which includes down time while the meat is cooking and cleaning up after.  To be completely honest, I'm not thrilled about cooking for my dog but I am thrilled with the results.  If I was able to feed him raw (perhaps down the road, when our vet gives the ok), preparation time would  be almost nothing."
positive,13/7/21,"It's also a routine baking ingredient. I put it into my bread along with sunflower seeds and organic wheat flour. I also put it into my smoothie, stir fry dishes....anything you can think of! Good price and really, it's a must have for a healthy diet!"
positive,13/9/21,"I have tryed the Almond Crunch and is delicious and healthy snack better than chips Try it you'll agree"
positive,7/9/21,I use the powdered tea powder in my fruit smoothies.  Provides you all the health benefits of green tea.  Love the product and use both the plain and lemon ginger.
positive,17/4/21,"Green tea is good for you, loaded with antioxidants, boosts your metabolism, yadda, yadda, yadda, but I never quite warmed up to the taste.  Until now.  The lemon and the ginger give this a very nice flavor.  And it is SO great that I can just add a packet to my water bottle and go, without the bother of brewing it."
positive,10/3/21,"I eat a lot of cereal, and that includes a lot of the high-fiber kinds. Oatmeal, Mini (Frosted) Shredded Wheat and Raisin Bran are usually what I'd eat when I needed to lose a few lbs., but there have been a few instances where I tried the ""healthier"" options. I've tried several of the Kashi cereals, but they weren't very appetizing. The plain one had a cardboard taste. Next, I tried Grape Nuts, which is like a horrendous yeast flavored cat food (though it's closer to kitty litter in texture.) That brings me to FiberPlus Antioxidants.<br /><br />This Berry Yogurt Crunch is certainly one of the better tasting high-fiber cereals I've eaten. It's like a decent health bar broken apart into cereal. The clusters of yogurt really help, but even the plain cereal is decent enough on its own. Yes, there are 12g of Sugar per serving, but the 10g of Fiber and 170 Calorie parts more than make up for it. Especially if you compare it to Raisin Bran and Frosted Shredded Wheat, which are typically higher in Sugar and Calories, yet lower in dietary fiber. The antioxidants are a nice bonus, too.<br /><br />The bottom line is that I'll add this to my grocery list whenever it's on sale or the price is right."
positive,17/4/21,"I don't know why Science Diet is being referred to as junk food, as it is one of the higher quality foods on the market. A lot of the new organic and natural cat foods are not as healthy for pets as they are cracked up to be. But regardless, my veterinarian wanted me to put my 2 year old cat on a prescription food because of the high count of crystals in her urine. After some comparisons, Science Diet Mature Adult active longevity is the closest to the prescription food. Both my cats, the younger one and the older (10) are on this food and they seem to enjoy it. They both graze all day and are indoor cats so i try my best not to overfeed them. My younger cat has not had issues with her urine since she went on this food and we are all happy :)"
positive,21/1/21,"These chocolate sandwich creme cookies by WhoNu? are every bit as delicious as similar brands but they are healthier for you. True, they have almost the same sugar, fat and carb amounts of the best-known name brand of these cookies; but as others have noted they also give you fiber with noticeably more vitamins and minerals than that other brand. This is a plus!<br /><br />They're really good as a snack and it's hard to stop at the serving size of just three cookies; but I guess I'm allowed an occasional guilty pleasure! As I write this they are a bit too expensive on this website; try looking for these cookies elsewhere unless you want the convenience of having them shipped to your door.<br /><br />Overall, these awesome chocolate sandwich creme cookies by WhoNu? are the best! I definitely recommend them as an excellent, healthier alternative to the major name brand of this type of cookie.<br /><br />I love `em! Enjoy!"
positive,30/1/21,We like this brownie mix and I usually use the low fat recipe on it. I also add chocolate chips or something else to it otherwise it ends up a little bit dry.<br /><br />We still buy this by the case.
positive,13/2/21,"These brownies are good, but the flax seed texture can be a real turn-off.  To minimize it, I added a little whole wheat flour, splenda and cocoa - BIG improvement and my guests never complained (like they did the first time I made the brownies!)."
positive,15/1/21,"We just got our first order a few days ago, and my 10 month old daughter loves them! They're just like the Gerber mini veggies, but much cheaper. Although they still cost a good bit, having a nutrient filled, easy to take anywhere travel snack is well worth it. My daughter doesn't have any teeth yet, and she hasn't had any problems eating them. They're light and fluffy, yet full of flavor."
positive,6/3/21,"I am not sure why the 2 speciality stores in my area stopped carrying these as they were usually sold out. The cakes are 18 calories, crunchy and good--not like the cardboard taste of thicker rice cakes. Excellent as a base for PB&J, or to make an open face sandwich, or to use in pieces like a chip for dips, etc. Good price on the 12 pack with a 10 month expiration use date."
positive,8/6/21,I purchased these based on others recommendations. The rice cakes are delicious. Thinner than the usual rice cakes in the supermarkets. Dense...not full of air. I covered them with PB2 (those watching their weight can eat peanut butter for 45 calories a serving vs 190 for regular PB and it tastes exactly the same). I too highly recommend these rice cakes.
positive,7/1/21,"Over 90% of dry dog food is very unhealthy and can not even get 1 or 2 stars out of 5 or 6. Diamond Naturals is a great food. I have 6 Afghans and I've spent many, many hours of research to find this out."
positive,17/4/21,This is a very good snack that I feel great about offering my 10 month old.  She can easily  pick up the small pieces and definitely enjoys the apple cinnamon taste.  My 5 year old loves them as well!  I would definitely recommend these to anyone with small (or larger) kids.  :)
negative,10/3/21,"SOMETHING TO EAT IF YOU'RE STARVING - BUT PLEASE GIVE REAL FOOD TO HUNGRY PEOPLE,<br /><br />What's in Kellogg's Corn Flakes? ""Milled Corn, Sugar, Malt Flavoring, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Salt."" Yes, of course, it also has lots of yummy preservatives such as BHT and a few synthetic vitamins and iron in minute quantities. For nutrition you get basically 100% Carbs from lots of SUGAR and almost NO PROTEIN. Add skim milk, or you'll get saturated fat with a little protein from whole milk. For added nutrition, include a sliced banana and a capful of wheat germ.<br /><br />If you like Corn Flakes, that is your business and you should enjoy them, but this is not health food and it is a very poor value for more than 0.29 cents an ounce [$3.49 per package]. At this price, the inner package's failure to maintain freshness is an even bigger drawback when one thinks of how long it may take to finish 12 ounces of this stuff. Why not use a vacuum-sealed container like Kretschmer's Wheat Germ to preserve freshness? After all, it's in the same price range!<br /><br />So if you are hungry, you are really eating the wrong stuff. SOMETHING TO EAT IF YOU ARE STARVING - BUT PLEASE GIVE REAL FOOD TO OTHER HUNGRY PEOPLE PLEASE!"
positive,14/1/21,"Sardines are a useful item to stock for times when you want to add a bit of protein to your meal without breaking the bank. I like that they are lower in mercury than big fish are, and high in omega fats. The skinless ones are much better tasting in my opinion--regular sardines taste a bit too oily, fishy, and strong to me. They are fairly neutral with the absence of added oil or much salt and this makes them versatile--I sometimes add lemon and mayonnaise for a sandwich filling, mix with egg, oatmeal, onion and lemon and fry for a fish patty, or add them to a salad. Although I think these from Roland are very good, I liked the Seasons skinless sardines, which are also sold by Amazon, even better for flavor and texture."
positive,24/5/21,"Stores are not carrying this product - thank goodness I can still get them!!!!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CMHMUC"">Genisoy Soy Crisps, Deep Sea Salted, 3.85-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>"
positive,14/10/21,"I was really surprised when I tried this product because I found it to be a really light & fluffy batter. So don't think gluten free means flavorless, this Bisquick Pancake Mix will have you building up stacks of fluffy pancakes for your family. It's so nice that these are healthier for you, diabetic friendly and still manage to taste great too!"
positive,7/2/21,I HAVE A 7 YEAR OLD SCOTTISH TERRIER WHO HAS SOME FOOD ALLERGIES. NO WHEAT FOR MY GIRL. :) THIS TREAT IS GREAT FOR SETTLEING AN UPSET STOMACH AND MY DOG LOOKS FORWARD TO HER CHARCOAL BONE TREATS.
positive,29/3/21,"I highly recommend these very tasty Kavli Thin Crispbreads. I wanted something different than just white bread for sandwiches. I hate whole wheat. I love rye. I saw these, noticed the ingredients couldn't get much simpler and gave them a try. Topped with cheese, or a sandwich spread or whatever you'd like they're very tasty. I feel as full after 2 or 3 of these, topped of course, as I did with just white bread. They're nice and thin so it isn't like biting into anything hard - just a nice crunch. The flavor isn't strong at all - it is very mild and nothing like a rye bread you might have purchased in the past. Then I noticed that they are only 20 calories per slice. What's not to love? They taste good, they're whole grain, they're super low in calories, it's no crunchier than a potato chip, and I feel satisfied while chewing and after eating them. Oh - and they keep forever in the cupboard. I definitely will be buying these for a long time. :)"
positive,17/4/21,"I'm very pleased with this dog food.  Haven't ordered anything else for my dogs since I bought this.  My lab and my malti poo both eat it happily and I'm happy that it is healthy for them."
positive,10/3/21,"I have started buying a lot of organic food over the past year, and it dawned on me that perhaps my dog should be eating more healthfully also. When I look at the list of ingredients on regular dog food, it is downright nauseating! I bought some of this Newman's Own and my dog loves it. She usually gobbles it up the minute I put it into the bowl."
positive,10/7/21,"I signed up for the monthly subscription for this item. The price is great especially without having to pay shipping charges. I love the fact that I can manage the subscription by skipping a month or ordering it earlier than scheduled. Amazon has been excellent getting my shipments out on a timely manner. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK33C6"">Newman's Own¬Æ Organics Adult Dog Food Chicken & Rice Formula, 7-Pound Bag</a>Very pleased with all my orders from Amazon. Extremely pleased with their customer service! THANKS AMAZON!"
positive,27/1/21,"I feel better about feeding this product to my dogs.  I was using another popular brand,<br />but it contained a lot of fillers.  One of my dogs is ""pickier,"" so he would prefer a meatier<br />taste, but he does clean it up eventually."
positive,1/6/21,"Our family loves these tasty and healthy sesame honey almonds by Trader Joe's.  You get the crunchy flavor of the sesame seeds combined with the subtle sweetness of the honey and almond flavoring.  Wow--it's a great snack that you feel good while eating.  It is my favorite of Trader Joe's almond snacks.  Almonds are good for you and a handful of these in the morning with a fruit smoothie or as a snack at lunch is a great way to get protein, the healthy fat and the Vitamin E that almonds offer. It's a good idea to measure out 1/4-1/2 cup of these almonds or count the almonds out to stay in the calorie range you want to keep within. Nutritionist recommend having a small amount of almonds or walnuts each day for good fat and protein."
positive,20/8/21,"I love these cookies. I am on the paleo diet right now and these cookies are what I look forward too. I do like the taste of the tropical one the best. They all have different taste but if you want something that is grain free and gluten free then this is the right place. I expected the taste to be different and it is. Other reviewers seem to expect them to taste like oreos or chips ahoy. Of course not.<br /><br />When I eat them, I don't even feel bad about it because my body welcomes them. They don't make me crash either and feel like I ate junk food. It is a good indicator that these were made from all natural ingredients. I wish I had these cookies close to me. I'd buy them every single day!"
positive,14/8/21,"The flavor of the fruit enclosed is outstanding(bluberry) and if there is  a drawback it is that the blanket that encloses the fruit is a bit thick (unlike this companys fig bars) and pastry textured.Flavored with cane  syrup(not fruit juice).150 cal per bar,and low in fat and the carbs(29) not too bad considering the great taste."
positive,21/4/21,"Of the Erin Baker products, the Fruit & Nut Mini Breakfast Cookie is my favorite!  I have one mini breakfast cookie (about 100 calories) with a cup of coffee in the morning and I feel satisfied and ready to start the day.  Very healthy, low in caloreis, and super delicious is what makes the product work for me.  Try it, you'll like it."
positive,1/4/21,"I adopted my adorable Edmund last year from a shelter. They sent me home with a small bag of Felidae (NOT grain free version) cat and kitten dry formula as he was a kitten at the time.<br />I am very concerned about eating healthy WHOLE foods, so I of course want the best for my kitty as well. I did research and found that cats' digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains/fruits/vegetables directly, and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey's stomachs (ie: if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it). So I wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what's found in nature as possible, without breaking the bank.<br />He already seemed to really like the Felidae Grain-included version, so as soon as my starter bag ran out I immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has ONLY eaten this ever since I got him - he LOVES it!<br />I give him one small scoop of grain free kibble in the morning and then a partial can of this large 13oz Felidae grain free food (we've tried both the turkey/chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and Edmund prefers the turkey/chicken but will eat anything I give him :-)). I bought some can lids at Petsmart, and they seal air tight on these cans - so fridge storage is clean and easy.<br /><br />He has the absolute SOFTEST, SHINIEST FUR COAT I have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy - we haven't had a single vet visit since I adopted him (even though he had chronic upper respiratory issues when I got him, they all cleared up). I have to blame at least SOME of all this on the fact he only eats grain free Felidae food (the rest is because I love him so ridiculously much!).<br /><br />I LOVE the FREE SHIPPING on Amazon (I buy a case of canned and a bag of dry (or two of one) at the same time)! I used to buy this elsewhere, and since it's so heavy shipping would often be almost as much as the product!"
positive,17/4/21,"These are very healthy 7 grains and very light and crispy, perfect with dips or salsa.  Tastes just like rice cake.  They are very easy on the teeth too, for those who have dental work that they don't want to chip. Hard to find in supermarkets."
positive,10/3/21,"This product is delicious.  I will say this upfront - Thou semi messy (why not place the peanut butter in the center??? Instead on the back?)  The taste is great.  So great that I started to eat them all day -- not good as it ruins the enjoyment!!!<br /><br />These are actually so good I had to stop eating them!!! (I guess I over did it!!!)<br /><br />Value:  Excellent snack for everyone (all my friends love them) / family.<br /><br />Shipping:  Fast (as always with Amazon Prime membership - 2 days)<br /><br />Packaging:  6 Boxes Total - each contains 6 individually wrapped granola ""thins""  (1/3 of granola bar but flat with peanut butter on one side [seriously).<br /><br />Also do not ruin the granola as I did by eating every day!!! Also I notice to avoid mess just open with scissors!!! (pealing makes a mess!!!)<br /><br />[...]  Exclusively"
positive,22/4/21,"If anyone is looking for delicious and healthy snack, Doctor Kracker is an answer.  However, the hard crispiness is for people with good teeth."
negative,25/4/21,"I ordered a flat of food (they were on sale) that contained Chicken Apple Compote Dinner. It contained 3 of this variety and he liked the first one but the others, although properly sealed, were solid and moldy and stinky.<br />One of the Turkey dinners in the flat was also improperly sealed; the lid popped. We were lucky because I just happened to check that one. Now I'm so paranoid that I check all of them several times. I called Earth's Best and they assured me that they haven't had this problem before and that I shouldn't worry about it. I'm so suprised that this got passed QA/QC inspection at a baby food manufacturer. Why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety?!<br /><br />We also recently opened 5 other jars in this flat after my son refused to eat them and realized that they were rotten.  3 of them were completely solid and domed at the top!  We poked a toothpick down to the bottom of the jar and it was dry throughout.  Shortly after eating his last dinner of this box, my son started vomiting and refused to eat.  We have contacted the USDA about this.  If this happens to you, please same your jars so you can give them the information they need.  It may prevent other babies from getting sick.<br />I'll never buy anything from Earth's Best again!"
positive,1/4/21,"Arrowhead Mills Organic Savory Herb stuffing has a very nice blend of herbs for a flavor that compliments chicken and turkey. I especially appreciate the fact that there are no transfats used in this stuffing so I and my family can enjoy it without worry! The stuffing is very easy to prepare, but really adds to the meal. We use it all year long. Why wait for a holiday to enjoy good food?"
positive,30/6/21,"Soon after one dog was diagnosed with renal failure (Yes, she ate all the foods on that recall list), my Westie became ill and couldn't hold any food. The vet did all sorts of tests, but I had to find something gentle enough for him to keep down. That night I met a rep from Nutro at my local Petco. She told me all about Natural Choice, gave me literature and a website to learn more. I purchased this canned food along with a small bag of the dry food to mix with it. Turns out the dog had some sort of virus, but the food was the only food he could keep down to regain his strength. Due to skin allergies known to Westies, I have kept him on this food and find it's the best for him.<br /><br />I just don't understand, though, how this is sold so cheap on Amazon thru Petco. It's $16.99/case in the store and $15.99 on their website.  I think they should keep the price regulated throughout."
positive,1/3/21,"My dog has many food allergies, but these made-in-the-USA treats are free of wheat, corn, egg, and dairy.  My dog can't get enough of them."
positive,29/1/21,"4 Stars is a compromise between my rating of 2 and my grandchildren's rating of 5 stars.  I thought the flavor was too heavy on the apple/grape juice combo and light on the orange/tangerine flavor.  Also, it left a mild, canned aftertaste.  But my 9-year-old granddaughters loved it and consider it a treat equal to soda.  It is 100% juice concentrate which has been reconstituted with carbonated water, so it is much healthier for them than regular soda.  While it is true it still has sugar, natural sugars from the juices are healthier than processed sugars found in soft drinks. The can I was sent contained 8.3 ounces which is a better size for them than a regular 12 ounce can of soda.  For children, this is a tasty and healthy alternative."
positive,17/4/21,"I am a die hard soda pop fan. I will drink juice but normally only certain brands or with a little soda (7up or Sprite) mixed in to kill the after-taste and to sweeten it up a bit.<br /><br />Well this is better that even that mix without the bad stuff from the soda. It has a crisp, clean orange taste with a nice tangerine undertone that continues through the after-taste. It is effortless to drink and doesn't make you feel sluggish afterwords. It is hard to describe other than to say they got it right. No extra sugar, yet it is very sweet, but not too sweet.<br /><br />I shared my can with my wife and she agreed with my comments 100%. We both we were sad that we only got the one little can to review and not the entire case!<br /><br />While I am not sure it could replace my Coke, it sure could replace my juice and some of my coke intake. The only problem (there always seems to be something) is that it is about 4 times the cost of my coke per oz. I could justify twice the cost but four times is the only reason I haven't ordered more so far. I do expect to breakdown and buy a case, but I still won't be happy over the cost difference."
positive,10/3/21,"I love everything about this drink.  It's got plenty of carbonation.  Even without added sugar or artificial sweeteners, it's plenty sweet, without being too sweet.  I LOVE tangerine, and this has a very tangerine-y flavor and aroma.  If you love oranges or tangerines, this is the perfect drink for you.<br /><br />I ordered this from the Vine program out of curiosity, but it will be one of my ""must buy"" items in the future.  I'm also going to buy some for my grandchildren.  Since it has no added sugars, and I know they'll love it, it will be perfect for them."
positive,30/5/21,"I quit sodas over a year ago due to the unhealthiness of them.  I do, however, like bubbly drinks, but I don't need the sugar or sodium.  That's why this product is perfect.  It is 100% fruit juice, carbonated for the bubbliness.<br /><br />Orange is one of my favorite flavors.  This drink is the perfect drink.<br /><br />I think this product is even better than orange soda; orange soda is sticky, but this product is not.  It has the perfect amount of sharpness - which I love.  Because it is 100% fruit juice, it also has the perfect amount of natural sweetness.<br /><br />So this product is all the good things rolled into one:<br /><br />100% fruit juice<br />No added sugar<br />Bubbly<br />Awesome orange flavor<br /><br />It's so good, it's hard to believe you're drinking something healthy."
negative,28/9/21,"Unlike another product I reviewed for Vine, at least this product does not have sugar per se in it. It is carbonated water added to a concentrate mixture of (in this order): apple, grape, tangerine and last - as well as least -- acai concentrate. The first two on the list, apple and grape are two of the most common ""fruit"" sweeteners used in beverages etc. That is why the product tastes sweetened.<br /><br />It has 140 calories -- quite a lot for 8 oz of flavored carbonated water -- and all of it is from carbohydrates (36 grams) and over 90% of the carbs (34 grams) are sugars. Apple and grapes have some of the highest concentrations of ""fructose"" a fruit sugar that not only commonly appears in commercial beverages because it is sweeter than regular cane sugar and thus it is cheaper to use, but it is also known to cause diarrhea, particularly in children.<br /><br />So another drink on the hit parade of ""pretend"" healthy drinks- appealing to the masses' concern for their ever-growing girth -- and deluding them that this will help forestall continued growth.<br /><br />You are better off drinking diet coke. You would be even more better off buying the sparkling flavored waters with no calories. My favorite is Bella Familglia -- in pomegranate, lime, lemon and orange flavors -- and is sold from time to time on Amazon as well as your local supermarket.<br /><br />Better yet, buy some organic pure fruit juice -- such as pomegranate and pour  1/8 cup in a glass of your favorite sparking water or a quarter cup in a 16 oz bottle of your favorite sparkling water. At least it is the actual juice and not some fructose extract."
positive,6/5/21,"I was really surprised at the taste of the Switch Orange Tangerine drink. It reminds me of carbonated orange juice. It is a little on the sweet side but not too bad in my opinion. This is actually a beverage that I could drink all the time and not get tired of.<br /><br />The BEST thing about Switch is that it is HEALTHY for you and it doesn't have any added sugars and it has a lot of Vitamin C. Switch is a all natural beverage which is great. You can have the carbonation of a soda without all the unhealthy unnatural ingredients of a soda.<br /><br />If you want a great tasting drink that is healthy for you then I highly recommend Switch. If you like orange juice then I think you'll really enjoy this. The cans are a little on the smaller side though."
positive,20/4/21,"My teens and their friends drink regular soda pop by the gallon!  They're obviously addicted to the stuff - a very unhealthy habit.<br /><br />I can't drink soda pop myself, it's been 5 years or so since I had one, and so I began searching for a drink that tasted like regular soda pop, but wasn't unhealthy.  I searched high and low for a suitable alternative - and then I found  Izze.<br /><br />I love the fruity, tangy flavor of Izze's sparkling grafefruit soda.  The grapefruit flavor goes well with spicy mexican foods, but it is also great just by itself.<br /><br />My teens love Izze and drink it now just like soda pop!  I'm so happy to know they aren't guzzling down corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors, but instead are enjoying all-natural Izze, with no added sweeetners!<br /><br />If you're looking for a great alternative to regular soda pop - you can't do better than to buy Izze."
positive,20/4/21,"Sticks and Twigs may seem a little pricey compared to regular pretzels, but the bag lasts a long time and the ingredients, like flax seeds, quinoa, chia seeds and curry, are good for you. They are very crunchy, but tasty. For some added protein, I like to dip them in peanut butter."
positive,21/4/21,"Usually, healthy food is hard to swallow. Not these, fresh, crunchy, delicious pumpkin seeds. I switched from potato chips and my wife tells me they are good for the prostate. What do I know? I'm taking her word for it."
positive,2/5/21,"I had never tried Bob's Red Mill pumpkin seeds although I have used and been very happy with many of their other products. I was looking for pumpkin seeds from pumpkins grown in the USA. Most of the organic seeds are from China. The Bob's Red Mill seeds are from pumpkins grown in Oregon.<br /><br />I took the plunge and ordered 4 bags of these seeds, and they arrived in less than 48 hours.<br />Four sealed bags were also in a sealed Bob's Red Mill box and then packaged in a larger amazon box.<br /><br />I just opened one bag of the seeds to try them. They are WAY better than what I was getting at my local whole food store in bulk. These seeds are chewy as they should be and not hard or stale with any off-taste.<br />These have a slight pumpkin taste, which they should have. This variety of seed is rounder and flatter than some of the other pumpkin seed varieties I've had, which I like (no pointy ends to stab me as I'm munching them down).<br />All in all, a great buy!<br /><br />Seeds = 5 stars<br />Grown in the USA = 5 stars<br />Total = 10 stars!"

positive,7/9/21,"I was very satisfied with my purchase of Nutiva hemp seeds. I ordered a 2-pack of them and it arrived fairly quickly. They taste great on their own, but I usually add them to protein shakes to enhance the amino acid profile, or sprinkle them on top of salads for added flavor and texture. My supply is almost gone so I'll definitely be ordering more.<br /><br />One of the reviews said there were still shells in the bag but I didn't find any in mine."
positive,25/5/21,I used the hemp seeds every morning with my protein shake. The taste is great and they are so healthy!!!
positive,22/5/21,"When I was told by my nutritionist that eating a handful of whole, natural almonds a day would help me to lose weight and get the right kind of fats and proteins implemented into my diet, I was a bit skeptical.  I was not a huge almond fan to begin with.  I don't particularly enjoy salted or roasted almonds.  Usually only the kind that come surrounded with coconut and chocolate or the kind that you get out of the nut bowl to shell around the holidays.  The Whole Natural almonds by Blue Diamond taste like they came right out of the shell and boy are they yummy.<br /><br />I like that they are a satisfying snack and I like the taste of them.  These are the ones I buy ... no added salt or anything.  Nice and fresh right out of the shell.<br /><br />5 stars."
positive,19/7/21,"If you want a truly healthy, filling snack, you must give these a try, as well as their sisters, the Vanilla Bean Almonds. They are both just lightly sweetened, and fragrant with either the cinnamon or the vanilla, depending on which you choose. The container is marvelous; there is a half flip top which is easy to do with one hand (like in the car). And they're not roasted in more oil, so the almonds are ""meaty"" and sweet. And almonds are SOOO good for you. I'd recommend that you try them, and then get an Amazon subscribe and save if you can. It's well worth it! And all natural. LOVELY!"
positive,7/9/21,"I wouldn't call these almonds sweet, but they do have just the right hint of sweet flavor that the almond is elevated and feels like a treat.  The taste and texture of almonds doesn't particularly appeal to me, but they're such a healthy snack that I'm glad to find this delicious option.  Also, the small container is the perfect size to have on your desk or keep in the car, or use as stocking stuffers like I plan to do for a couple of my healthy eating conscious friends!"
positive,25/8/21,"The almonds tastes all right. Since it is too dry, the salt can hardly stay on surface. Therefore, it is not salty enough. On the whole, it is a healthy snack. I hope this type of almonds can have subscription service and discount."
positive,6/9/21,"These almonds taste good, not as well flavored as the cinnamon or vanilla flavored but a decent change of pace.  A little plain though."
positive,25/5/21,"My review is for the Cinnamon cookie in the small bag.  I love them!!!  I do not have gluten issues, but I like the fact that the cookies are gluten free.  They are crunchy and satisfy my desire for something sweet.  Only 130 caloriesand 4.5 g of fat in three cookies.  Each pack has 4 cookies.  1.5 g of saturated fat, 0 trans fat, 0 cholesterol, 180 mg sodium, 1 g fiber, 21 g of carbs, and 2 g of protein.  Yummy, every bite.  Starbucks carries them sporadically, and I am so glad to be able to buy them from  Amazon!"
positive,7/9/21,"I love almonds in general, and this particular brand is quite good.  They taste great, with just the right amount of salt and oil (for me, anyway).<br /><br />They're individually packaged in 6 oz. cans, which makes them an easy and portable snack.  Portion control is also easier with the small can size.<br /><br />I've ordered a few packs of these almonds, and while there is some slight variation in the taste from batch to batch (some are roasted a bit darker than others), I have always found them fresh and tasty.<br /><br />Almonds are relatively healthy too - high in protein, a good source of magnesium, calcium, and manganese, and full of unsaturated fats.<br /><br />I haven't seen organic roasted, salted almonds from this company, but I hope they offer them eventually at a decent price.  One thing I would also like to see is some kind of assurance that the can liner is free of BPA."
positive,13/10/21,"I was a skeptic about this product until I tried it with skim milk. This cereal is delicious and retains its crunch even after 5 minutes of being soaked in milk. I enjoy its texture and caramelly flavor. I think it could definitely be less sweet and lower carb, but so far, I find this cereal to have the highest fiber content. The other vitamins and minerals a single serving contains is also comparable to similar products by other companies. This is perfect for breakfast or a snack any time of the day!"
positive,2/10/21,"We were pleased with this salt. It's actually more salty than regular salt, even kosher salt or sea salt.  A little bit goes a long way!  I don't usually cook with it, but add it to things afterwards. I've been hand grinding it."
positive,23/9/21,"Right now I own 3 cats that I found outside, a good eight years ago, and I found another cat which I adopted also.  I have always fed them Eukanuba Adult Lamb&Rice dry cat food, and they truly LOVE IT!  When you first open the bag you can smell the savory aroma!  Of the 3 cats that I found outdoor and adopted, one turned out to be a Turkish Angora and the other has markings similar to that of a snow leopard, and the third cat I found out is part Egyptian mau.  I also feed a feral cat who has been living in my back yard for 10 years.  They all love this food, and even when they changed the formula of this food a few years ago, they still eat it and love it!  If you read the ingredients, it is excellently made, and a real plus for their diet!  They've been eating it for years now, and I have yet to see any of my cats turn up their nose to this food.<br /><br />The other dry foods that my cats love is Fancy Feast Gourmet Filet Mignon Flavor with Real Seafood & Shrimp Dry Cat Food and they've just started eating Eagle Pack Natural Pet Food, Indoor Formula for Cats and a cat food brand called 'Artemis'.  I haven't any problems with them eating any of these dry foods, and I've been rescuing cats for over 30 years now, and have owned as many as 7 cats at one time.  One set of kittens were born outdoor and I brought them indoors with their mother and kept them all until the day they passed on(they all lived to be close to 20 years of age) and they too ate Eukanuba lamb&rice and loved it!<br /><br />I have had foods that they turned up their nose with like 'Chicken Soup' and 'Taste of the Wild'.  The same way we humans have our likes and dislikes is the same way that these cats have their likes and dislikes.  What's good for one cat might not be good for another.  You just have to learn your cat, and see what they like and just give it to them.  While my cats are in love with Eukanuba lamb&rice, maybe your cat will also or maybe not, but it isn't fair to not try this food because of a review where the owner says that their cat doesn't like it. As previously stated, maybe your cat will not like it or maybe your cat will love it!  I've tried cat foods based on good reviews figuring that the food will automatically be a hit and sometimes it was and sometimes it wasn't!  It's all up to the cat!"
positive,26/6/21,"When Pet Promise, a safe and healthy pet food, went out of business, I was desperately looking for another healthy food that had no by-products, rendered fats, meat meals, or outsourced ingredients. (You might want to check out what these types of ingredients can include - if your stomach can take it - but avoid commercial manufacturers' ""spins"" on this). Good books to get in this regard are ""Foods Pets Die For"" and ""Protect Your Pet"":<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0939165562"">Food Pets Die For: Shocking Facts About Pet Food</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0939165422"">Protect Your Pet: More Shocking Facts</a><br /><br />My cats were completely unaffected by the melamine contamination tragedy of 2007 - which killed many pets, especially cats - because their Pet Promise food was one of the few brands in America that didn't use outsourced ingredients (and was never on the recall list - unlike some of the very expensive ""premium brands""). I felt so lucky that I had already switched to Pet Promise, a petfood company that bought ingredients only from North American farmers using sustainable agriculture and free-range livestock.<br /><br />I finally discovered Halo's products, and was encouraged by the fact that Ellen DeGeneres, a devout animal lover herself, not only endorses it but also has become part-owner of the company. Their website also included a specific message written to us former Pet Promise users. So I went to my health-food store and bought some.<br /><br />I was delighted to see that it had no by-products, no rendered meats, no meat meals, and that the label stated that all its ingredients are ""Made in the USA"", except the pea protein from Canada. Furthermore, the salmon in Halo is wild Alaskan, not farmed salmon (aka, pharmed salmon, full of antibiotics, etc.). Moreover, it is low in carbohydrates and even includes probiotics in the mix! Making it even more promising than Pet Promise!<br /><br />But the ultimate test was whether my cats would eat it or not. Unlike my dachshunds, who would eat just about anything that hit the floor (they're really low to the ground, you know), cats are notorious for their persnickety eating habits. BUT THEY LOVE IT!!! Can't get enough! So I have to dole it out so they don't overeat! And after five months, their health and energy seem to be great.<br /><br />Oh, and hi, Ellen - and many thanks!"
positive,25/5/21,"Ironically, I am an Amazon seasonal worker.  I discovered these tasty treats while working on the sales floor...I kept thinking, ""Wow, I sure ship alot of these things; WHAT are they?""  So I went home and checked them out on line for myself...I am a very active and healthy person.  I am ALWAYS looking for wholesome breakfast options; I have a hard time eating in the AM...These cookies are so filling and delish!!  I eat one at around 8 am and I am FINE until lunch...Healthy ingredients to fuel your busy day/lifestyle...I can't wait to put them in my back pack when I go hiking next!!!!"
positive,7/9/21,"Slightly biased because this company was started near my hometown, but I've been a fan of Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookies for years since I first noticed them popping up at coffee shops back home.  Now living on the other side of the country I was pleasantly surprised to find them on Amazon, and even more excited to find them at such a great price!  Store them in the freezer, pop them in the toaster and it's like eating a fresh baked cookie that is full of good things for you and keeps you from getting hungry till lunch.  High in fiber and much better tasting than any energy bar out there, who doesn't love a cookie for breakfast?  I love these things, will be ordering more soon to keep our freezer well stocked!"

Pamela's Chocolate Chunk Cookie Mix was a revelation! Tastes as good as regular chocolate chip cookies,,,,delicious!"
positive,19/6/21,"These ""Whenever Bars"" taste like soft chocolate chip cookies. The coconut flavor is very good and natural tasting.<br /><br />Don't be deceived by the size of the package. The wrapper is much larger than the bar. Still, it is a satisfying snack and comes in at a respectable 180 calories.<br /><br />I eat them around mid-morning or as a late night snack. I do not avoid gluten, wheat, or dairy (these bars are wheat-free, gluten-free, and non-dairy) but do enjoy organic foods and was pleased to see healthy ingredients including oats, agave, chia seeds, brown rice flour, etc.<br /><br />Once these become available in the Subscribe and Save program I feel certain I will subscribe. They are great to have around for a low calorie, sweet treat."

positive,7/9/21,"Finding great tasting steel oats that cook as quickly as processed oatmeal is not easy to do. These oats can even be microwaved and never get gummy. I originally found these in California while visiting family and could not find them in Virginia when I returned home. You have to purchase two big bags minimum when getting them from the Internet,  and they are big bags, but I intend to share one with friends."
positive,3/8/21,"My husband and I have been making a serious effort to change our eating habits and be healthy, which is why I purchased this product. I was concerned about the highly processed vegetable oil we had been using, and the way the oil can become carcinogenic when cooked at high heat. Now, this is true for any oil; it should not be heated past it's "" smoke point "". Avocado oil has a very high smoke point, making it a perfect, healthy choice. It has healthy fats for your heart, and tastes yummy. I also recommend macadamia oil for the same reasons. Amazon shipped these right away, and they were perfect. If you have a Misto, this is a great oil to put in it! We will definitely keep this on hand."
positive,5/9/21,"I have a senentary job, and like to munch on things. After steadily gaining weight, I decided that what I was munching on wasn't doing me any favors. Enter dried and bake dried fruit. There is no guilt if I polish off an entire bag in one sitting, although, I do try to refrain from doing so.  The Bare Fruit brand is great. Because these are baked dried, they are crunchy, like chips. And the only ingredients are apples and cinnamon. Because of the shrinkage, you can eat more than you mean to, but it is far better than eating anything artificial. Amazon's price is very competitive. I originally bought these from Marshall's and TJ Maxx for two dollars, twenty nine cents."

positive,7/9/21,"My 14 month daughter loves these, she's been eating them since around 10 mos old.  Because 1/3 of the bag is a full fruit AND veggie serving, I sometimes give them to her along with her main dish at lunch time.  They're also great for snack time and it's good to know that they are healthy and count towards her daily fruit & veggie servings, when fresh fruit and veggies are not readily available.  I also love that both flavors of these fruit & veggie melts are a completely mess free snack, which is always a plus. :)"

positive,22/6/21,"I have started eating almonds as a healthy alternative to fatty or high-carb snacks, but wanted something to satisfy my sweet tooth on occasion. These Cocoa Roast almonds fit the bill nicely. They just have a dusting of cocoa, so there's no more fat or unhealthy stuff than you would find in regular almonds, but you still get a nice chocolate taste. They are just a little bit sweeter than I really want (I like dark chocolate, semisweet or bittersweet) but still a great once-in-awhile snack!"
positive,28/7/21,"These have a lot less sugar than other brands, but still a lot of chocolate flavor.  I'd eat plain almonds every now and then but they left my mouth dry.  These are addictive, and I eat them every day.  They make a great, healthy snack."

positive,19/2/21,"If your daily water consumption isnt at least 2.2L (for women; 3.3L for men) a day, then it really doesn't matter what kind of water you drink. Work on getting your consumption up to the minimum. If you are drinking upwards of a gallon of water a day, then picking a water of Atrisian type is greatly worth the health benefits. Also, plastic is quite detrimental to your health, so getting an item like Voss in the glass bottles instead of plastic is worth the price tag.<br /><br />Otherwise just buy 1 glass bottle of Voss and reuse the bottle if you feel the need to impress your friends. Trust me, no one drinks Voss to impress anyone. People who do are morons and everyone around them already knows it."
positive,10/1/21,"Pros:<br />No added sugar (1 g per 2 Tbsp serving)<br />No added salt (30 mg per serving)<br />Great taste<br />Organic<br />No stirring needed<br /><br />Cons:<br />Expensive, even for sunflower butter (we paid $6.20 per jar here at amazon, with free shipping)<br />Thin consistency (closer to a pourable topping than a 'butter')<br />A bit higher in calories than many nut/seed butters (220 cal per serving)<br /><br />This makes a nice optional butter for anyone with allergies (facility is peanut and tree nut free) or someone just looking for variety.  It is a bit messy to use because of how thin it is.  On the plus side, though, I'm sure I use less than a serving on my sandwich to avoid having it drip or squirt out, which keeps calories lower.  It remains thin when refrigerated, which the package recommends after opening to maintain freshness.<br /><br />We eat a reduced sodium and low sugar diet, and did find that we could tell that this was made without either.  It is definitely less sweet than a ""no added sugar"" peanut butter.  Since we usually make our sandwiches with either a banana or strawberries, we didn't mind the missing sweetness, but someone used to a more traditional butter product may.<br /><br />Amazon shipping on this product was fast and without any problems (USPS)."
positive,26/3/21,"I use SunButter as part of a program to lower blood pressure, and it works, but I'd eat SunButter anyway simply for the taste of it! If you love sunflower seeds, this is a product for you. Many people need the nutrients of sunflower seeds but can't digest seeds (folks with Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, for example). They can, however, enjoy the taste and nutrients of sunflower seeds with this product. I but this in multiples because so many friends and family members become hooked after trying a jar at my house! It tastes best (in my humble opinion) on toast.<br /><br />It is richer in healthy oils than other spreadable products, but I stir it up as soon as I open a jar, then refrigerate it. The oil doesn't separate again (although I do give it a quick stir with a knife before spreading it on toast).<br /><br />Highly recommended."

The 'Best By' dates are always good (this last pack had 13 months from purchase).  My family really enjoys the taste, though it doesn't taste like Kelloggs Raisin Bran.  Peace one cup serving has 190 calories; 2g fat; 170mg sodium; 44g total carbs; 8g dietary fiber; 9g sugar; 6g protein.  Kellogs one cup has same calories; 1g fat; 210mg sodium; 46g total carbs; 7g dietary fiber; 18g sugar; 5g protein.

positive,18/5/21,"These bars are great for a snack. They have alot of healthy ingredients and low sugar. The bars have a good flavor from the coconut. It is hard to find bars that don't have soy ingredients as well."
positive,19/2/21,"Have been using RiceSelect Royal Blend for years as the healthier, tastier alternative to plain brown rice and plain white rice. After my local supermarket stopped carrying it, I was delighted to find it on Amazon.com -- at a lower price than in the supermarket."
positive,14/12/20,if you want a healthy treat and one that is very satisfying try the lara bars. an important plus is that is soy free which is important to a lot of people these days.
positive,1/6/21,"I buy these for the whole family.  Coconut Cream Pie is our favorite flavor.  (We also like the chocolate varieties and Key Lime Pie.)  My 5yo and 2yo sons think these are a real treat since they are so sweet.  I love the simple, natural ingredients too.  They are a little pricey, but healthier foods usually are."
positive,1/4/21,"We really enjoyed this product -- containes no sugar (contains dates and such) and it's healthy while giving you the chocolate fix you need!"
positive,15/4/21,"Quitting sugar is HARD. Nana's cookies make it MUCH easier. I get to enjoy the sweet & chocolately taste I crave, without the sugar or chemicals in most other cookies. They are delicious and very satisfying. Because they are sweetened with fruit juice, my blood sugar does not get spiked, so I do not get a ""high"" followed by a crash after eating these cookies. Nor do I feel addicted to them, like I do when I eat products made with sugar. And, I like that they are gluten free, since we are bombarded by products made from wheat, and I crave a variety of grains, like oats and rice. I highly recommend these cookies - I eat them regularly and they fulfill my craving for sweets, which has been so helpful in making better food choices when I am faced with temptation. And on Amazon, they are priced very reasonably, and worth every penny."
positive,19/5/21,"My dog has numerous food allergies, so finding a treat that passes the allergy test AND one that he likes can be difficult.  Add to this the fact that he is definitely not motivated by food, and rewarding him with treats can be challenging.  My four-footed wonder absolutely loves the Get Naked Gut Health Dental Chew Sticks, and if he could, he'd give them five stars himself!"
positive,19/2/21,"After suffering from flu like symptoms for a week, I tried this tea with honey and it was not only delicious, but after using for a day... I feel so much better."
positive,14/12/20,"I am very careful these days what I eat due to a recent diagnosis. One of the things I watch is MSG - read some reports on it and you'll understand why. Everything in my cupboard had MSG in it. This does not. The risk is always, ""Will it taste good?"". MSG adds a lot of salt and what the brain reads as flavor and sometimes removing it can seem like a reduction in flavor. Not so with this product!! It is so good - I use it wherever and whenever I can. I am finding that I do not have to use very much so it goes quite far. I now have the vege, beef and onion flavored versions and they are all good. MMMMMMM...happy tummy!"
positive,28/7/21,"I bought these almonds because Amazon had a good sale going on. I really liked them. I usually buy a couple of pounds of unroasted unsalted almonds a week at the local grocery store sold by a well known national brand. These Back to Nature almonds were far superior. They were fresher. I also like the pack that could be resealed. They came in 3 convenient packs so that you don't have to have a huge bag open while you try to finish it.<br /><br />If you use almonds, you will enjoy these."
positive,29/6/21,"Great organic dog food from a company I trust. My dog eats it happily and heartily. With the automatic delivery option, the pricing is the cheapest I have been able to find, both on line and in the stores. Definitely recommend."
positive,15/10/21,"I prefer to stick with organic versions of the ""dirty dozen"" in produce (which, sadly, includes most berries), but I also try to follow my pediatrician's advice to have my son ""eat the rainbow"" each day. That gets tough, especially when we get into fall/winter, when fresh fruits and veggies are fewer and far between. Organic berries (like the strawberries and raspberries in this product) are expensive, hard to find, and definitely out of season right now here in NY. Enter Ella's Red One Smoothie Fruits. These pouches are great to have around as an option to round out my toddler's colorful fruit intake for the day. Not to mention, they're delicious - think applesauce, with sweet berries added for extra flavor and flair! And they're ideal when we're on the go. With a few of these tossed into my diaper bag, I always have something healthy and organic on hand for him to enjoy. They're even a nice snack for me when I find myself a bit low on energy when we're out and about. The crushed fruit inside these pouches is smooth (almost baby food consistency), so it slurps up through the straw-like top easily. Once I've unscrewed the cap, my 17 month old can eat this entirely without my help, leaving my hands free to get stuff done. Sweet!"
positive,20/7/21,"This bar is the perfect snack for late afternoon or whenever you feel lethargic or hungry, especially when you know you are eating something good for your body. I guess they are a bit expensive, but for a product that has added antioxidants, and is gluten free, i guess that's about right. At least Amazon offers a great discount."
positive,12/10/21,"Great product. No fat. All natural, nothing added. Great crunch and taste! Favorite company by far!"
positive,19/2/21,"I don't like cinnamon and I don't like apples, so I was surprised when a friend offered me <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017I753O"">Bare Fruit 100% Organic Bake-Dried Cinnamon Apple Chips, 2.6 Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> and I liked it. I figured I'd like it even more without cinnamon so I found these on Amazon and oh my... they are AMAZING!! I have eaten one full pound and have not experienced any bad chips like the one reviewer who said they were musty. My roommate ate the other pound and said one chip was incredibly sour, but all the others were great. The only reason I took off a star is because the packaging did not include nutrition information. It was easy enough to find on livestrong, but I definitely think it should be included. Because the chips are all different sizes they don't give an easy to visualize amount, say 1/4 cup = this many calories.. You really need a foods scale to know how much you're eating but in case its of any use to anyone, 24 grams of chips is 58 calories. 16 g is carbs, and 2 g fiber.<br /><br />I gave some to my dad to try. He grows about 10 different varieties of fruit trees, including apples. He said he's dried apples before and they taste the same as these! He takes care not to use anything non-organic or unhealthy so its good they taste the same! Also for some reason they store better in the shiny bag they ship in. I divided one bag into ziplocs to be able to grab for snacks, and they got sort of soft, whereas the chips kept in the original bag inside a ziplock stayed crispy and fresh."
positive,14/12/20,"I just got these in the mail today and can't stop eating them. No fat, no added sugar, just pure crunchy apple slices. They are wonderful!"
positive,2/7/21,"My dog LOVES these treats! The ingredients are so good for her and they don't cause any allergies or reactions either. Great product!"
positive,11/3/21,My kitties eat Wellness grainfree canned food and I wanted to try the pouches after others told me their cats loved them.  So do mine!  They eat the chunks first and then lick the gravy.  So now I feed them both the canned and pouches.  I love Wellness food for my cats.
positive,10/4/21,Received this set as a gift and they are a wonderful tasting product.  Perfect for my West Bend popcorn maker.
positive,22/7/19,"traverse bay cherries are awesome tasty . the last shipment we received may have been the freshest yet . we've been eating these cherries about 6 months and they seem to reduce pain associated with gout and arthritis . try them in oatmeal or farina ."
positive,2/2/20,"My son loves these snacks for lunch or car rides. I used to buy them at the grocery store in the organic section, but it's less expensive and more convenient to order them through Subscribe and Save. I have tried them as well and they are quite yummy."
positive,2/2/20,"I drink this tea all day long and its really good. Needs no flavoring, but sometimes I do add a little honey and make it into iced tea. That is yummy. Most times I drink it hot."
positive,31/8/19,"Good choice for healthy protein, satisfying and delicious. Interesting sweet and spicy taste! Portable protein for on the go energy!"
positive,22/7/19,"I love this organic coconut manna. I eat it by the spoonful and I use it for cooking. It has a light, pleasant coconut flavor. The packaging is convenient and keeps the product fresh. The benefits of coconut are wonderful. Give it a try!"
positive,12/1/20,"I take a spoonful of Coconut Manna every day. This is a blend of coconut oil and the coconut meat and it tastes sweet and yummy. Very good antifungal and a healthy oil for heart, brain, hair, joints. I use regular coconut oil for cooking. Some people complain about it separating, which is true, but I use a fork and rake it from the glass to the middle. Then it is easy to take a spoonful. You could gently heat it (in a pot of hot water) and then mix it up but I never heat it. I prefer the glass jar to the newer plastic they are using, but I am happy it is Organic."
positive,19/2/20,"These are absolutely delicious and healthier than other cookies since made with wheat flour, rice syrup and cane juice rather than white flour and sugar.  My kids love them and enjoy them as a snack with a glass of milk."
positive,27/11/19,green tea is a great diuretic and this is particularly tasty and soothing.Fresh product! green tea also has cholesterol lowering qualities along with fat burning and lots of antioxidants! Studies have been done using green tea for dementia and certain cancers as well. and no pill to swallow!
positive,12/12/19,"Liquid Aminos have been a staple in my food seasonings for a long time. I buy in bulk on Amazon, since its a much better deal and the bottles are so much bigger. I will never use regular soy again, since this literally tastes the exact same, yet is SO much better for you. I am so glad to have found this product and even more glad that Amazon sells it in bulk."
positive,26/9/20,These are great snacks for my kids and my teenagers even like them.  Better for them than high preservative and/or high calorie snacks and they give them some good carbs and protein.
positive,22/7/19,"These almond butter balls are a unique and delicious snack, chock-full of almond bits all over the exterior of the ""ball."" These provide a nice dose of fiber, protein, and healthy monounsaturated fats, which other snacks often lack. Unlike other Betty Lou's balls, this flavor does not contain whey (dairy) protein, so it is suitable for vegans or dairy-allergy sufferers. Also, just as a tip: these are very soft, so I always ""smush"" (thumb-knead) out the ball until it is a flat square, taking up the entire area of the plastic packaging -- they're much more satisfying to eat (pick at) and last longer that way. A great option when you're sick of ""bars."" I only wish they were organic (hence the missing star) and that Betty Lou's made more dairy-free balls!"
positive,2/2/20,My kids absolutely love these!  They appeal to all my kids from my 6 year old to my 14 year old.  We will be on automatic reorder from now on!!!!
positive,23/5/20,"I received my box of Pure Natural Bars right before going on a long road trip. I took several of the bars with me hoping that they would satisfy my hunger pangs while I traveled. I am pleased to report that these little snack bars did a great job of keeping my tummy happy and I didn't feel like I was eating something packed with preservatives or artificial ingredients. The mixture of fruits and nuts provides a sweet and nutty flavor experience that is a nice change from other bland or over-sweetened snack bars.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Natural Ingredients<br />- Pleasant Texture<br />- Great Taste<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Wrapper is a little difficult to remove due to bars being slightly sticky<br /><br />Overall I recommend these snack bars for anyone who wants a convenient snack on the go without feeling guilty about artificial ingredients."
positive,22/11/20,"I was pleased with the ingredients in these bars. I thought that there could have been a slightly bolder fruit flavor. The peanuts were plentiful, and that was a plus for me. Overall, I would rate them a good buy, and would definitely consider purchasing them."
positive,30/3/20,"It's a tub of mixed nuts, I'll spare you a long-winded review on them. I've tried the mixed nuts they sell locally, which have a lot of peanuts mixed in, and the difference in quality is pretty noticeable. These are much firmer, fresher, and just taste overall better. It seems the filler nut they used here were almonds, which is fine, and certainly better then peanuts, but it's unfortunate that pecans are scarce. Brazil nuts are pretty generously packed in as well, with moderate amounts of hazelnut (Filbert) and cashew. You get a lot of salt near the bottom, naturally, but otherwise there's just enough mixed in to assure that they stay flavorful from the moment you open them.<br /><br />I would recommend these to anyone looking for a mixed nut snack. Much better than the rest I've tried so far."
positive,8/7/20,"Started eating turkey jerky lately cause its a healthy snack and that's when I came across snackmasters. I have tried the beef, ahi tuna and salmon, all taste great!"
positive,4/1/20,"This is a great healthy product at a good price.  Not the first time I buy it, and not the last."
positive,30/1/21,"I'm on my second jar and we love this stuff. Originally bought for popping popcorn (fantastic) we soon started using it as a butter substitute for just about everything, toast, veggies, frying eggs or fish. I've had people who hate coconut anything love the mild sweet taste for popcorn. Between the coconut oil and the agave nectar found here I don't know which I'm happier with."
positive,2/11/20,"I use this more often than olive oil.  I use olive oil for salad dressings and an occasional stir- fry and this for most all other frying.  It has a light coconut flavor that took my 17 year old son some time to get used to, but he doesn't notice anymore.  I see people buying this in capsules as a supplement!"
positive,17/10/20,"These low fat rice crackers have just the right amount of wasabi heat. Fast service, great vender. Individual servings stay fresh until needed."
positive,22/7/19,"Unlike most snacks, this one is full of nutritious ingredients.  You won't feel guilty enjoying it!"
positive,2/2/20,"I picked Sahale cashews with pomegranate at a Starbuck's after coming from the gym. They are so tasty, not too sweet but sweet enough. I was delighted to be able to order them on Amazon. They are a bit pricey, but come out cheaper when you buy them in bulk vs. buying single packets in local stores. I will buy them again."
positive,4/10/20,"Like many other reviewers, I first found these apple chips at Costco, who has since discontinued them.  If I'd known they were going to be discontinued, I would have stocked up because they were about 50% cheaper!  But still the Amazon price is a good deal for such a large quantity of dried apples.  I eat them as a snack (I keep a bag at the office for this purpose) and I also use them as treats for my pet bunny (he goes absolutely bonkers for them). The quality is great; I haven't found a single seed or inedible piece in the four bags I've gone through so far.  Plus they are organic, which I do not normally care about but becomes important if you are ingesting any quantity of peels. Definitely recommend!!"
positive,1/4/20,"These apple chips are delicious and healthy for you. They are the perfect snack, especially if you are on a gluten free diet. I highly recommend them. They are a perfect alternative to potato chips."
positive,8/5/20,"I love eating these apple chips.  I tried ""Good Health Original Apple Crisps"" (these are the ones in the Fuji Apple salad sold at Panera Bread) and while yummy, they are fried and have more calories.  This particular variety by Bare Fruit is baked and has less than 60cal/serving so I consider this a win-win."
positive,18/6/20,Loved having a healthy snack that I could grab on the go...they became a staple for me...awesome solo or with hummus....
positive,20/8/20,"This is a very tasty and healthy cracker, full of dietary fiber.  I highly recommend it for taste, low calories, and texture."
positive,1/6/21,The hemp protein is not only a great buy but it has a pretty good taste especially when mixed with white grape juice(8 oz). Mixes easily with liquids. Love it and happy to be healthy. Great option for those with ulcerative colitis or lactose intolerence.
positive,4/7/21,"This is a tea that tastes wonderful.  It has many positive attributes, also.  It comes in this large box, 100 count bags.  I received good and speedy service from this seller."
positive,5/2/20,"This is a great product even though I am a health nut.  The Acai powder taste really good with my protein shake plus it has a high potency.  I will mix this powder with a chocolate protein shake and both taste and color changes which shows it's the real deal.  Even though it is a antioxidant product you have to eat right as well to feel the effect.  FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS really carefully put in the refrigerator after first use or else it will spoil."
positive,22/7/19,"I have been purchasing this item directly at Target once a week for the past four months, and have been very satisfied with each purchase. The nuts taste fresh, they are crunchy, and a good variety. No peanuts!!! I made the transition from slated nuts to these<br />without any trouble, because they are so good. A great product that you will feel good about eating."
positive,2/2/20,"I've enjoyed this product for several years, and it was very convenient for me to be able to get it in the mail from Amazon. Thank you."
positive,22/11/20,"These are wonderful baked beans, with subtle, not overwhelming, curry seasoning.  Also very healthy--protein, fiber, no saturated or trans fat. Only minor caveat is sodium, a bit high, but nothing like many beans/""bowls"" found in US stores."
positive,1/3/20,"I switched my dogs to this food and I have noticed many improvements in there overall health.  They have shinny healthy coats of fur, more energy and more regular and solid bowel movements.  I care about my dog's health and this product delivers good healthy ingredients and my dogs really love it!"
positive,23/11/20,"Tastes amazing, good for you, small, 170 or so calories.<br /><br />You can eat this on the go or at home for a morning snack or at work in between meals.<br /><br />Perfect in every way, and organic!<br /><br />The only ""con"" i have is the price, it's almost 2 dollars a bar, which is kinda high for buying in bulk (it is a small bar after all).<br /><br />The organic protein bars I usually use contain almost twice the calories, are still raw and organic (though not as good tasting as this strawberry bar), comes in at about the same price.  It can be used as a meal replacement, which makes it worth the value.<br /><br />If amazon could offer this as a subscribe and save option and get the price down to 16-18 dollars, I would highly recommend this, and subscribe to get new ones delivered to my house twice a month.<br /><br />These things are AMAZING"
positive,5/4/21,"For the past 5 years, my husband has been experimenting with making whole grain pancakes. He is constantly trying new whole grain pancake mixes out on the family. We were visiting some friends in Brooklyn when he discovered the Kodiak Cakes at a small deli. He bought the box and made them for us and we couldn't believe how amazing these whole grain pancakes are. They are super tasty and made with amazing ingredients. Hands down the best whole grain pancake mix I have ever had. We bought 12 boxes to start giving away as gifts when we go to someone's house (instead of giving a bottle of wine)!"
positive,27/4/20,"I boil rice and Quinoa together & after rinsing, will add about 1/4 cup of Go Raw Freeland Live Sprouted Seeds to it. The seeds naturally add flavor and a slight crunch to the rice and Quinoa. Nothing else needs to be added. All of the flavors mix together to provide a healthy and tasty meal."
positive,8/3/21,"Sometimes I see myself going for unhealthy snacks from vending machines. Now I take this with me everywhere I go.  It's perfect for quick snack - healthy, perfect portion, & delicious!"
positive,30/1/20,"I switched to Celtic sea salt for added minerals, and also because the body can process it better than table salt. The taste is unbelieveable!! It highlights every flavor of your food! I am so impressed I refuse to go back to table salt for any reason! It is damp, due to being taken directly from a sea bed. Althoug I did not get the grinder the company offers, instead I got one at Target. It works ok, I do have to shake the grinder sometimes to get it to work freely with the damp salt. Overall, I am extermely impressed with this salt."
positive,22/7/19,"My dogs love these sweet potato treats.  I feed my dogs grain-free diets and other high-end supplements, so of course I wanted a treat that followed our feeding ethic. This is low in protein and fat, so it is gentle on the stomach of puppies and sick dogs alike. My dogs go crazy over these. They love the taste and since these are a little tough, it takes them a bit longer to finish them, which is great because dogs usually swallow treats whole. They are not extremely tough though. Puppies can eat them. Even though the bag does not have an indication to refrigerate after opening, please do so. They will last longer and remain fresher. Plus, you could prevent mold growth. Amazon sells these by far at the most affordable price. Specialty stores sell these treats up to twice as much as Amazon does, so I suggest you buy them from Amazon. If you want a healthy treat, this is the way to go. :)"
positive,2/2/20,"You know how limited your food choices can be when your plane is delayed and the airport is pretty much closing down for the night? Well, that's how I found Mrs. Mays Cran-Blueberry Crunch.  The candy and gum kiosk at LaGuardia carries them, and I was not going to make it tbrough a 2 hour delay on a Snickers.  The Cran-Blueberry Crunch was wonderful.  Hit the spot and carried through with no sugar crash.  They're delicious without being overly sweet and the fruit is real fruit, not dried fruit with yucky preservatives.  When I got hom, I couldn't find it locally, so I ordered a case from Amazon, and I keep a bag in my desk drawer (for that late afternoon snack attack).  I've shared with my friends, and everyone loves it.  Enjoy!!"
positive,2/9/20,"Kind makes a range of great products with minimal additives and fresh, bright flavors. These clusters are nice and crunchy, and great for any granola-type use. The clusters are not very big, so this product is better for me as a yogurt topper or breakfast cereal than snacking. The blueberry-vanilla flavor was a bit muted but I'm happy to compromise on that for such a hearty, healthy product."
positive,26/1/21,"I've tried a number of different granola cereals over the years (including the Kind Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds ), and Kind Healthy Grains ranks among the best for taste. I'd call this moderately sweet, which is just fine with me, but it might make this less of a hit with people with more of a sweet tooth, especially kids. Of course, you can always add sugar, fruit or some other sweetener if you think it needs it.<br /><br />As the nutrition facts on the package reveal, this is a fairly healthy breakfast option. There's little fat in a 1/3-cup serving (3.5g/5% total fat, none of which is saturated or trans fat) with no cholesterol. There are 22g/7% carbs of which only 5g/20% are from sugar. There are also 5g/20% fiber, 20mg/1% sodium, and a serving has 130 calories."
positive,9/1/21,"I think we have a winner here. The packaging promises that the product is all natural, and only contains things you can pronounce. It does, too.<br /><br />Flavor was very nice, and not too sweet. This product contains flax, which I don't particularly care for, but the flax wasn't noticeable. This does have a decent amount of sesame seeds in it. While I don't mind the taste of sesame seeds they did tend to get stuck in my teeth.<br /><br />I ate this both dry and as a cereal with milk. It was great  both ways.<br /><br />To me the real test for any food is: will my kids eat it? In this case the answer is a resounding yes. Additionally, I brought this along to munch on at a swim meet, and the kids on the team wanted a taste. They all liked it, too."
positive,30/7/21,"This is an extremely tasty seaweed snack.  The biggest plus to this product however, is the fact that it is roasted with Olive Oil.  Most commercial seaweed snacks are roasted in rancid, unhealthy canola oil or soybean oil.  So the only option for health conscious people was to buy the raw nori sheets and roast them ourselves, which is fine but a bit of a pain.  Kudos to SeaSnax for stepping in and filling the void.  The only downside is they are a bit pricey but that sometimes happens when a company is first to market with a compelling product.  Hopefully others will get in on the act and competition will drive the price a bit.  Also, there is no real ""Amazon"" discount vs buying at Whole Foods, but not everybody lives near a WF and not all WF's stock this product."
positive,30/10/20,I love that my son is learning to feed himself with these healthy snacks that he loves!
positive,3/8/20,"LOVE this stuff! Since reading that olive oil is best just used for cold, not cooked items, I use it for cooking as well as a condiment on sandwiches, a spread on whole grain breads, and even added to protein shakes. It is soooo healthy. Anyone reading up on it should make sure they are reading current info--not old, no longer valid statements. I even use it on my face.<br />I ordered a jar to see if I liked it, which I do, and have since gone on Amazon's auto-ship program: Couldn't be more convenient. Good price savings, too."
positive,29/1/21,"THIS ITEM IS GREAT.  100% FRUIT AND STILL GREAT TASTING.  MY KID LOVES THESE THINGS.  HE IS A LOVER OF FRUIT SNACKS AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT IS HEALTHY AND TASTEFUL AND I'VE FOUND IT."
positive,24/10/21,"I tried these for my two sons since they need to bring their own snacks to school every day and needed something made in a facility without peanuts.  They are healthy and not too high in sugar.  My sons think they taste ok, but not great."
positive,24/10/21,This bar was recommended by my strength and conditioning coach.  It tastes great and ingredients are very good.
positive,16/10/21,These are very delish - crunchy & flavorful - easy to transport for kids lunches and helps provide the daily requirements for fruit.
positive,24/10/21,This mix is really good . . . thanks for making our healthy transition easy.  The whole family enjoyed super healthy pancakes this weekend!
positive,25/9/21,"I tried these before ordering them in bulk and cheaper from Amazon.com.  They are a great nut snack with very low sugar content and high protein content.  While a bit dry, they have good flavor and are good for you.  Much better than most so called energy bars.  And reasonably priced if ordered in bulk through Amazon.com."
positive,19/10/21,"You can find these here with free shipping and it will save you a trip to the bumper car parking lot of the mall.<br /><br />This is higher quality dog food. I know you may not care, but most brands they sell in the supermarket are really bad for your dog shaving off years of their life.<br /><br />I buy the weight control formula for Becky the Beagle and she has lost enough wieght to actually run! And she did so without starving if that's even possible for a Beagle.<br /><br />Worth every penny if you can get the free shipping. I have a $500.00 deductable on my car and hate going to the mall bumper car parking lots."
positive,20/10/21,"This tasty cereal has everything going for it. It taste good and has 46 grams of whole grains, which is 96% of your daily minimum of whole grain needs from one bowl. It has a decent amount of fiber and calcium. Good for your morning breakfast or as a snack when you are on the run."
positive,19/10/21,"I'm happy to have found a drink flavor mix that uses the healthier option of Stevia.  Tastes pretty good.  I use it with a fiber mix so it's just fine.  Fiber drinks like metamucil typically have the less healthy sweeteners so I just buy Konsyl and mix it with the Stevita."
positive,15/6/21,"Sliced cucumbers and a packet of Justin's Nut Butter Natural Maple Almond Butter makes a perfect healthy on-the-go snack. I love it and more importantly, my kids love it."
positive,4/8/21,"In my attempt to buy healthier snacks that don't have high fructose corn syrup, artificial sweeteners and processed sugar, I discovered these Raw Revolution bars.  They are GREAT!  We've tried several flavors and love them.  They are great for on-the-go snacks and are made with whole ingredients."
positive,4/8/21,"Other reviewers must have expected these to taste like candy bars, which they don't.  But they are delicious!  Pay no attention to the bad reviews if you like real food!  My mother and I recently switched over to these instead of other energy bars because they have real ingredients instead of junk and fillers and what a difference!  They are dense and chewy without being dry, and are all-in-all wonderful."
positive,18/7/21,"I really love this stuff!  I just discovered this from one of those cooking shows on TV and wanted to try it.  It is difficult to find Farro in regular grocery store, and not everyone has an Italian grocery store close to them. It's just really convenient to order from Amazon with free shipping. It arrived very quickly."
positive,18/10/21,"This is a great snack! It tastes great and it's healthy and tasty --a nice alternative to nuts and dried fruits--perfect for tossing into a backpack before a hike, watching the game, or for an on-the-go snack. The 8-packs will tide me over until there's a family-size pack available."
positive,15/6/21,"I stumbled upon these cookies while shopping at Target and instantly fell in love with their amazing chocolate taste, not to mention their healthy ingredients. I was so disappointed to find that Amazon does not carry these and they have to be bought through another seller. If they were on Subscribe and Save I can promise you I'd be the first to set up a monthly order!! Come on Amazon-give these delicious cookies a chance!!"
positive,4/8/21,"I love these!  I found these initially at Sam's and then they discontinued selling them.  I was so glad when I found them on Amazon.  They are such a healthy and tasteful snack! They really taste good and my son and daughter-in-law have started eating them and love them too!"
positive,8/6/21,"My dog loves these treats and I have to admit, they smell pretty delicious; I resisted temptation to nibble one, though. You can't go wrong with the healthy ingredients, either."
positive,15/6/21,"Not only are these organic purees healthy, they are actually pretty tasty. Our baby devours these on their own or mixed with other foods. The packaging is very convenient for meals at home or on the go. Even my adult palate was pleased with the little taste I had. The only potential negative is that they're a little on the pricey side."
positive,4/8/21,"These crunchy snacks are healthy, addictive, and tasty. I love the crisp texture, the flavors, and the perfect size for a snack. Much better than the Apple Chips that have all that added junk and sugar. These Sensible Foods Snacks are just dried fruit! Love the apple harvest flavor best, then tropical blend. A favorite snack item!"
positive,25/9/21,"This is a good product for the cat's teeth. You can get a cat interested in them by a) giving them when the cat is hungry and/or b) breaking them into smaller pieces to they can bite them more easily and to release the enticing poultry smell so they know they are not eating a rock."
positive,19/10/21,"It's really tasty and easy to cook.<br />And it is less than 250 calorie. It's helpful to lose my weight."
positive,4/9/21,"The Oatmeal Raisin bars by Quaker are a tasty treat, but unlike some bars, they aren't too sweet or too bland. They have enough sweentess to make them flavorful, but don't go to extremes. They are relatively low in fat content (90 calories, 15 fat calories) and pretty convenient to have with you if you just want a quick snack, but don't want anything too heavy. They are also appropriate for any time when you get a little craving for something unhealthy (something you might regret), something like potato chips or cookies. For this reason, they are a healthy alternative to ""junk"" food. I tend to like to eat them for breakfast, but they are also an excellent ""in between"" meals snack. In stores, it will cost you about three or four dollars for a pack of 10. I've tried a few of the others kinds made by Quaker Oats, but these are my favorites."
positive,31/8/21,This soup makes a great lunch or light supper.  It makes an easy and inexpensive lunch for work or school.
positive,9/10/21,"Love this cereal.  Protein packed, keeps me full.  Grateful for a no sugar option in a world of sugary sweet cereals."
positive,15/6/21,"If you're into healthy living, you'll love this product - high in protein and fiber, sugar-free, all natural.  Just add milk and your favorite fruit and you have a tasty breakfast cereal.  Good for a snack too, although it can get messy if eaten dry."
positive,4/8/21,"I started buying this cereal at the store after reading a recommendation about how much healthier sprouted grains are. Since it is rather expensive, I found that I could save a couple of dollars per box by buying it from Amazon. To my taste the cereal doesn't need any added sugar or anything to taste good and I like the consistency too. I also buy the almond flavor for variety."
positive,15/6/21,"When we lived in Louisville, we had a Fresh Market close to us. We used to buy Crispy Green dried fruit there. We now live in a state that doesn't have any Fresh Markets anywhere, and haven't been able to find this product in any other store. So, we always order these off of  Amazon. They're very good for toddlers learning how to chew table food. Also a healthy snack for everyone, and those with an allergy to sulfur (such as myself) which is found in other dried fruit, this is a good option."
positive,4/8/21,"Good snack that doesn't have oil, salt, sugar, etc. I keep the jar in a draw at work and avoid the candy machine."
positive,15/6/21,"very healthy and low cal. why eat chips, this is salty and crispy. I also appriciate the great price from amazon."
positive,4/8/21,This bread is a real treat. Dense with healthy ingredients. It is a real bargain compared to other health food breads. We are hooked !
positive,1/10/21,"Not many processed foods are healthy.  Mary's Gone Crackers is about as good as it gets.  I enjoy them most with some raw almond butter that I get at Trader Joe's.  Six to ten of these crackers with the almond butter satisfy my need for a ""crunchy"" snack and I get a healthy blend of protein and carbs."
positive,1/7/18,"This penne pasta is delicious. My family prefers it to the regular wheat-based pasta. And it's good for you to, and gluten-free."
positive,10/8/18,"In search of healthy but tasty snacks I discovered these cookies, a bit sweet, but with a nice ginger touch. Even my daugter likes them. We also buy the Pamela's Peanut Butter cookies."
positive,1/7/18,"My daughter is so limited in what she can eat( no sugar, wheat, grains, dairy, etc.) and this is one sweet that she can have and not get ill. The plus side is they taste great and the price was pretty good too!"
positive,10/8/18,"My son is on a Gluten Free diet and finding good healthy snacks that fall into that category, and that taste good enough for him to eat...is very hard.  He loves these bars.  He thinks they taste like cocoa krispies and would eat the whole box if he could.<br />They are packed full of vitamins and minerals and are organic for those that are concerned about that.  These bars are on average, pretty expensive in the stores, but I can purchase them off Amazon for much cheaper and I usually buy them in bulk.<br />If you have a picky eater, or if anyone is on a specific diet, these might be something to consider.  As many know, it is hard to find Gluten free snack products that taste very similiar to regular ones and these really do make the cut.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E46GFA"">EnviroKidz Organic Koala Crispy Rice Bars, Chocolate, 6-Count Bars (Pack of 6)</a>"
positive,13/9/18,s a frequent shopper (and snacker) of health food stores across the tri-state area i consider myself an expert on healthy snacks.  these are my absolute favorite. i can eat an entire bag in one sitting!
positive,17/7/18,"The Holistic dog food from Bench and Field is my dog's favorite. The ingredients are excellent and I can pronounce all of them! There is good meat content and grains are kept to a minimum. There are a couple of fillers in there that I could do without, but, as far as fillers go, they are less objectionable ones.<br /><br />The kibbles are small, great for small dogs and toy breeds like my Tibetan Spaniel. I learned about this food because they carry it at Trader Joe's. More reviews at my dog blog, BadDogBaxter.com."
positive,16/1/19,"As someone who has cooked for her dogs for 4 yrs now, I was not too happy to switch back to dry dog food when meat prices soared. I had previously given one of my dogs Blue Buffalo so I knew it was a good quality food. Most of the time, my dogs are eating Blue Buffalo dry dog food and always gobble it up. Since I'm comparing to the home cooked meals I make, I find the dogs drink a lot more water and have more stools which isn't fun for clean up. Otherwise, the dogs are maintaining a good weight and their coats look healthy with a supplement of Salmon oil each day. Overall, I'm satisfied with this product."
positive,16/1/18,Walnuts are an extremely healthy snack if eaten in moderation (one serving is 200 calories).  I especially like them as a salad topper.
positive,16/1/19,"My husband and I both reach for these any time we need a little snack. They are tasty, have only healthy ingredients. Best of all we can eat several as the calorie count for them is 22 per large cracker!!  We have even taken them on vacations as they weigh next to nothing so they add no weight to our luggage."
positive,1/8/20,"This is a healthy breakfast.  It hasn't changed in the over forty years I have been using it.  The taste is great and you can use them as crackers if you want."
positive,1/7/18,"While more expensive than most fruit snacks, these are great because there is no sugar added and my kids really like them. I have been buying the Stretch Island brand for several years now, and the price I paid through amazon was decent."
positive,10/8/18,"This shipped very fast to my base in Afghanistan. Was a fresh treat, the crackers are lightly salted and the amount of cheese is a nice amount. Yummy and healthy at the same time"
positive,15/2/20,"A dog trainer suggested we switch to grain free dog food for our two dogs. The young Jack Russell mix not picky at all, but the elderly Shih Tzu will sometimes refuse to eat. The trainer also suggested we steam the dry food with boiling water so the dogs, especially the Shih Tzu, could smell it. We've been using this brand for some time now, and both dogs love it. Steaming it produces a bit of a gravy. It also softens the food which is helpful for the Shih Tzu. We've tried different types and flavors of dog food in the past, but this one is still a huge hit with the dogs. They also seem quite healthy and active on it."
positive,22/4/21,I have thouroughly enjoyed preparing and eating this product. Reasonably priced compared to grocery store prices.
positive,25/9/20,"My doctor advised me to avoid enriched pasta - Bionatura products are the perfect solution - delicious, healthy, and Amazon's price is right!"
positive,16/11/19,"I was pleased to find these on Amazon. A good, healthy, portable snack for my daughter who is starting finger foods, & way cheaper than Gerber's mini veggies. My 10 month old daughter doesn't have any teeth yet, and she has no problems eating them. They're light, fluffy, and full of flavor. A good sweet snack without all kinds of added sugar!"
positive,9/9/20,"We love these pecans! The citrus and pepper and sweet taste is so yummy.  We can't get enough of these and we think they make a great snack.  They're also very good on a salad."
positive,1/7/18,This is a great value especially on subscribe and save and keeps well with the re-sealable top. Red quinoa has a great flavor and the color is appealing if you are introducing quinoa to a newbie. The protein benefit is nice as well.
positive,10/8/18,"I've never had quinoa but I've read and heard enough about it to finally give in and order some.  This is a lot cheaper than what you would find at Whole Foods and Trader Joe's and it's delicious (not to mention great for you).  If you're just getting into Quinoa just search for some recipes on Google - try the quinoa and black bean recipe, it's awesome.<br /><br />As far as the product goes, it's very neatly packaged and prewashed, so you don't need to rinse it.  The pouches are easy to open and close and that's good because you probably won't use all 16 ounces in one sitting.  The red qunioa looks great in salads, with cereal, or on it's own!"
positive,15/1/20,"I was glad to find this for sale on Amazon.  We used to buy another brand of quinoa but we moved and can't find it in our area. Everyone in our family loves it.  Cooks just like rice, but has it's own flavor and very healthful."
positive,1/9/20,"These diet bars are very tasty with a nice flavor of dark chocolate and a pleasant, non-sticky crunch. With 6 grams of protein and 9 grams of fiber to 6 grams of sugar and only 120 calories, they offer a much healthier snack option than the typical vending machine choices or even a lot of so-called diet products.<br /><br />I have successfully used the South Beach Diet over the past few years both to loose weight and to improve my cholesterol and I have incorporated its principles into the way that I eat all year long.<br /><br />Like some other programs, the first phase of the South Beach Diet encourages morning and afternoon snacks and allows a dessert in the evening. These diet bars are a good choice for anyone on such a program, or really for anyone who just feels like having a healthy and tasty snack or light dessert from time to time. I liked them, and my wife liked them, too."
positive,22/7/21,"A pretty tasty cereal. Supposedly healthy and pretty chocolaty. Can't feel guilty eating this every morning. I'm a big fan of the whole mini-wheats line, and a big fan of chocolate, so this really hits the spot in the mornings. (FYI, if you really like chocolate too, consider Krave, thought I'm guessing it's not as healthy as mini wheats)."
positive,1/7/18,"The Just Tomatoes brand combines nutrition and fresh taste.  The whole family loves these freeze-dried strawberries, but of most important note, my 2 year old loves these (even though she won't eat fresh strawberries).  They are less messy too!  We like to take them on the road when we're traveling so we get some fruit in when it's not convenient to eat fresh.<br /><br />The other reviews are accurate in their description of texture loss - especially in humid climates.  However, the strawberries are still tasty when they are a little chewy.  In fact, I prefer them that way.  This is one of the few fruits my husband will take in his lunch!"
positive,10/8/18,"My three-year-old loves these. They always come quickly, they're crunchy, sweet (but not overly sweet), and delicious. I will be ordering these many more times."
positive,14/5/21,"I discovered this at my local grocery store and loved it.  Went looking for it cheaper and found it here.  Was shocked by the 2 poor reviews.  Come on - you chose a very healthy whole wheat gnocchi, with a very minimal ingredient/additive list.  Did you think it would taste as ""good"" as the versions loaded with white flour, sugar and oils?  The product cooks very easily and absorbs the delicious flavors of whatever sauce I put over it."
positive,17/10/19,"I really like this popcorn and go through it so fast, although Orville Redibacker's smartpop version is better. If you're looking for the tradional kettle corn however, don't order it. It's not as sweet and does not have all that oil that makes the true kettle corn flavor so it may not be what you're looking for."
positive,3/10/21,"Eat Right 4 Your Type suggested this bean was very good for my bloodtype (O).  I use in chili (1 lb. grass fed beef, 46 oz. tomato juice, 1 can aduki/adzuki beans drained, 1 can white kidney beans (Eden) drained, and 1 pkg. chili seasoning. This bean can also be used in a popular asian smoothie recipe as well as mixed with rice and seasoning. Cans are BPA free:)"
positive,15/9/20,"I'm not intolerant to gluten, but I do keep an eye out for healthy snack foods. These oat raisin walnut spice bars have an unusual consistency, rather like fruit cake, but they sure taste better than fruitcake! They're not overly sweet, and it's actually possible to detect the flavors of oats, raisins, walnuts, and spice (mainly cinnamon), and they go well with a nice, hot cup of tea."
positive,30/8/20,"I really like snacks that you don't feel bad about while enjoying the flavor, so this one has made it on my list!"
positive,1/7/18,"I am on a GFCF diet and Blood Type O diet so I am very limited on what I can eat. I first found Bone Suckin' Sauce at the Fresh Market after months of searching for a natural barbeque sauce that tasted good. I figured I would give it a try and was pleasently surprised...it's delicious! Now, every week I cook grass-fed ground beef/turkey bacon/onions and mix a little sauce in. I could eat this dish every day!"
positive,10/8/18,Acai is one of the most powerful superfoods. I take a shot daily and have noticed increased energy levels and improved digestion.
positive,5/12/19,"These are tasty snacks that are healthy for you.  They're a bit pricey unless you buy them on sale and in bulk."
positive,21/10/19,"If you want to eat healthy this is it.  It tastes pretty good, but I add a little bit of honey to it and let it soak in milk for about 1/2 hour before eating it for breakfast."
positive,8/9/20,"I thought it was an excellent product and plan on ordering it again.  A little sooner than I anticipated because some mice got into it.  I finally decided t poison the mice, they had gone too far!"
positive,22/9/21,"During a recent trip to Ireland, I got to try Muesli.  I had no idea what it was when I first had it, but then when I got back to the states I was so disappointed that I couldn't find anything like what I had.  Then my friend said she found some in the grocery store, and it was this!  It is almost exactly the same, no added preservatives, sweeteners, or anything.  It's all natural deliciousness, and I found that buying it here saves about $10 over the supermarket.  I highly recommend it."
positive,2/10/20,My dogs adore these.  And it is great to give a treat that I know is not full of fillers and chemicals. Handy bite sized pieces.
positive,25/7/20,"These are a great snack when you're on the go.  Unlike most fruit bars, they have a bit of fiber in them, making them far healthier and longer lasting."
positive,4/7/21,"It is a slim packet with mostly tuna meat and not much water.  Make sure you bring a small spoon to get every bits out.  It was a little hard to use my fingers to eat.<br /><br />I bought it primarily for backpacking and hiking.  It is light weight, healthy, and fulfilling as a part of my lunch.  The calorie count is good (80 per packet) and the taste is not bad when the body screams for fuel.  I can also see it being added into rehydrated TVP, rehydrated instant refried beans, and canned soup, etc..<br /><br />I also put a few packets in my cubicle in case i get hungry.  it's a super healthy snack (if u prefer savory snack).<br /><br />Overall I am very happy to have it in my pantry so that I can grab it whenever i need one or two."
positive,11/9/21,"This soup is totally delicious. I don't even know how to describe it. It's just great. It has a little zing to it. Not too spicy though; I don't like spicy things, and I like it.<br /><br />Be sure to let it set for a while after you cook it. The texture is much smoother after you let it sit."
positive,4/7/21,"Found these wonderful almonds during Christmas time last year.  Went back to the same store and they didn't have them, so I looked them up on Amazon and was pleased to see they are in stock. They are a real treat. My family and friends love them."
positive,21/9/21,"I was feeding my Corgi Science Diet Nature's Best and Merrick puppy food, but as he got closer to turning one I needed to get him on adult food. It's very important to me to feed him healthy food that has low grain content and a higher protein content. The foods he was on were making him have slightly runny stools, and I did a lot of research before settling on Wellness Core. My second option is Canidae, which gets high reviews as well. He really likes this food, and the pieces are nice sized, not too big and not too small so he can choke them down."
positive,11/9/21,"There are very few unsalted snacks available for those with salt related high blood pressure.  My mother looks forward to receiving her monthly supply of cashews.  Always fresh, always tasty and always safe for her to eat."
positive,12/10/21,"I'm not a big health freak and love soda and everything sugary and bad for you, but this stuff is incredible. Many people want to compare this to Izze, but Izze is only 70% compared to The Switch's 100%. And you can taste the difference in how natural the product is. Since I bought this to give up soda, the fizziness gives your brain a feeling that it's the same unhealthy soda you normally have, but the rest of your body will feel the difference. It definitely costs a bit more that a 24 pack of soda, but compared to Naked juice (the other delicious 100% juice beverage) it's a bargain deal."
positive,11/10/21,my 4yr old son loves these as well as all the children I babysit! Hard to find where I live so I will continue to purchase thru amazon...even set up auto delivery! great price and fast shipping
positive,28/9/21,"I LOVE this trail mix...it's sooo good! Although the cost is more expensive on here than I pay at the store. Will continue to buy in-store."
positive,19/10/21,"This was my first time ordering this product.  It was a great snack.  I love chocolate and this snack was a great alternative to chocolate candy from the vending machine.  They are easy to carry and if you don't finish all of it in one sitting the bar doesn't dry up since it's not made up of a bread."
positive,4/7/21,"It is great to be able to get a healthy snack in the mail here in Afghanistan!  Appreciated that the mango has not additives or preservatives, just natural and delicious.  Thanks!"
positive,11/9/21,"I found this product to be delicious! My husband and I both tried it first and thought it was super easy to prepare and really yummy!  We loved that you could recognize all the ingredients and eat ""convenience"" food without all the added junk!  The crust was flaky and delish and the mac and cheese was the perfect size.  I am definitely planning on reordering!  Great on babysitter nights for the kids!"
positive,12/9/21,"I have looked locally and cannot locate sardines packed in tomato, let alone the nice small sardines.  These are absolutely delicious and I am very happy I selected the autoship option."
positive,13/7/21,"Post Honey Nut Shredded Wheat is a very nutritious and fulfilling cereal. My entire family loves it, exspecially my 7 year old daughter. We even enjoy eating them without milk, which serves as a great snack. I strongly recommend Post Honey Nut Shredded Wheat to families concerned about healthy eating."
positive,23/10/21,"This soup is a staple in England, with its creamy texture and sweet tomato flavor it makes an excellent meal alone, or you can dunk bread in it, or grate some cheese in before heating - any way you eat it, it won't disappoint. It has the added benefit of having no artificial colors, preservatives or flavors in it."
positive,22/9/21,"I bought this product for my research lab, and all the other grad students loved them... They are not just for kids. This product tastes good with an excellent texture that is not too gummy.  Also, as a bonus, they are decently healthy with no hydrogenated oils and protein to boot!!!!  I honestly could care less about nutrition but our lab nutritionist gave them the thumbs up."
positive,4/7/21,"Flax Plus is proof that heathy cereal does not have to taste like treebark.  I am diabetic, so I wanted a cereal that provided low carbs, low fat, fiber, and one that tasted good.  I finally found that combination in Flax Plus.<br /><br />Hint-  keep an eye out for the big 33oz packages.  Such a deal!"
positive,11/9/21,"This cereal is absolutely delicious!  It even tastes good if you are eating it as chips!  The multibran and high fiber content are good for your health, too."
positive,8/8/21,"Got this shipped to the office and have been eating it for breakfast.  Its healthy, its tasty, and its cheap.  Beat that..."
positive,9/7/21,"This cereal is very tasty, and stays crunchy in milk. It makes a healthy snack as well. The whole family loves it."
positive,24/10/21,I had had a very hard time trying to find Quaker Banana Bread Oatmeal.  I was quite excited when I found it at Amazon.  The service was excellent. The price was right.  I am delighted to have my oatmeal again.
positive,4/7/21,I love this cereal i eat it every morning adding maple syrup makes even more satisfying
positive,11/9/21,"We have a 4 year old granddaughter and another grand-baby on the way, so when we saw these snacks on Amazon, we thought we'd try them out to see if they would be healthy and TASTY for a child. No good having a healthy snack that the kids won't eat, huh?  Sara (the 4 year old) is such a picky eater that we had serious doubts, and thought she may turn up her nose as she does with so many other healthy foods. She LOVES the Little Ducks! It feels so good to give her something she loves that is helping her grow and develop without all the processed additives and sweeteners. We love too that the package has a zip-top closure and fits easily into a purse. Go to the Little Ducks web site, too."
positive,24/10/21,"Always fresh and rare empty shell. A good value for the money. I've shopped around alot and found this to be the best deal."
positive,22/6/21,By removing the sodium from this drink it becomes a wonderful alternative to citrus juices.  If you prefer more tang add lemon juice or fresh cracked pepper.
positive,30/7/21,"A very tasty, organic 7g of protein and 5g of fiber, with only 9g of sugar and 200 calorie snack which is good for those on the go or those who who just want something healthy. This combination (Peanut Raisin Crunch) is very tasty."
positive,10/7/21,"I love watching TV munching on this.  It's got NOTHING IN IT but the vegetables!  Much healthier than ... anything else!  It's not super cheap, but it's super healthy."
positive,4/7/21,"We recently fell in love with Indian food.<br /><br />Papads (after quickly toasted in a HOT oven) can be a healthy alternative to potatoe chips.  They are excellent alone or dipped in chip dip.<br /><br />They are a very thin bread.  When cooked they are brittle and crisp, just like potatoe chips.  However they are baked, not fried and made of chickpea flour which is a little more healthy than potatoe chips."
positive,11/9/21,"rye oats wheat rice and barley are not part of a dogs evolutionaly history so why feed unnatural foods. Dogs are carnivors. Green Cow is a good value and will extend your pets healthy life. i started feeding green cow to my 13 year old Golden 18 months ago. this is my 7th golden and number 8 will get tripe from the start. also it should be noted that she gets 45 minutes of hard exercise daily. dont let age slow your pet down. if you have an older large dog with hind leg and back arthritis you may want to try Pyhcox, I double the recommended dose. my observation is these 2 products have decreased my pets pain and stiffness increased her muscle mass and improved her daily life."
positive,20/9/21,"Since reading some horrid stories about how some pet foods are made (when meat by-products are listed among the ingredients, it is usually from questionable sources, gross at best, dangerous for the pet at worst), I have decided to look for a healthier option. I found Merrick cat food by chance and was impressed by the list of the ingredients they use (here are the ingredients for the flavor Grammy's Pot Pie, my cat's favorite):<br /><br />Chicken, Chicken Broth, Turkey Liver, Fresh Red Jacket New Potatoes, Fresh Carrots, Fresh Snow Peas, Fresh Whole Red Delicious Apples, Potato Starch-modified, Olive Oil, Calcium Carbonate, Potassium Chloride, Tricalcium Phosphate, Cassia Gum, Carrageenan, Flax Seed Oil (For Omega -3), Poultry Seasoning (Thyme, Sage, Rosemary) Choline Chloride, Salt, Taurine, Mixed Tocopherols, Vitamin E Supplement, Yucca Schidigera Extract, Zinc Amino Acid Complex, Iron Amino Acid Complex, Manganese Amino Acid Complex, Vitamin B12 Supplement, Copper Amino Acid Complex,d-Calcium Pantothenate, Vitamin A Acetate, Niacin, Lecithin, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Folic Acid, Ethylenediamine Dihydriodide, Cobalt Glucoheptanate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Biotin,Thiamine Mononitrate, Sodium Selenite.<br /><br />If you pay attention to the first ingredients, you will see that there are no meat by-products or grains, a cheap filler used by many companies that produce dog and cat food.<br /><br />My cat really likes this food. It comes in many other flavors, and she seems to enjoy pretty much all the ones I have offered her.<br />What also makes me like this food is that it does smell a lot better that any 'supermarket' pet food. The meat flavors smell like meat and the fish ones smell like fish, but in a disturbing, pungent way. Also you can see small pieces of vegetables with the meat, which my cat also likes and that are good for her.<br /><br />Sure, this food is a little more expensive than other products, but all in all it's well worth it. A must have -your cat will thank you!"
positive,13/10/21,Bought them for my daughters who I am trying to get them to eat healthier.  They enjoy the snack and will be buying more
positive,2/8/21,"I have ordered Eden organic pumpkin seeds consistently over the last 6 months.  I love them!  Always fresh, tasty and they are good for me(and you).<br />Part of my new diet regime....helped to get me back to my original college weight of 180 (not bad for a  6ft tall/55+ year old fellow)."
positive,11/6/21,"This company makes all their food with the highest, natural ingredients, but this ""limited ingredients"" one is the best. I learned that cats cannot digest carbohydrates. So, many cats have stomach problems and sensitive stomachs, like my kitty. I switched my cat over to this food and his stools are firmer and less<br />smelly and he NEVER throws up.  My cat gobbled up the food right away. I highly recommend this!"
positive,2/8/21,"Wow!  I actually picture the peanut butter cookie fresh out of the oven as this hits my tastebuds!  I was just looking for a gluten free meal replacement bar.  Lucky me, I found a delicious meal alternative that keeps me full for hours!"
positive,18/10/21,"This is the only type of treat my cat will eat!  I was so happy to find a large size because you can usually only buy the tiny containers in pet stores.  The 1 oz. is a better bargain.  My cat prefers this over Kitty Caviar, and it smells a lot fresher.  This is high quality healthy treat for any cat."
positive,23/7/21,"It smells a little funny, but tastes fine and I like it for its health benefits."
positive,8/7/21,"Delicious tuna that is low in mercury and line caught.  This is skipjack tuna, which is dark in color, low in mercury and has a sushi like taste.  Try it and you'll be hooked (pun intended)."
positive,11/6/21,"I had been looking for a healthier breakfast. This has worked great for me. I can add a variety of food items to this to add variety. I prepare a large quantity in a rice cooker and store it in the refrigerator. When it is time to eat, an amount can be dished up and various ingredients can be added. Chopped walnuts, blue berries, honey, cinamon, brown sugar, etc. Not all at once. Milk is added and then re-heated in the microwave. I think it makes a great healthy breakfast or any time meal."
positive,25/6/21,"This McCann's Irish Oatmeal is an ideal breakfast.  It is easy to cook and<br />taste good and heart healthy.  It's a good way to start a day.  The price is right and I would order again and agin.<br /><br />Cecilia from Texas"
positive,2/8/21,"These are extremely tasty! A nice sweet fresh taste. I felt like I was eating healthy candy. They're pretty crunchy, too, rather than chewey, which is a nice change from a lot of energy bars. (I'm getting sick of most kinds..)<br />This may be my new favorite. I wish Amazon had the 1.7oz 230 calorie bars that I got, they're a better size for taking on hikes and stuff!"
positive,11/6/21,"Don't be swayed by what some reviewers are saying about Annie's Natural Shells and Aged Cheddar Mac and Cheese. I almost didn't purchase this product because of some of the reviews I read on here, but I'm glad I did. It's not only healthy and fast, but actually pretty tasty too. If you're expecting something all natural that tastes like Kraft, you're going to be disappointed. Kraft's sauce is thicker and sweeter, but Annie's sauce tastes less processed and has a better all-around flavor. I prefer the Aged Cheddar Mac and Cheese to the White Cheddar one (which was very bland). Try adding a little extra butter to enhance the flavor of the sauce."
positive,9/7/21,"Eat. Think. Smile. Granola clusters Cinnamon almond is 12 ounces of good eating.  Healthy, yet delicious granola clusters with almonds and cinnamon get the extra treatment of cocoa powder!  This delicious coating adds antioxidants and taste.  Whole grains give these treats thumbs up for me.  But all these healthy elements do add up to 160 calories per 1/3 cup serving.<br /><br />Perfect for snacking right out of the bag, or I would eat them with milk or on top of yogurt.<br /><br />Although these are definitely vegetarian, I do not know if they are vegan; as the ingredient list includes sugar and honey.  The product's website did not disclose that it is in fact vegan, so I would assume not.<br /><br />I highly recommend this tasty, healthy snack!"
positive,22/6/21,"I adopted my adorable Edmund last year from a shelter. They sent me home with a small bag of Felidae (NOT grain free version) cat and kitten formula as he was a kitten at the time.<br />I am very concerned about eating healthy WHOLE foods, so I of course want the best for my kitty as well. I did research and found that cats' digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains/fruits/vegetables directly, and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey's stomachs (ie: if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it). So I wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what's found in nature as possible, without breaking the bank.<br />He already seemed to really like the Felidae Grain-included version, so as soon as my starter bag ran out I immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has ONLY eaten this ever since I got him - he LOVES it!<br />I give him one small scoop of this grain free kibble in the morning and then a quarter or so of a large 13oz Felidae grain free can of food (we've tried both the turkey/chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and Edmund prefers the turkey/chicken but will of course eat anything I give him :-)).<br /><br />He has the absolute SOFTEST, SHINIEST FUR COAT I have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy. I have to blame at least SOME of this on the fact he only eats grain free Felidae food (the rest is because I love him so ridiculously much!).<br /><br />I LOVE the FREE SHIPPING on Amazon (I buy a case of canned and a bag of dry (or 2 of one) at the same time)! I used to buy this elsewhere, and since it's so heavy shipping would often be almost as much as the product!"
positive,2/8/21,Very tasty and fiber-rich cereal.  I ate it cold with soy milk and finished the box off myself.  I am buying more!!!
positive,11/6/21,"I prefer this almond milk to any other. I enjoy the genuine, mild almond taste, and don't need nor want any sweeteners, vanilla flavors, or other unnecessary distractions. There is no bitterness with this milk like there is with some other major brands. Very tasty, and very healthy. Mere 50 calories per serving. Cruelty free too! I only take this almond milk; I used to buy it in my local store, but they discontinued it, and I like it so much that I now have to order it on Amazon."
positive,8/7/21,"This is one of my favorite healthy cereals.  It has a good mix of textures and the flavors are sweet and indulgent.  Eating it you definitely do not feel like you are eating a 'health nut' cereal.  I am a huge fan of banana so I really enjoy the distinguishable sweet and fruity flavor they lend the cereal as well as the slight nuttiness from the flax.  The green tea is really subtle (almost undetectable) and doesn't really affect the flavor of the cereal.<br /><br />The only downside is that this cereal is a little more calorically dense than some of the other healthy cereals on the market.  It is 190 calories for 3/4 cup with 6 grams of fiber and 10 grams of protein while<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E05G"">Kashi GOLEAN Cereal, 14.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> has only 14 calories, 10 grams of fiber, and 13 g of protein in a cup.  As a result, Optimum Rebound isn't as filling and I find myself feeling hungrier faster than I do if I've had Kashi GOLEAN for breakfast.  However, the flavor of Optimum Rebound is MUCH sweeter and more complex so understandably you have to sacrefice nutritionals a bit for something that is tastier.  However, it is still much healthier than many mainstream sugary cereals.  I find myself typically making up the difference by mixing some Optimum Rebound into my Kashi GOLEAN for flavor.  This gives me the best of both words.<br /><br />However, this is still a great cereal overall and will especially appeal to you if you find cereals like Kashi GOLEAN to be too bland."

positive,1/8/21,Great healthy breakfast option for both kids and adults!  My 2 yr old son loves all flavors and the ingredients are much healthier than the commercial brands. :)
positive,16/7/21,"This is an INCREDIBLE product. It's natural sweeteners make it so tasty! I can eat half the bag in one sitting and not feel bad! It's the perfect snack, with yogurt, milk, or frozen yogurt!!! Thank you BNF for making a tasty, health-conscious treat!"
positive,2/8/21,"I keep these in my desk drawer.  They are my quick breakfast and snack at any time of day.  They taste great, and have nothing but good stuff in them."
positive,11/6/21,"I like to eat these for breakfast or in between meals for a quick healthy snack. I like the almonds and flax included in these bars. The texture is really nice, a little chewy, but a little crunchy. There  is a good balance of complex carbs and proteins to give me enough energy to get to my next meal. These are not too sweet. There are no chemicals or artificial ingredients in these. Give them a try."

positive,11/6/21,"I love Glenny's Low Fat Soy Crisps.  They're delicious, healthy, and have protein.  They're a great snack, and I keep some in my car when I get hungry in the afternoon.  They're cheaper to buy in bulk online, because in the store you pay over a dollar per bag."
positive,22/10/21,"My Chocolate Lab, Lizzy is very active even at 9 years old. SHe does eat yogurt but will not eat any vegetables so this is a way for her to get some fruit. SHe really looks forward to these treats. They smell great. I keep them in a lagre glass container on the Kitchen counter and one time had a house guest mistake them for a cookie."
positive,6/8/21,"These cookies are absolutely amazing. My three year doesnt like a lot of snacks and cookies and hes very picky, but he likes a couple of these flavors. They are very soft and very delicious and extremely tasty, you almost forget that they are healthy for you. I absolutely love quaker oatmeal and these cookies are an extra treat."
positive,24/6/21,we go on a lot of road trips and i always make sure to pack quaker bars as the kids love them they are great taste good and so easy to pack highley reccommend these to anyone as a to go snack

positive,10/3/21,great tuna. Nice chunky texture. You can actually taste the tuna instead of the salt.
positive,17/4/21,This taffy is so good.  It is very soft and chewy.  The flavors are amazing.  I would definitely recommend you buying it.  Very satisfying!!
negative,21/1/21,I love eating them and they are good for watching TV and looking at movies! It is not too sweet. I like to transfer them to a zip lock baggie so they stay fresh so I can take my time eating them.

positive,13/2/21,"The variety packs taste great!<br /><br />I have them every morning. At $0.30 cents per meal, I don't understand why everyone on earth isn't buying this stuff up.<br /><br />Maple and brown sugar is terrific, followed by apples and cinnamon, followed by regular. You don't get tired of the same ole thing, and they taste great.<br /><br />I just boil water from a small pot, empty the packet or 2 in a bowl, pour in boiling water, and watch it expand to 2x its size!<br /><br />Taste really good and takes minutes to prepare.<br /><br />Not sure why everyone on earth isn't this. Convenient, healthy, very quick, excellent quality, and extremely cheap..."
positive,15/1/21,"We really like the McCann's steel cut oats but find we don't cook it up too often.<br />This tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenient.<br />Anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing."
negative,6/3/21,"I purchased the Mango flavor, and to me it doesn't take like Mango at all.  There is no hint of sweetness, and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice.  I've been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades, so I'm familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products I've tried.  The mango flavor is one of the least appealing I've tasted.  It's not terrible, but it's bad enough that I notice the bad taste every sip I take."
positive,8/6/21,These taste really good. I have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture. I agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer. There is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items. Order in cold weather and buy enough to last!!!
positive,7/1/21,"The mouth says, ""How do I love thee, let me count the ways...""<br />If you like apple products a must have item.  The only draw back, shipping cost.  These are very heavy."
positive,17/4/21,"I've been a fan of Hot & Spicy Maruchan Ramen for a long time. If you enjoy spice, and love ramen, you'll love this product. Too bad it's way too expensive here on Amazon. It's only $3.36 per 12 at my Walmart."
positive,10/3/21,"I love this flavor of ramen! I don't eat other flavors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison. For the convenience of having it delivered to my home (I have prime, so I get it in two days and don't have to pay for the shipping), the price on amazon isn't bad at all, but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store."
positive,14/1/21,"The BEST investment I've ever made for ginger. It's unbelievable! It's fibrous like the real ginger, has that spicy kick to it, but it's perfect with the sugar - calms it down.  It's very worth the $40 for 5lbs of it!  I'll be getting more soon - I use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies :)"
positive,24/5/21,"Perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket.  We love it. Shakes well, no clumping and flows freely."
positive,14/10/21,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:26 Mins<br /><br /></span>The expiration date is 21 months from the day I bought this product. The tuna, tomato combination is delicious. This is one of the many items I re-order on Amazon every month or so.<br />edit: added a short video, so you see what this combination looks like.<br /><br />I was wearing one of those headlamps, but I didn't do a good job focusing on the tuna.<br />I should film it over, but it doesn't look like many people view this product anyway."
positive,7/2/21,"these are the best tasting tuna pack they make in my opinion - make a great on the go snack, and really satisfying with the tomato"
positive,29/3/21,"I found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there. Excellent quality, and no need to 'dress it up'.<br /><br />I put it the micro on about 20% power for 1 minute and Shazam!<br /><br />I believe a little heating brings out the flavor."
negative,17/4/21,Seriously this product was as tasteless as they come. There are much better tasting products out there but at 100 calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack. You just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor.
positive,10/3/21,"Tastes great, and gives me energy without the jitters. Love this product.<br />However, I do wish it came in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a zip-lock pouch because the zip-lock ripped off and quit working after awhile. But the product is fantastic, just not crazy about the packaging."
positive,10/7/21,These mints are really strong and have a great taste. They are also a convenient size to carry in a pocket or purse.
positive,27/1/21,"I'm trying several of the Wu Yi teas. I like this one particularly because of the subtle citrus taste. It also has a natural sweetness.<br /><br />The ingredients include Organic Wu-Li Cliff Oolong Tea (700 mg), Organic Black Tea (600 mg), Organic Green Tea Extract (100 mg), Proprietary blend (600 mg), plus some Ginseng (panax), Orange Peel, Lemon Grass, and Guarana. Other Ingredients: Natual Orange and Citrus flavors.<br /><br />My goal is to drink more tea and less coffee. I am enjoying trying a different kind of tea every day. I'll be coming back to this one."
negative,1/6/21,"Terrible! Artificial lemon taste, like Pledge Lemon Furniture Polish. Don't do this to yourself. Just use plain flake salt and some fresh grated lemon zest."
negative,20/8/21,"The taste of these white cheddar flat breads is like a regular cracker - which is not bad, except that I bought them because I wanted a cheese taste.<br /><br />What was a HUGE disappointment? How misleading the packaging of the box is. The photo on the box (I bought these in store) makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads (expanding the length and width of the box). Wrong! The plastic tray that holds the crackers is about 2"" smaller all around - leaving you with about 15 or so small flatbreads.<br /><br />What is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and eco-friendly packaging. FAIL! They used a HUGE box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers. Not ecofriendly at all.<br /><br />Would I buy these again? No - I feel ripped off. The other crackers (like Sesame Tarragon) give you a little<br />more bang for your buck and have more flavor."
positive,14/8/21,"A very delicate green tea with a smooth light taste and an subtle floral tones and no bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />In the 20+ years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed. The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years.<br /><br />I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here (thanks Amazon!) because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away. The current deal for the pack of 6 is superb (much cheaper than I can find locally).<br /><br />This is a great tasting tea, which I am happy to recommend."
positive,21/4/21,"So many ""healthy"" products don't taste very good.  Or taste good when you first try them and then go downhill.  I've had these chips on more than one occasion and they are very tasty.  I've served them to guests twice and both times they wanted to know what they were and where to get them. It's also nice to have something gluten-free for friends who are borderline diabetic...but I would eat them anyway."
negative,1/4/21,"I paid $1.79 for a 2 ounce pkg of these at lunch today. I bought them because brown rice is a ""good"" carb.  As soon as I tasted one and it tasted like a corn chip I checked the ingredients.  The name is deceptive - these have ""Masa corn flour"" listed in the ingredients and it overwhelms the taste.  I won't buy these again - I can get Sunchips for less money and similar taste."
positive,17/4/21,"I was looking for a natural energy shot that works, and I found it. Steaz energy shot is my favorite!<br /><br />I recently had gastric bypass surgery, so tons of sugar is a no-no. And I'm also allergic to Sucralose (Splenda) so most other energy drinks are out.<br /><br />I tried Bazi energy shots and they didn't work as well as Steaz, and definitely didn't taste as well. These have a taste that's almost like Coca-Cola--not bad at all.<br /><br />If you're looking for natural energy, give these a try."
positive,10/3/21,"I first found Steaz Berry Energy Shots at a local organic market. I bought two bottles, which cost just under three dollars each. I fell in love instantly. The drink is delicious -- I can taste the yerba mate and the acai juice, like a slightly bitter fruity chocolate honey tea. I am very sensitive to sucralose (Splenda) which is in so many energy drinks these days; I also hate the taste. I love that Steaz has actual sugar and no artificial sweeteners. The rush it gives me is slow and even. I have several medical conditions, including fibromyalgia, which saps me of energy and causes intense pain. I like how Steaz helps clear away the fatigue and fog so I can get things done. No caffeine jitters, even though there are 150 mg of caffeine in each bottle.<br />It was becoming expensive for me to buy the bottles separately at stores, so I started looking online for a bulk price. I am so thrilled to have found the Pack Of 12 on Amazon. I signed up for Amazon Prime specifically for this product, hah!"
positive,22/4/21,"I love this coffee. I do wish it came already ground as I don't have a grinder and use a blender instead. But it's worth it. Many flavored coffees I've tried only seem to have a flavored odor that doesn't reach the coffee, but this one manages both."
positive,25/4/21,"I like a lot of sesame oil and use it in salads regularly.  Great quality, flavor and aroma.  Can't beat that its organic!"
positive,1/4/21,This is what I was looking for and was missing it. The taste is exactly the taste as the one made in India so just loved it and remember my days back in India. Definitely recommend it.
positive,30/6/21,"I bought this strawberry extract hoping to spruce up a strawberry wine that ended up with less flavor than I'd original expected. (A common problem in some fruit wines.)<br /><br />This is, indeed, good strawberry flavor!  Just add to your sugary concoction (be it a baking good, a dessert or a drink) to either give strawberry flavor (or add to existing flavor), and presto, just about everyone will be licking their lips (and maybe fingers).<br /><br />For those interested, I found the right addition to a liquid volume to be 4 oz of extract per 1 gallon of liquid."
positive,1/3/21,"This is just Fantastic Chicken Noodle soup, the best I have ever eaten, with large hearty chunks of chicken,and vegetables and nice large noodles. This soup is just so full bodied, and is seasoned just right.  I am so glad Amazon carries this product.  I just can't find it here in Vermont."
positive,29/1/21,These nuts arrived fresh and are very tasty.  They are not broken or dirty looking like cashews sometimes can.
positive,17/4/21,"I was surprised about how good this was my family and friends laughed when I told them I bought this. But out of the can ready mix with a little salt, pepper, spinach, and some cheese and it's a great easy meal!"
positive,10/3/21,"The thing about Marmite is that those who don't like it hate it, and those who love it can't live without it.  It's very much ""an English thing"" and the language has even adopted the trade name as a metaphor (as in ""Victoria Beckham is Marmite"" meaning that those who don't like her...etc.).  Amazon has done the world a favor by making this weird and wonderful stuff available at an affordable price.  Last time I looked, it was $25 a 500g jar in British stores in L.A.County, or about 4x what it costs in England.  The Amazon supplier was quick and efficient, and I now have enough Marmite to last me to the end of the year (or would have, if I didn't decide to send one of the two jars to my son in Japan!).  Good job, Amazon!"
positive,30/5/21,"one of the best chips that you can buy...and i've tried all the kettle varieties, and many others.  There's only a slight taste of jalapeno, and they are delicious. Perfect with a sandwich or alone.<br />If you like being addicted, these are the chip for you. ...See you at addicts anonymous..."
positive,28/9/21,"These chips have the right amount of crunch and I enjoy the taste. Chips are consistent and have a fairly even distribution of seasoning. I like the 2-oz size bags, just the right amount of chips."

positive,20/4/21,fantastic!you can not beat this taste and you can not resist to it only one if you are spice lover
positive,20/4/21,"I simply fell in love with these chips and refused to share them with my friends.  :))  My experience with a lot of cheese-favored chips has been too salty and a little over the greasy side.  But these NY Cheddar from Kettle really changed my mind.  Thanks to Amazon for great discounts and I don't have to buy them from the store anymore."
positive,21/4/21,"Great price for an excellent chip. At about 80 cents for a 2 ounce bag these are a bargain as well as a very tasty chip. Everyone I've let try these has been impressed and commented on how good they taste. I've yet to find a Kettle chip that disappointed!"
negative,2/5/21,"I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy.  I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.""  I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand¬Æ Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.<br />We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand¬Æ flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.<br />Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.""  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same..."
positive,18/12/19,"I'd continue to buy but I'm moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars...shattered too many. They like all the flavors though. Great textures too."
positive,19/1/20,Sent this basket to my father for his birthday.  He said the fruit was very fresh and sweet.  Happy with this healthy purchase!
positive,19/1/20,I ordered this on-line and received it in just a few days (3).  The tea is excellent and the price was right for  me.
positive,31/3/20,"I heard some great things about Sassafras and wanted to try it.  I was worried about the taste but it turned out to be a lot better than i anticipated.  I'm actually gonna order the 4-pack and continue drinking it over time.  Don't trust the FDA!!"
negative,18/12/19,"I purchased this because I read that it was a natural cure for hives..Um, how about NOT.  It did nothing for my hives and it tastes awful.  Luckily, a co-worker of mine loves this stuff (reminds him of his grandmother) and I gave it to him.  Yucky, yucky stuff."
positive,13/10/19,"These are great for at work, just pop the instant bag in for a minute then make your coffee. This is the best tasting coffee. It's easy to make without a mess."
positive,28/9/20,"I tried this before having normal red tea so I waited to review. The flavor still rings in my head it is earthier than rooibos tea and less frity. The color is that of muddy water, and it has the grittiness and viscosity of it as well. Well worth every penny."
positive,16/11/20,My poland spring driver gave us this new tea to try and<br />our family really enjoyed it. I looked at the ingredients and was quite pleased<br />with the natural ingredients and no calories.
positive,27/2/20,This is my favorite hot sauce. I buy it locally and love the flavor that they all have. Hopefully the other flavors will show up on amazon for people to enjoy! My favorites are the medium and pineapple flavored ones so far. Thank you for making a flavorful hot sauce!
positive,26/2/21,"This is the first time I've used the coconut oil from Manila Coco Factory and I was so pleased with the taste, smell and overall incredible quality that I will buy more and recommend it to my family and friends.  I am so glad I tried it. I have been using coconut oil for several years and it has changed my life and health.  This oil ranks high in my book. Also, I liked ordering this product through amazon because they make it fast, easy and painless. Thank you for having this product on your site Amazon."
positive,18/12/19,"These are identical to ""Jay's hot chips"" (are they made by the same company?).  They have a slightly sweet taste, with a nice bit of heat. Definately not overwhelming heat, on a heat scale of 1-5, I would give these about a 2.  Regarding the texture, these are not kettle cooked chips, so they do not have much crunch, they are comparable to regular Lays chips.  For about $1 a bag, they are a great deal."
positive,19/1/20,"I first had these Uncle Ray's chips a few years ago while traveling out west. I tracked them down on Amazon and recognized the name. They are just as good as I remember: smoky sweet with just enough kick, and there's adequate seasoning on all of the chips. Each bag also has a little story, courtesy of Uncle Ray, that usually has some moral message or anecdote. They are pretty funny, but not intentionally. My only problem with these chips is their texture. They're a bit thin, and there's not much of a crunchy texture. Otherwise, these are good chips and well worth trying out."
negative,13/9/20,"We have ordered Uncle Rays BBQ chips many times before. Always been pleased, except this order!  Just NOT the same<br />Seasoning as usual. Generally lacked much for taste! Not sure if they have reduced the seasoning, in their processing? But out of case we bought, we have opened and thrown away 3 bags already, VERY disappointed with this order!"
negative,10/7/20,"I have loved ketchup flavored potato chips since I was a kid and spent my summers at my grandparents in Canada. This is a very popular flavor there and seems to be always available. I recently got back from a trip to Montreal, where I ate at least a pack a day. I decided I really wanted some around and was happy when I found these on Amazon. Unfortunately, the flavor is nowhere close to the brands I've tried before. There's a sort of smoky, barbeque sauce thing going on. Not that they're as good as BBQ potato chips (which I love), they just don't taste like ketchup. I tried to get through a bag over a couple of weeks to see if they would grow on me, then just threw them all out. Yuck!"
positive,14/4/21,"If you're looking at Choice tea, you're probably already aware that this extraordinary company was a pioneer in the use of organic, fair trade ingredients for tea.<br /><br />But Choice is also innovative both in design and in creative ingredient combinations. As for design, Lychee White is part of Choice's new line, characterized by an innovative biodegradable pyramid-shaped tea bag which allows for the use of regular loose tea leaves. As for creative ingredient combinations, this healthy white tea is enhanced by the ethereal marriage of natural lychee flavor and sublime organic osmanthus blossoms. The flavor and scent is one to savor and celebrate."
positive,24/4/21,"I prefer the taste of this over the alcohol-based vanilla extracts, particularly in uncooked items and beverages. It has a fairly thick/syrupy consistency."
positive,28/4/21,"Raw, Organic, Fair Trade, Tastes Great... What's not to love? My hope is that as more people buy their amazing chocolates that the price will come down a bit."
positive,12/7/21,"Being the candy-lover that I am, I wanted to buy some cute lollipops that I could pull out of my bag and enjoy whenever I felt like it. For that purpose alone, I'd give them five stars. However- at first lick, the lollipop has a slightly off taste; but this goes away after a minute and is not unbearable or disgusting in any way. I laughed quite a bit at the reviews of outraged individuals because the lollipops are 'Made in China'- I'm not dead/dying/sick. Good enough? As well, the text on the wrapper is fine- I wasn't repulsed by it and I'm not afraid to share. I'd only rewrap them if they were for presentation rather than eating.<br />The colors are not as vivid as in the picture, and the lolipops are not glazed- so they do not have that shiny look that many others have. None of mine came broken, and they were well-wrapped. I'm happy with my purchase and plan on eating them all(minus the few that I share with friends), but I'd try something different next time."
positive,18/12/19,"I was surprised at the size of these potatoes. I have bought them at my local grocery store before and was disappointed that they were so small. These are perfect!! Tasty, cook just right. Love 'em!!"
positive,19/1/20,"Excellent and tasty though I thought not enough garlic so I added more. When I order GARLIC I guess I expect more of it.  But perfect if you have guests as it will never offend anyone. Omaha always is sure to do everything to please their customers, a premier company, hard to find anymore."
positive,28/4/21,I like em but nothing unique about the flavor.  basically saves you from having to make them at home... a little pricey but for a treat what the heck
positive,8/8/20,This tea is so helpful for congestion and it tastes great too.  Make sure you let it steep as long as the directions say.  It really seems to help you to feel better.
negative,22/5/21,"I bought this for my husband since he loves Ranch. He uses ranch dressing with everything. Before I bought it, I read a review that said it taste good inspite of the fat-free... Well, my husband had it and says it's aweful. I guess ""to each his own"" everyone's tastebuds are not alike.  Someone else may like it, so I am not going to discourage anyone from trying it. However, I had to cancel my subscription because the only one that likes Ranch in the family, doesn't like this one. I guess he needs the fat:)"
positive,18/12/19,I love these Wild Cherry Tic Tacs and they are impossible to find in stores.  I am so glad that I can get them from Amazon and the price is excellent!  They are a great low calorie treat and I will keep buying them from Amazon.  Highly recommend this purchase!
positive,19/1/20,"I have recently been on a low carb diet, as I find that I can no longer tolerate even natural sugars like agave, honey, and dates. These raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin, a hormone whose message is ""store fat!"" Insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore I would bloat from a high carb diet.<br /><br />My dilemma is that I love sweets--and now it is not a problem, thanks to products like stevia, a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years. It has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar (although for some people there might be a bit, as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar). Stevia used to be legal in the USA only as a cosmetic product because of politics: companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition. Yet, aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis. So I would use stevia at times, but the aftertaste was bad--and to be honest, I wasn't too crazy about the ""during taste"" either.<br /><br />Then I tried NuNaturals. This product is awesome and like no other stevia I have tried. It is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste (unless you put in way too much--a common mistake by people new to this). It comes in tablets and in powdered form (in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings). It also comes in alcohol-free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor. Unlike aspartame (which becomes even more toxic when heated) stevia can be used in baking. NuNaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that. (Since I am a raw fooder, I can't tell you how it tastes, but I am sure it is good, judging by their other products.)<br /><br />Thanks to these great products, I can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets!"
positive,3/8/20,"This is the best tasting stevia powder I've tried. Most other powders have a weird after taste but this one doesn't. I recently bought a 5lb bag of it online and I'm making my way through it."
positive,29/7/21,This has been the best tasting Stevia I have tried.  I also think this is a better value than some of the others.  I really like not having to open all the packets when I make a gallon of Tea.
positive,8/7/20,"I bought the NuNaturals White Stevia with Maltodextrin several months ago as I'm trying to cut back on sugar and artificial sweeteners. The first morning I tried it in my coffee and hated it. It tastes just as bitter as Equal or Sweet n Low. I decided to give it another  try that same day in my lemonade and it was absolutely delicious. I've also tried it in hot tea and it is bitter but wonderful in iced tea. So, I think hot drinks bring out the bitterness in stevia. All in all I'm glad I bought this and also a box of the packets which are very convenient on the go. I have tried many different brands of stevia but, so far this is the only one I have not thrown out. I also tried Truvia. Not a fan. It makes your coffee or tea taste like licorice!"
positive,13/4/21,"If you are trying to get off sugar, this is the product for you. I has a great sweet taste without spiking your insulin, and no bitter aftertaste.  Great for diabetics and anyone trying to eat healthy.  I love this product."
positive,20/2/21,"I have tried various brands of stevia, but I always come back to NuNaturals.  I buy the 12 ounce container because I use it to sweeten everything.  If you have a sweet tooth as I do but don't need the added pounds, then this is the ticket for you.  I drink a lot of tea, and this is my sweetener.  A lot of other stevia brands leave a bitter after taste, but this is the best that I have found to resolve that problem.  Highly recommended."
positive,9/12/20,"I was looking for a healthier alternative to Splenda and Equal, NuStevia taste great and this container lasts a long time."
positive,1/4/21,"I discovered this product a couple of years ago and really liked the taste in coffee , tea and on fruit and oatmeal.  It was a lot less expensive in the packets then, but I've switched to the large 12 oz. container and the price is very good. I don't use sugar and this helps me have the ""sweet"" and not the increased blood sugar-YEAH!!"
positive,25/2/21,"Love this on a toasted bagel with cream cheese and scallions or even dill, great way to enjoy caviar and not break the bank."
negative,18/12/19,"This stuff sounded perfect...way too much red dye and no taste according to me and my 3 friends who tried it...kind of salty.  Basically, I would stay away from it.  I am tempted to toss it out, but paid too much to feel right about it..."
positive,19/1/20,"Forget Starbucks, Peets or anything else. This is the real deal. Like a good vintage wine, Britt coffee is truly gourmet with no after taste! I am really fussy about coffee, and generally avoid it, but after a trip to Costa Rica fell in love with the beverage again! You have to use a French Press to get the full favor so throw away those other coffee making contraptions, your beans deserve the best, your taste buds deserve the best too. No I don't work for Britt and did not get paid to say this!!!!!  But if you guys at Britt read this send me a sample or two!!"
positive,14/10/20,"Great tasting coffiee!! One of the best I've ever had! The problem here is the high shipping costs."
positive,10/3/21,"These radiation-treated dinners that don't need freezing are a great convenience.  I've tried quite a few of the Hormel Compleats and this is one of my favorites.  Home cookin', it ain't, and it's a bit too salty, but for a satisfying meal in 90 seconds, it's hard to beat.  The only reason I've given this flavorful, decently chicken-filled dish 4 stars instead of 5 is because the rice is white.  We all know by now that whole grains are healthier, so, until these companies start making their dishes with whole wheat pasta and brown rice, I'll mark them down."
positive,15/8/21,"If you want a hot meal with no effort that is delious...this is the way. While cooking noodles...microwave left over meat/hot dog/boloni(sp?). Also, microwave a spoon or two of vegetable...left over/frozen/canned. After noodles cook/add season packet...pour over meat/veg...after a minute pour some of the liquid out...you have a wonderful meal with less sodium because you poured it out! College kids live off this meal because it is CHEAP/quick and can all be done in microwave if need be. You can get a case of Libby's carot/peas from AMAZON for about$11! Since you are using only a spoon or two...lasts a long time!"
positive,27/4/21,"Sure, I could have gone on a food crusade at the local grocery to find a similar product. But I don't think I would have found a product as good and tasty as Dr. McDougall. The noodles are quick and easy to prepare and above all else tasty enough to satisfy my appetite. I was surprised that there were enough peanuts in every bite just like at a Thai food restaurant. Overall, I'm pleased with my order and the quality of the product."
positive,24/1/21,"These jelly beans are wonderful.  They are smaller than regular jelly beans but that doesn't take away the flavor.  I would recommand these to anyone."
positive,14/7/20,"Just a quick note... a very good friend of mine who also battles weight issues and love pasta turned me on to this product.  We bought a box at Whole Foods and I was impressed by the taste but especially by the low calories and high fiber content.  Amazingly it's about 40% cheaper at Amazon than at Whole Foods, and being an Amazon Prime customer saved me on shipping.<br />I'll be back for more soon.  I love quality and a bargain."
positive,5/6/21,I am on a low carb diet and have lost 25 pounds.  I was so tired of eating meat all the time but too nervous to splurge on pasta until I came across this product on Amazon.  I cook it a minute or two longer than the directions and top it with full fat Greek yogurt and parm cheese and one serving is so filling and yummy.  Definitely cures my cravings and am now on subscribe and save.  My hubby and son love it too!
positive,9/7/21,So many different flavors to choose from.  I ordered this brand for the first time and the taste is wonderful.  It was the only decaf french vanilla I could find.  I have decided to switch from my old brand to this one.
positive,5/6/21,"Provided you use clean (preferably purified) water to cook this, it can be a great tasting hold over to a main meal. Far superior to most instant noodle packages out there and for the most part, gluten and meat free (except for the shrimp flavor).<br /><br />While some people have remarked on the ""over-sized"" packaging, this actually allows for a good and thorough mixing of the flavor packets and noodles with little chance of spillage.<br /><br />While the coconut ginger variety tastes good, it may be a bit too subtle for those looking for an actual ""taste of THAI."" I'd recommend the Thai Peanut noodles for those seeking something with a bit more of a pronounced Thai flavor and highly recommend The A Taste Of Thai Peanut Salad Dressing (added to salads, meats or the Peanut Noodles) for a very spicy Thai experience.<br /><br />Overall for the taste and quantity, the subscribe and save offer provides the best deal. Comparatively speaking in terms of price, Wal-Mart offers most of these noodles a few cents cheaper (compared to the subscription price) but do not seem to carry the Coconut Ginger Variety. At least not at the store near me.<br /><br />If you haven't tried this brand of instant noodles yet, I think you'll be in for a treat."
positive,25/7/21,"I really like this soup.  It is mild and I don't like anything that is to hot.  IT is just right.  Has a good flavor and is something I can take to work and pop in the microwave. I would buy it again and again."
positive,13/7/21,The Thai Coconut Ginger Noodles are quick and easy to prepare. You will be rewarded with delicious noodles to enjoy by yourself or share as a side dish with another noodle enjoyer.
negative,9/7/21,"I tried these as I love Thai food, ginger and coconut. That was my problem, as this mess does not even vaguely resemble Thai food and has no discernible ginger or coconut taste. Plus, the noodles stick together, even when prepared as suggested, and come out in a big clump when you try to eat them.<br /><br />Also, the nutrition label is misleading. I am dieting and read labels very carefully. This says a serving is one cup and also says one package weighs 4oz (half a cup). I figured, as it did not say otherwise and as this type of meal is usually one serving, that after adding water there would be one serving per package. Not so, one package is actually two servings, or over 500 calories. This is far more than any other pre-packaged noodle meal I have seen.<br /><br />The excessive calorie content might have been OK had the product tasted good, but it doesn't. I would definitely recommend you stay away from this mess."
positive,8/7/21,"While the restaurants always do it best, these curry pastes are pretty tasty. It's easy to use,  fast, and you can add the meat and veggies of your choice. For those of you scared of something spicy, you might use a little less, but for most, it's just right, and for those that like it spicier, you can add a little crushed red pepper. Since the coconut milk has to be added separately, you can also control the fat content--you can go light or go with the much yummier, creamy stuff. I find the green curry is a little sweeter than the red and panang curries, and is maybe a little less spicy."
positive,15/7/21,"I just ordered this, came today and thought I would just try it, well to my amazement,My little Daisy ate it and wanted more.My little Dog is just 8 yrs but has trouble with Flare-ups with her pancreas, I have to avoid fats and corn with her and she needs more fiber. I have been making her dog food ,but she missed eating the dry,I wondered if it was small enough for her to chew , but it was."
positive,6/7/21,"Everyone should know this is a healthier dog food than walmart brands, like purina, iams, or god forbid moist & meaty. Ingredients like ground flax seed, peas, whole carrots, whole sweet potatoes, apples, blueberries and probiotics and the lack of sweeteners, by-products, and low-quality corn show this to be true.<br /><br />I just did a taste test with this harmonic farms and my dogs old iams ProActive Health and decided to make the results known. I let him smell both thoroughly without letting him eat at first, and placed the two piles a bit apart. He immediately went for the harmonic farms, finished it and didn't even look at the iams before coming back to me wagging his tail hoping for more.<br /><br />Dogadvisor.com made me aware of my past mistakes in dog food choices and I was hoping to god he would not shy away from the healthy organic stuff like I do. To my great welcome surprise, he didn't! I guess he's a hippie at heart. I on the other hand, will take my nachos bell grande."
positive,13/8/21,"These tastes good. If it's not fried, not bad for you, and tastes good, then why not eat them? Of course, not a lot at once, but these are great healthier snacks."
positive,5/6/21,"A while ago I got a bag of the BBQ at a store to go with my lunch and I loved these so when I was searching amazon and found these on subscribe and save I knew that this was something that I had to have for my lunches. I love the fact you get all the different flavors and as of yet I have not found a flavor I did not like. Being from England I am very picky about my flavors of chips or crisps as I would call them as there seems to be such limited flavors but this box gives me flavors I can't complain. I also love the fact that 5% fat is the fat content which just makes them an even better snack. My only issue now is that I have to fight my husband and son over them because they love them just as much as I do. I have now had to go to a box a month but even then I am not sure I can have enough for the month with the three of us eating them every chance we can."
positive,9/7/21,"Good flavorful chips - too bad the selection does not include jalape&ntilde;o or paramsan garlic. Packaging is difficult to open, but they fresh."
positive,17/6/21,"These are really good tasting chips, they aren't too unhealthy so you can eat a fair amount. Love the flavoring."
positive,31/8/21,These really are good I gave some to other people and they liked them too. The plain flavored ones take well to using them as scoops for your own dip or salsa. When eating the BBq flavored ones brings back memories of yester years when I would eat BBq pork skins while riding in the back of the truck on the range. I think the pepper ones could use more pepper but they are all still good and make a good snack or side dish to lunch at 100 Cal per pack.
positive,7/8/21,"I bought these when they were on a Gold Box deal...thinking that it would be a nice inexpensive toss in for a month of lunches...and then I'd never buy them again.<br /><br />Not so...<br /><br />They're actually really tasty!  Exceptionally crunchy!  And the flavor is similar to kettle cooked chips.  Definitely going on subscribe and save for a while.<br /><br />I don't think they're any more salty than standard potato chips...but they're by no means ""low salt."""
positive,6/9/21,"Popchips don't taste like a lot of the other lowfat salty snack options.  They are light in taste and big on crunch.  Great alternative to potato chips.  I'm not a fan of the BBQ flavor but I do like the sea salt & vinegar, salt & pepper alot and sour cream and onion.  Like the individual bags - perfect for on the go and lunches."
positive,5/6/21,"These are better than any low calorie chips I've ever had, and I prefer them to normal chips. They are wonderful. Oprah even loves them.  I would buy this box again, and probably will, because I LOVE that these are 100 calorie packs. The barbeque and salt and vinegar ones are AWESOME."
positive,9/7/21,These taste wonderful!  Guilt free if you can stop at one bag.  Will definitly buy again!
positive,19/6/21,"What's to say - Pop Chips are great!!!  Kudos to the PoP Chip makers."
positive,5/9/21,"I really liked these chips.<br /><br />They came recommended from my friend and I really like them. The variety pack is great to try all of the flavors - although there were some I wasn't so fond of.<br /><br />The cheddar, bbq, and salt/pepper chips are great. The traditional ones are get this.... traditional. No excitement there.<br /><br />The chips are great - my brother still asks if I have any around the house but I haven't yet purchased them again.<br /><br />Hint: the have the texture of the snack Munchos."
positive,10/10/21,"I love popchips, The bag now has only 100 calories. and it bit smaller but If you are craving pop chips without the fat and still taste great. These are for you. A bit pricey but worth it."
negative,29/9/21,"I've heard about these chips for a while now and thought they would be a good alternative to regular chips. I couldn't eat them though, they just don't taste good to me personally. My grandmother loved them though and I gave the rest to her."
positive,11/9/21,"We love Popchips, but they're hard to find at our local grocery stores. I was very excited to find this variety pack, which has 6 flavors (some of which we'd never tried before) in single-serve packages right around 100 calories a piece. Our favorites were the original, sea salt & vinegar, and sour cream & onion... but all of the flavors were good. These were perfect for snacks, but they also made for easy lunches. We'll definitely order again!"
negative,5/6/21,"I love Amazon and I love the reviews from people, I've been introduced to alot of great products b/c of the reviews, but this time? Total, complete LET DOWN! Popchips having 4.5 stars is just down right perplexing!?! The should not get more than a 3, but generally 1-2. I sorta want to give it a 1, but the packaging is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing so I through in the extra point.<br /><br />I ordered these thinking that'd they'd be maybe a slightly better version of Baked Lays. Man was I wrong... I've tried most of the Baked Lays flavors, my go-to's at first were 1.) original baked lays and 2.) sour cream baked lays (since those are my favorite regular lays). But then  I discovered BBQ Baked Lays. And seriously, those are FANTASTICALLY great. BBQ Baked Lays are packed with SO much flavor.<br /><br />These Popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips. Literally they do. Because they aren't as good as Baked Lays I can definitely see eating much less of them (which could be a benefit), but I say just use portion control-- and zip lock bag a bunch of Baked Lays.<br /><br />I'm trying to think of ways to go into more detail, but there's really not much more I can say.<br /><br />****SUMMARY****<br /><br />How do Popchips taste? Like slightly burnt air chips. (it's sort of a weird taste, takes ALOT of getting used to)<br /><br />Would I suggest buying them? No. If you're eager to try them, I say buy a bag from your local grocery store. A week or so after I ordered these on here I saw them at m local Krogers, so they're definitely expanding.<br /><br />Nutrition Information: 1 bag (.8 oz/ 23g) = 100 calories, Total Fat = 3g (5%), Sodium = 210 mg (9%), Total Carbohydrate = 16g (5%), Dietary Fiber = 1 g (4%), Sugar = 2g, Protein 1 g, Vitamin A , Vitamin C, Calcium, and Iron = 2 %.<br /><br />If you buy a big bag of BBQ Popchips and big bag of BBQ Baked Lays, here are the nutrition information side-by-side:<br /><br />**POP CHIPS:**<br />Serving Size: 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories= 120, Total Fat = 4.5g (6%), Sodium 280mg (11%), Total Carbohydrate 20g (6%),<br />Dietary Fiber 1g (4%), Sugars 2g, Protein 1g<br /><br />**BAKED LAYS:**<br />Serving Size= 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories = 120, Total Fat 3g (5%),  Sodium 210mg (9%), Potassium 230mg, Total Carbohydrate 22g (7%), Dietary Fiber 2g 8%, Sugars 3g, Protein 2g, Vitamin C 4%, Calcium 2%<br /><br />So these two are very close, but Baked Lays wins because it virtually has not sodium, since potassium 230mg offsets the Sodium 210mg, leaving 20g of Potassium. Plus there's more Fiber and more Vitamin C. And most importantly they taste better.<br /><br />I for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that Baked Lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit.<br /><br />At the end of the day make a decision for yourself, but I'd strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first. Maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both Baked Lays and Popchips... I can almost guarantee you that Baked Lays will win hands down.<br /><br />(Hopefully Amazon starts selling well-priced variety single-serve bags of Baked Lays soon. For now I found one from a seller, but the price seems a little high (but there are 40 bags instead of 20): <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TVDHIO"">Smart Mix Variety Pack, 30-Count: 7-Baked Lay's Classic, 6-Baked Cheetos, 6-Baked Ruffles, 6-Baked Doritos Nachos Cheese & 5-Rold Gold Tiny Twists (Pack of 2)</a> )"
negative,9/7/21,"These chips taste average and they are insanely expensive compare to the big bags of chips from safeway or costco, for $2, you can get a big bag with 10 times the amount of chips compare to these 0.8oz bag chips, so for $5 in safeway, you can get $30 worth of popchips, these bags are so tiny, it's like serve size for fat people trying to lose weigh or something, for me, i never gain weigh, i rather go buy big bag of chips, these are expensive ripoff chips, will never buy again.<br />Maybe i think the price is high because i bought it from amazon.com, maybe elsewhere is cheaper, but chips as junk food, shouldn't be that expensive compare to local stores."
positive,26/8/21,"These are great because they're only 100 calories per pack and are just as good, if not better, than other chips out there.<br /><br />The ""Original"" style taste exactly like Munchos, but don't come with the high calorie count.  The other flavors (Sour Cream & Onion, Salt & Vinegar, Salt & Pepper, Cheddar, and BBQ) are all delicious, as well."
positive,26/7/21,"I am potato chip-addicted. I don't only enjoy potato chips, but I also enjoy any type of potato product. This product really hit the mark for me.<br /><br />I consider these a full-fledged snack. Each bag is packed with chips. They are moderately seasoned, and full of flavor. The consistency is slightly like a popcorn cake -- but they're crisp and crunchy, not puffy. They have a distinct potato taste.<br /><br />The best part? Each bag clocks in at only 100 calories! And I repeat -- these are not a simple ""100 calorie"" snack. What you get here is a full bag of chips. What's great about the content vs. calorie content is that these are perfect to accompany your lunch without feeling guilty about eating a 200-300 calorie bag of chips.<br /><br />My personal favorites were the Sea Salt and Vinegar and the Original. The barbecue flavor is sweet, not smoky. The Salt and Pepper, Cheddar, and Sour Cream and Onion flavors are standard fair. But the chips are adequately and evenly seasoned and I did not notice differences in seasoning from one chip to the next.<br /><br />These are a great product, well manufactured, and a treat to eat. I'll definitely buy more of these in the future."
positive,11/9/21,"This doesn't taste as addicting as the real fried potato chips, but it's still very good.<br />Considering it's low in calories and it's only popped..  it taste much better than the ones that are freeze dried.<br />These pops taste as light as the rice crispy treats, but with a good amount of flavor and crunch.<br />I like it, a small little pack that you can just grab when you feel like having something quick.<br />I keep then in my room in case if I ever get the cravings for chips.<br />All the flavors that come in are good too, no complains.<br /><br />The package also arrived fast and it's pretty cheap, I would recommend people who is watching calories to get this!"
positive,11/9/21,"I love Popchips. They may take some time getting used to if you're used to the oiliness of potato chips, but they're only 100 calories per bag. Buying a 24 pack saves you money per bag, but you're sooo tempted to eat them with so many bags around!"
positive,15/9/21,"I'm very picky when it comes to chips. I've gone through so many, but this one really hits the spot. It has just the right amount of crunch, with just the right amount of flavor. It's also great to know that you're not eating something that's bad for you. With 100 calories a pack, it's definitely the ideal snack!"
positive,5/6/21,I have subscribed these chips. They are so tasty. Not dry or oily. Cannot put it down once open a bag and have to have two bags in a row.
negative,9/7/21,This product was a complete disappointment. Tastes like mushy pineapple. There was no papaya taste.
positive,14/9/21,"The flavor of this natural sea salt is more nuanced and a bit richer than the typical table salt we're all accustomed to, although describing such subtleties is difficult.<br /><br />One noteworthy fact is that this salt contains less sodium than conventional table salt - 330mg per 1/4 teaspoon, versus 590mg per 1/4 teaspoon of conventional table salt.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind is that this natural salt is NOT iodized.  As our thyroid glands require trace amounts of iodine, it may not be wise to entirely eliminate iodized salt from your diet."
positive,29/9/21,This is the best tasting pancake mix in the market and it is so easy to make.
positive,10/7/21,This waffle and pancake mix is delicious!  You can taste a subtle hint of vanilla in them.  They are the only pancakes/waffles that my kids love and the house smells wonderful when they are cooking!
positive,1/3/20,This is a great mix. I mixed it with milk instead of water.  Just follow the directions.
positive,28/7/20,"We are into our third can of this flavorful and easy mix and it just seems to get better and better!  Sunday is pancake day at our house, and today we had blueberry pancakes with real maple syrup.  This mix holds fresh blueberries nicely - don't over-mix the ingredients and you will get nice, fluffy fruit-filled (or not) pancakes that are absolutely first-rate."
positive,28/7/20,"The pancakes were delicious, but they weren't as fluffy as the ones I normally make.  Next time I use this, I'm going to whip the egg whites and see if that helps."
negative,10/11/19,"This expensive pancake mix tastes so processed and fake.  A less expensive bisquick from your local grocery store beats the taste, no doubt.  It's a yucky product."
negative,1/3/20,"We didn't care for this product at all. It seemed to have a funny after taste to it. Wasn't worth the cost. We were unable to even finish using what we purchased it was that nasty."
positive,3/8/19,"I've bought them many times. Good quality and good taste, baby love it, and I love it too. Reccommend it."
positive,6/2/21,"My 1 year old son does really like these- andthey certainly taste better than some of the other finger food snacks.  The only issue is there are lots of crumbs in the can they come in, so it gets messy if you want to dump them into a baggie for on the go."
positive,24/2/21,"These are a great alternative to chips.  I wasn't sure how they would be based on other reviews but I am glad I bought them and wish I would of found them sooner.  I have twin 18 month olds and they can't get enough of them.  I like them too!"
positive,13/5/21,"I purchased this at my local health food store and I am enjoying it immensely.  The juice has a nice, robust texture, and it is not overly salty. The flavor is amazingly fresh and refreshing.<br />I combine it with Odwalla flash-pasteurized 100% carrot juice for a well-above-average vegetable juice that is a good energy-booster and makes for a great alternative to orange juice or other sweet juices.<br />Enjoy!"
positive,1/3/20,"I discovered these when my daughter was about 15 months old. I wish I had found them earlier. They are organic, taste great, are easy for toddlers to handle and very convenient! I always keep some in my purse and in the car when we're out and about. They are not messy, unless of course they decide to squeeze the pouch, which only happens for us when she's not hungry.<br /><br />The Plum Organics line also includes some varieties with fruits and vegetables mixed together. They taste surprisingly good and are one way to get my picky eater to eat some veggies. You can find some varieties at reasonable prices on Amazon, others are more expensive for some reason. Babies R Us has had a sale every other month or so where you can get them for $1 each if you buy them in sets of 8. That is usually when I stock up for the next two months. :)"
positive,28/7/20,"Not as tasty as the strawberry but still very nice. Great to throw in a diaper bag or purse. Spendy but definitely a good deal when it's on sale."
positive,13/5/20,This tea is very good.  I discovered it while visiting in California. The moment I got home I searched local stores for it and I was not able to find it.  Finally I decided to see if Amazon had it and they did and I bought two boxes.  As long as they make it I will buy it.
positive,26/3/21,"You just can't beat the taste of the original Dubble Bubble Gumballs! It really doesn't matter that the taste only last a minute or so, but that is why I bought the tub! The  tub by the way is very convenient  and was shipped to me in A+++ condition! If your longing for the classic taste go for it! You will not be dissappointed!"
negative,29/8/19,"Holy cow!  I have never seen this much grease in a boxed product like this!  Also, it has enough salt to kill an entire family of slugs!  Use it in your garden, don't eat it!"
positive,7/2/21,"A nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market stocks a number of gourmet imported products and I enjoy trying them. One is a variety of Baxters soups from Canada. Today, I had the Butternut Squash and Red Pepper Soup. Quite good. Smooth and mellow. Mild taste, but delicious. Goes down real easy and it only comes to 90 calories per serving (2 servings per can). Alas, the sodium content is a bit higher than I like. Otherwise, very good.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
negative,14/10/21,"I purchased this item to celebrate the birth of my grandson.  I should have opted for real cigars, they might have tasted better. These cigars were very hard and hurt my teeth to chew. Not to mention that these gum cigars were much too sweet."
positive,7/8/20,"As a person who love cinnamon scent and flavor, I find this tea amazing.  I was used to drinking the plain black tea at work and this blend is a nice change from that.  I can probably only have one or two cups a day because it is pretty sweet but I will continue to drink it probably every day.  Enjoy"
positive,1/3/20,"I love this tea which has a deep cinnamon aroma and taste.  It's equally good as an iced tea.  Full marks!"
positive,28/7/20,I was actually surprised at how good these Muffins taste! I have reordered a case.  And they are Gluten Free.
positive,14/9/21,"Although I've only been able to try three of Caribou's k cup blends (Mahogany as well as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G"">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474VPLI"">Caribou Coffee, Daybreak Morning Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>), I've found that Caribou consistently produces the highest quality k cups.  They are head and shoulders above their competitors like Green Mountain and Van Houtte.<br /><br />I should mention that Caribou's Daybreak blend is far and away my favorite k cup flavor of the 20 or so I've been able to sample so far.  But I enjoy a flavorful medium roast.  My boyfriend, on the other hand, prefers an extra bold dark roast.  After our favorable experience with the Caribou brand before, we picked up a box of this coffee and hoped that it would be a great choice for a dark blend.<br /><br />Let me just say that Mahogany is full of smokey delicious flavor.  It's quite strong and dark, but there is no rancid bitterness or acidity that accompanies a lot of the dark roasts.  This coffee packs a powerful punch.  Although that isn't normally my thing, I can enjoy a cup of this with milk and a bit of sweetener.  My boyfriend adores it, though, and it has become a staple blend for him.  I will still drink this on occasion, but it's a bit too potent for me.<br /><br />I think this is the best dark roast I've had the chance to try."
positive,17/12/20,"I like the taste of this coffee. Tried the other brands but got stuck on this one, I also like the ECO friendliness of the company."
positive,2/5/20,"Strong smooth velvety flavor.  Mahogany describes the color and the mood you get when drinking. Absolutely the best. I've found my favorite."
positive,14/7/21,"I like strong coffee, but I don't want it to taste burnt or have an acidic after taste. Caribou Coffee's Mahogany is full bodied with a nice balance of dark notes and acidity.  It's one of my ""go to"" coffees when my favorites like Coffee People's Wake Up Call are out of stock."
positive,18/7/19,I like my coffee strong. This is the first brand that I have tasted that provides the kick I need without the bitterness. I keep my pantry stocked with Mahogony and I do not share!
positive,1/3/20,I happen to like foods that arent as sweet as kool aid or other sugary drinks. Very refreshing after mowing the lawn and helped  keep those afternoon headaches away.
positive,28/7/20,"I saw this item in my local grocery store, and I thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />I have to admit, I was very surprised about how much I enjoyed this item.  I found it refreshing, and I felt that I had a bit more energy. I would happily purchase this product again and again.<br /><br />A word of advice to people complaining that it doesn't taste ""coconutty"" enough.  Coconut water and coconut milk are two very different things.  Coconut water comes from a green, immature coconut, while the milk comes from what we all think of when we think of a coconut...a hard, brown, fiber covered shell.  Just like a green banana and a ripe banana taste different, the same can be said of coconut.  If you don't think of this as a coconut drink or a pina colada, you will probably enjoy it even more."
positive,13/6/20,"I decided to try this although I am not a big fan of flavored waters.  It is quite refreshing and the flavors are quite vibrant and not weak as in some concoctions.  I happen to like both coconut and pineapple so there is no problem with the basic idea and both can be distinguished in the mix.  The one drawback for some is because pineapple is a rather strong addition, even a splash puts it up front and center.  This added to the coconut may make it far too sweet for some.  It would certainly be a good pick me up after a workout or, in my case, after shoeveling the snow that seems to be deposited regularly this winter in the Northeast."
positive,10/3/20,"This seems like a pretty straightforward drink. It's coconut juice and it's pineapple juice, with a bit of sugar and not much else.<br /><br />They claim it's a good source of potassium and electrolytes.<br /><br />For me it was pretty tasty. Granted it was also very sweet. Is it a ""health drink""? I don't know if I'd go that far. It has Vitamin C and trace amounts of Calcium / Iron, but not much else other than sugar.<br /><br />For what it is (something sweet to sip), it's pretty good."
negative,9/5/20,"I'm usually into Pineapple and coconut drinks, but this drink just didn't taste all that great to me. The taste doesn't resemble anything close to a 'Pina Colada' flavor and it was actually difficult to taste the pineapple or coconut in it.  It just tastes tangy and a little sour... like water that has a bit of sugar and sour-ness to it. Yeah, not really a taste I crave. I'm not sure if everyone had this reaction to this drink, but it just didn't appeal to me. I really wanted to like it though, because as I said before... I usually love pineapple coconut drinks."
positive,14/5/19,This is really delicious and not something you can find in the local grocery store.  If you did it would be very expensive and a much smaller quantity.  This is a good deal and super easy to use.

positive,1/3/20,"I picked up a box of this in a discount grocery store in paso robles. The cake was heavenly. I liked it so much, I found another store that sold the mix as well as the icing, and there is even a pink lemonade cookie mix which I bought but haven't tried yet.<br /><br />The taste, is of course lemon, but it reminds me a bit of that flavored mix Country Time I drank as a kid, but less tangy. Its very light and refreshing.<br /><br />I simply loved it. Hope this is more than just a seasonal flavor."

negative,4/8/20,"This is one of the worse tasting soups I've ever eaten. I hated it, and now I have a full case.  It tastes bitter to me, and my husband wouldn't even try it.  Only my cat was trying to reach it on the counter!"
negative,26/12/19,"Given the recent issues with products made in China I have decided to not buy any food products from there so I won't be buying anymore of this snack.  If they ever switch to made in the U.S. I'll buy it again as I did like it."
positive,28/3/21,"If you like nuts and you're looking for a healthy, great tasting snack, you can't go wrong with Almond Crunch!  My husband and I recently eliminated high fructose corn syrup and partially hydrogenated soybean oil from our diet and we feel so much better.  Trying to find tasty snacks that don't contain these products is not easy so we were thrilled to find Mrs. Mays Naturals.  We love the Cashew Crunch as well!"
positive,6/2/20,The nuts used tasted very fresh. The bite sized chunks were just right. It is lightly sweetened but not too sweet. Very satisfying = )
negative,25/4/21,I used to buy these as healthy snacks at my office cafeteria and consider it better than a bag of potato chips.  These taste very crunchy and tasty.<br /><br />Given the kind of unethical food stories we read about China - we need to see some kind of assurance and facts on the processes that the manufacturer is following to make these.  You just cannot import food stuff and sell in the US as gourmet snack food - there needs to be data backing this.<br /><br />Few example of Chinese food (yuk ...):<br /><br />(1) Melamine(kind of platic) in baby food and milk (so wide spread that 80% of milk in China contained this plastic in 2008)<br /><br />(2) Honey contaminated with ciprofloxacin (antibiotic) - because of which it was banned in the US<br /><br />(3) Soy Sauce made from Human hair (not joking google it if you want)<br /><br />(4) Spurious drugs exported to African countries.<br /><br />Need some good facts and quality controls from the Manufacturers that the chinese producers are complying with some good quality controls.
positive,3/8/20,"So... I usually consider pasta to be pasta to be pasta.  It's usually all the same to me.  HOWEVER... when I tried this brand of pasta, I noticed that it does taste better.  I can't describe how exactly, but it does.  I thought maybe it was my imagination (maybe knowing it's organic was influencing my judgment) but my sister commented on it when I served it for her one day.  She wanted to know where I got it - it tasted so good.  Hmmm.  So while usually there isn't much of a taste difference when it comes to noodles and pasta, for this brand there is.  It's subtle, but it's there.  When we moved from California I discovered they didn't sell it in the stores here in NY.  So I was elated when I found Amazon carries it.  Elated over a simple pasta?  Yes, that's how good it is in comparison!  Mmmmmm Mmmmm!"
positive,15/4/19,I have long searched for a great linguine and spagetti and this is it! Just made linguine with clam sauce and each time my husband remarks how terrific it is.  I buy in packages of 5 for both spagetti and linguine and will reorder when close to being out.
negative,9/3/18,Chips Ahoy cookies were not very tasty.  My children and husband would not eat them.  I tried to give them away and everyone refused.
negative,18/5/18,"Sent this as a gift, and found out later that many items were stale.  They loved the thought, though, and loved the way it looked."
positive,9/3/18,absolutely delicious  have tried it on everything from meat and fish to scrambled eggs highly recommend it
positive,27/2/18,"I found this stuff to be very tasty, great with jasmine rice or just as a snack. I don't mind a little MSG if it enhances the flavor."
negative,20/2/18,"My local Walmart and Target both have this, ground or whole bean, at a regular price of less than $9 per 12 oz. bag. It's WAY overpriced here.<br /><br />It is an excellent coffee - I'm drinking it as I write this: an interesting hint of woody, creamy, citrusy taste that's dark but without the burnt aftertaste that comes with many dark roasts."
positive,22/3/18,"This is my family's favorite brand of wheat free gluten free cake mix. This brand is moist, tasty and closer to the traditional cake mixes  people are used to. Namaste products are the best in my opinion of what's available out there in health food stores. Try it! You won't be disappointed."
positive,12/3/18,"I used this mix to make a 9x13 cake in a glass pan using grapeseed oil, spring water, and free range eggs.  I thought the cake had a nice flavor to it but it was not what I was expecting.  I was craving a white cake (like wedding cake) and went to my local store to find something wheat-free, gluten-free and dairy-free; I purchased this vanilla cake mix.  I think it is a very good mix.  I couldn't really taste the vanilla flavor but thought it had a nice flavor.  The cake is yellow, dense (but not like a pound cake) and texture-y like brown rice has more texture than white rice.  I thought the sweetness was just right.  I think I would purchase again but would make pineapple upside down cake with it."
positive,9/2/18,"Took me years to find the ultimate chewing gum, but when I found Wrigley's Orbit White peppermint the search ended. I've been chewing this gum for many years now, I occasionally try something else, but nothing ever wins. The peppermint in this gum can wipe out the worst of bad breath, and toward the end of its chewable life, it doesn't start to taste awful or give you worse breath as many gums will do; it simply loses its flavor.<br /><br />Only drawbacks. I usually chew 2 pieces at a time, so they are a bit small and #2 they just changed the packaging. It used to fit nicely in your back pant pocket, inside suit jacket pocket etc, now its twice as thick and poorly layed out so it's bulky. Not sure why they had to change; probably to do with retail stores layout. This won't prevent me from buying it, but it's really annoying. Wrigley; just never change the flavor!"
positive,7/12/17,"For quite a while, before Amazon starting retailing food items, it was nearly impossible to locate this healthy underground-favorite brownie mix. There were blogs and food sites bemoaning how hard it was to locate.  So when we saw it on Amazon we ordered a case and baked up batches for all our friends and family. The concensus was: it tastes healthier but, never the less, quite good. It is far better when prepared with at least a cup of mini-chocolate chips. (Not regular chips which can sink to the bottom.) We buy good quality Belgian chocolate minichips. This mix is a great alternative if you want less guilt in your guilty pleasures."
positive,24/5/19,If you like goat cheese and smoked cheeses you will love this.  It has a very smokey creamy flavor.  Try it spread on crackers with a little black truffle oil.
negative,9/3/18,"This coffee tastes so nasty I can't even drink it. It's disgusting. I can't believe anything this bitter is acid free. I actually threw away two bags."
positive,18/5/18,"This was my first purchase of this water.  It tastes great and the bottles are thicker than most.  Also, everyone likes that name...haha"
positive,23/3/18,"Surprisingly tasty. Thin and crip. Very Cracker like and good for snacking. I got these for my husband who is on a very low sodium diet. These are great for when we travel.  It isn't easy finding prepackaged low sodium foods that taste good, but these work quite well."
positive,8/9/20,"If you like green tea that brews for 2 minutes max and you do not ""stew"" your tea by just leaving the bag in until the tea is bitter, this is the tea for you! Of course, it can be done that way, but IF you have refined tea taste, then you will like this tea. I, personally, love the taste of a good green tea. I am so glad to find this brand available online. No one sells it in my area."
negative,23/2/18,"I have to admit based on most of the reviews I was sold on getting the 48 pack.  Was a mistake. All three flavors had a distinct taste of the sucralose.  That is the name of the artificial sweetner, in the product.  If you like Splenda,you may like this.  But, it has a distinct taste. Unfortunately not for me. A few friends of mine that tried it and said,""It wasn't bad."" Unfortunately, that was the best of the comments.<br />If you really want a good cup of hot chocolate try Cafe Escapes or Swiss Miss.  Both are twice as good in my opinion. Liked the Escapes best.  Wish I liked the artificial sweetner, but the that taste has a distinct after taste. Probably would be better without the artificial stuff and more regular sugar. If your going to order I would get the small pack to try it.  Better then throwing out 30.  Try Cafe Escapes and Swiss Miss and see for yourself."
positive,18/7/20,"I have purchased other hot cocoa cups but find Grove Square to be about the best of them all.  I usually add two teaspoons of the the flavored coffeemate creamers, my favorite being the Sugar Free Caramel Macchiato.  By adding the sugar free creamer the taste is there but not the calories."
positive,14/6/18,"this hot coca tastes pretty good when brewed on 8oz setting however its not the best I've ever tasted nor the worst. its hard to rate this because everyone has different tastes so its ether you like it or you don't. I my self happen to like it and will buy again unless I find something better."
positive,2/11/18,I really like the flavor of this hot chocolate.  The kids love the flavor too.  I always keep a box of this in the house as my kids and their friends are avid coco drinkers.  This makes it easier and less messy even for the younger ones.  No more powder spilled on the counter tops this way!
positive,14/10/18,My family really enjoys Grove Square Hot Cocoa Milk Chocolate and we keep a supply on hand.  The excellent price is what made us choose this brand but the taste is what makes us continually renew our order.
positive,6/4/20,"the greatest, best chocolate taste in any keurig k-cups out there. will definitely order more. everyone in the office tries to steal them. i'm a chocolate nut, and these pass the test."
negative,9/3/18,I was hoping this was a good idea.  However we tried them even after I heard they tasted bitter like artificial sweetner and it was true.  Not the same as the stuff from the can.
positive,18/5/18,"After drinking Swiss Miss watered down hot chocolates taste for so long, this is a very tasty creamy hot chocolate. My kids love it so I tried it and its the best I had in a while. I will be ordering more."
positive,7/3/18,"A pleasant surprise awaited me when I first ordered Grove Square milk chocolate Hot Cocoa cups. Not a coffee drinker,<br />I use our Keurig K-cup brewer mostly to make cocoa, and a few other brands I tried simply did not hit the mark. Grove Square cocoa tasted full-flavored, with just enough chocolate essence to make it a perfect drink. The first experience made me anticipate (with pleasure) the next time I popped a Grove Square K-cup into the machine!"
positive,24/1/19,This is really tasty hot chocolate.  I like it much more than the dark chocolate flavor but that is just my preference...
positive,27/2/19,"When I weigh the convenience of a K cup against the price and the taste, I would characterize these as a winner. Not the best cup of cocoa on the planet but compared to making it yourself or using a packet, these are pretty darn good. They nice a nice chocolate flavor with no funny after taste that I've had with some other brands. Do not select 10 oz on your machine though. Make it only at 6 or 8 oz otherwise it will be watery in my opinion. All in all a fine cup of hot chocolate."
positive,19/4/20,"OK - this is not the finest European chocolate.  BUT, you can make it in your Keurig and all 3 flavors taste good.  I've joined the ""club"" and get the lowest possible cost.  No charge to join and no effort to quit.  Why not?  It's nice to have when you're dieting, because it's just enough chocolate to keep you on track.  Non-dieters will like it for the convenience."
positive,17/4/20,Very good hot cocoa.  And price was right<br /><br />Awesome and passing the word on the item.  Will buy it again
negative,3/4/20,"This tastes like it has artificial sweetener in it and doesn't taste very chocolatey. The name brand cocoa Kkups are better, or just dumping a regular cocoa packet in a cup and running the water through into it is better."
positive,7/8/19,"You can't beat this deal! 3 Boxes of 16 K-Cups for little more then $20. No other store can even match that price for Hot Chocolate K-Cups. Your normally going to be paying around $12-$16 for 16 K-cups alone. This package give you 48 K-Cups for a great price.<br /><br />The Hot Chocolate itself is great tasting and can be used on mostly all settings for the B70 except for the travel mug. Low in calories and great tasting. Defiantly a must have if you own a Keurig brewing system!"
positive,9/3/18,"Not too sweet.  The best K-cup hot chocolate I've tried thus far. The kids loved drinking and making the hot chocolate."
negative,18/5/18,"I looked forward to a delicious hot cocoa, but was very disappointed with the flavor. It has an awful aftertaste, like the taste you get after drinking a bad diet soda. Also kind of weak, even on the smallest cup setting."
negative,27/1/19,I bought this for my daughter and grandson. They both tried it at different times and they both said it had a funny taste and did not drink it. Therefore I will not buy it again.
positive,10/11/19,"Great taste and does not have the weird chalky after taste that other hot cocoa k-cups have.  I've tasted several and this by far is the better one, but I have to say anything larger than 8oz tastes a bit watered down.  Will definitely purchase more, but at the rate my family downs these, we are probably going to stick to the powdered hot cocoa to be more cost effective."
positive,8/11/19,I love the flavor that this hot chocolate has.  It is very rich and smooth.  Have tried other brands but did not get the results I wanted.  I will definately be ordering from this company again.
positive,25/10/21,"After trying many of the other hot cocoa k-cup options, I find that the Grove Square product tastes the best.  For my personal taste, I find that brewing on the medium cup size setting creates the best taste.  Just add minature marshmellows and it is a great treat.  However, this is not hot chocolate, which may be a turn off for some tasters."
negative,8/5/20,"I just got a Keurig a few weeks ago and wanted to get some hot chocolate for it as an alternative to coffee.  I didn't have super high expectations, but these are absolutely awful.  There is a very strong plastic/chemical taste to these k-cups.  I tried all of them and tried putting some milk in them to help mask the chemical taste and nothing will help.  The only reason I gave these k-cups 2 stars is because my boyfriend can ""tolerate"" them, but I don't trust him because he'll eat just about anything.  In his opinion they are ""not that good"" but he will still drink the mug.<br /><br />From what I've read of other hot chocolate k-cups, you'd be better off just buying a regular mix and doing it that way!"
positive,28/9/18,"Bought this as a gift and was told it tastes really great! Too bad I don't have one of those machines, otherwise, I'd try them out myself.  I might have to consider getting one! If you really like it, you can save some money by subscribing to it for automatic deliveries and to make sure you don't run out."
positive,29/7/19,"Out of all of the hot chocolate kcups that I have tried this is by far the best one. Not weird aftertaste, and not watered down. Tastes amazing and priced fairly, what more could you ask for?"
negative,9/3/18,"I ordered this product because of a good price deal.  Amazon shipped accordingly, absolutely no problems there.  However, the taste of this product was horrendous.  It tasted as if someone through chemicals in a cup and told me to brew it.  I personally will go back to buying Swiss Miss in a can and just using the Keurig to give me Hot Water, cheaper and much better tasting."
negative,18/5/18,"I ordered this specifically b/c they said ""dark chocolate"" so i was hoping for a rich chocolate flavor. They taste very watery, even using the lowest amount of water on the Keurig. The nutritional fact show that it only has 6 grams of sugar - where the normal store bought powder has 22 grams. I didn't like these at all. If you're going for something low sugar, they might be for you!"
negative,17/5/20,"Nice price, and glad to see a subscribe & save option on k-cups. However this was undrinkable in our opinion. Didn't seem to be too watery like another reviewer said, just a bad off taste."
positive,26/3/20,"For those who do not drink coffee, this is a great compliment to the teas and ciders also available for your Keurig."
positive,24/2/20,I am very pleased with this selection.  I have not tried the other hot cocoa brands for Keurig but this one is awesome!  I bought the milk chocolate.
negative,3/5/19,"taste nothing like how cocoa should taste, i'll never touch this again, i'll be trying the swiss miss cocoa maybe better luck"
positive,27/3/20,"The hot cocoa does have a sugar substitute in it, but as far as I could tell, wasn't strong enough to leave that bitter aftertaste you get when they put a lot of it in the ingredients. If you have a very very sophisticated palate perhaps you could taste it a little, but it doesn't take away from the taste of the cocoa, so as far as I'm concerned it wasn't an issue. I would say this is on par with the type of cocoa you'd get in a coffee machine, which is fine, because I don't hate coffee machine cocoa. I have only tried the peppermint so far, and it tasted like peppermint... what can I say? That's what it's supposed to taste like."
negative,31/12/20,"there is a taste of sugar substitute, the aftertaste turns me off, I've even tried using a little bit of milk in the mug before hand to hide the taste. It didn't, so i'm just using Swiss miss powder and a little milk to make it a creamier hot chocolate before using using my keurig."
negative,13/1/20,"I enjoyed these k-cups when I used them. They tasted pretty good. However, I quickly noticed that my Keurig brewer began to have problems after I started using these and other Grove Square k-cups. Even when I would brew other cups, I would get half-brewed cups of coffee, smaller cups, and other issues. I cleaned the brewer, following all the instructions and tips in the manual. The issues came up again as soon as I used these k-cups. What I discovered is that the Grove Square k-cups were gunking up my brewer badly. I had to clean out every part of the brewer completely, including the brewer basket area, the water reservoir, and the internal mechanism. After completing the entire cleaning process two more times my brewer got back to normal. I won't order any Grove Square products again."
negative,21/9/20,"This hot chocolate tastes like hot sugar water with a pinch of coco in it. Although, even the sugary taste is weak, and tainted by the flavor of the artificial sweetener sucralose. The consistency is watery and bland. This is when I made the 8oz cup as directed by the directions on the box.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product."
positive,2/12/20,The price was as fantastic as the taste. So convenient to make and no messy powder  that is hard to dissolve. No major cleanup to deal with either. Highly recommended!
positive,20/11/19,"In my trip through the health area of my local food market I stumbled upon Enjoy Life Boom Choco Boom Dark Chocolate Bar. I just can't resist trying things such as this. Into the cart it went. It's rather good. It says it's dairy, nut and soy free, and I'll take their word. The question is taste. Well, it's a good tasting bar. I have a couple others that I would regard higher. but this one is quite good. It's a bit high in calories (170 per bar) but has no cholesterol or sodium. Not bad. I'll pick it up again.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
positive,2/12/20,"I've ordered most of the cheaper Tea's Etc add on teas and all have been great both in terms of flavor AND value. I cold brew using disposable tea filters closed with toothpicks in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TJ3ZUA"">Takeya Airtight Drink Maker Pitcher / Jug, Set of Two</a> and it works wonderfully. (Those jugs are great, even better if you can still find them half price at Costco.)<br /><br />I'm glad I ordered this when I did, the price has more than doubled! I'd still say it's a GREAT value. This is my go to tea when I want something with a little more flavor than ""regular"" black tea. I don't sweeten my tea, but I think this would be a perfect sweet tea for a hot day. The orange flavor is very palatable unlike some others. It's noticeable without being pungent or artificial. It also isn't spiced like many other orange teas."
positive,11/12/19,I got this for a gift for my father and he loved them.  I will probably get them again but only as a gift due to the cost of sausages.
positive,20/11/19,"This is the best dog food I have ever purchased, and having been a dog training for over 4 years, I've purchased A LOT! We first tried this food when our new addition (an 8-week old German Shepherd) joined the family, and we wanted to keep him on a natural dog food. With any purebred dog, health can be an issue, and you don't want to fill your dog with by-products and plant fillers from day one. This food is praised by unbiased pet food reviewers, and I don't understand why there isn't more publicity for this product. Our other dog, a 5-year old English Bulldog with constant skin/allergy issues, was switched over when we discovered this brand, and she has not had an allergic reaction since! We didn't realize how much it had to do with diet. Her hair used to fall out in spring (not just normal shedding, but actual balding from hair loss), but this has alleviated that problem as well. Now our shepherd is a year and a half old, and he's eating this Large Breed Adult Lamb & Rice flavor. He's not a big eater, but he loves this food! Will definitely keep him, and all future pets, on this brand as long as they keep their standards as high as they are now!! Kudos Diamond for making a wonderful natural dog food.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: I would never buy regular Diamond brand food. If the bag doesn't say ""Natural"" on it, the standards they are kept to are WAY lower and the quality suffers immensely. Stick with Natural (it's a couple dollars more at most!) and your dog will be happier and healthier and live a longer life! Isn't that what we all want?!?"
positive,28/6/20,"These are better than the usual canned fish filets, tastier, and not dry.  There are no bones or skins.  I worried about Mackerel but they are much nicer than, say, kippered herring filets or sardines in oil.  It's easy to pour off the olive oil if that is a worry, but you'd be losing something that is also tasty."
positive,8/8/20,"Ordered 2 cases on different dates and got them within 2 days. Cant find these in the stores so please keep them in stock. Make for a great meal with some veggies or a salad...and this type of fish with omega 3's is good for you."
negative,14/7/21,"I really wanted these to taste good, but there is something in there that is very bitter. I had to add too much sugar to make them even slightly palatable. No one would eat them. They LOOKED delicious after baking and they're healthy, but that's only if you manage to choke one down. I have tried their gingerbread, corn muffin mix, and jalapeno cornbread mix and those are all great."
negative,2/12/20,"I bought these graham sticks based on their excellent reviews and having purchased Earth's Best organic vanilla cookies, had high hopes for a healthy snack to serve my kids.  Needless to say, I should have purchased one box at the grocery store first before committing to 6 boxes through Amazon (which you are unable to return -even unopened boxes- since this is a food item).  The crackers smelled strange even before tasting them.  My 5 year old turned up her nose and refused to eat them anymore after trying a few.  I wish I could describe the taste, but it would be really hard.  It may sound strange for an organic food, but it was almost like a faint chemical smell.  At best, I can say that they weren't anything like a regular graham cracker flavor (even as an organic option they should have a better taste).  My 2 year old did eat some of them without complaint, so I am hoping she will tolerate them through 6 boxes so I feel like I did not waste my money.  Good price, but definitely test one box first to see if you like them."
positive,20/11/19,"15 month old loves to eat them on the go! They seem great for a healthy, quick, and easy snack!"
negative,1/3/21,"These cups are artifically sweetened with sucralose - I didn't realize until I tried one, and ended up with a little bit of a headache, which made me check the ingredient list - it isn't noted on the front of the box.  They definitely have an artificial taste, I would not buy them again."
positive,5/5/21,"Slightly crumbly, but overall a very good cookie.  In my opinion very similar to Chips Ahoy but more airy, less dense."
positive,2/12/20,This sauce is very good on anything you cook or grill or you can use it as a dip for veggies etc.  It has just enough heat to make everything taste better.
positive,20/11/19,"I had brought this as a dipping sauce for dumplings and egg rolls I made at home. It taste's great and I think it the same sauce I get at some Thai places cause it tastes the exact same."
positive,9/10/21,"Several Gevalia brand coffee's have been among my favorites for years....Velvet Noir, Signature Blend, Traditional Roast, etc.  The Breakfast Blend is my ""go to"" every day grind.  It's got a perfect blend of bold rich taste, terrific aroma, and full taste, with very low acidity and harshness.  Just incredible coffee!"
positive,6/3/21,"THESE CHEWS ARE TASTY AND CHEWY. THE PRICE IS EXCELLENT FOR WHAT YOU GET. WE HAVE PLENTY AROUND FOR OURSELVES AND TO SHARE WITH FAMILY. GREAT TREAT FOR LITTLE KIDS.<br />PLUS THEY ARE GOOD FOR YOU WITH NO ADDED JUNK. JUST LICORICE.<br />GREAT BUY, GREAT TASTE."
positive,12/2/21,"For those of you who like/love black licorice, I seriously recommend this product.  i eat it because I love black licorice, and only recently found that what I have observed is now reported by nuitionists as well.  These is evidence that black licorice is an aid to those with constipation.  It comes in other flavors too, but the medicinal effects only come the black."
positive,2/12/20,"This is excellent green tea.  It is just a little spicy and very flavorful.  Green tea is so good for you, you won't even miss your morning coffee.  And..... you are helping children when you buy Tea District Children's Tribute tea."
positive,20/11/19,The content has been consistantly good. The calamares have been tasty. The price was also very reasonable
positive,25/6/21,"At my local Costco store, I bought Pace salsa numerous times. The salsa tastes feel rich and I love the jalepenos Pace puts in the salsa. Spicy, but not too the point where I'm sweating and can't enjoy my salsa and chips.<br /><br />The salsa doesn't feel watered down and this is a great ""go to"" salsa choice."
positive,17/3/20,Water based sardines without salt is.... awwfuul.  Not bad of a product here--far superior to the types I normally purchase at stores.
positive,20/10/21,"I'm on a very low sodium intake- 300mgs per day- and these are great. Good taste and low sodium. I just put a little mustard on them and yum!"
positive,21/7/20,"I found out about these from a co-worker. They are delicious, low calorie, and pack some protein. Eating these rather than my usual pretzels and chips helped me slim down. I get them by the case now from Amazon since it is a better buy (and my supermarket doesn't always carry them)."
positive,22/2/21,"I've been gluten-free for a little over a year and I've struggled with finding tasty and affordable alternatives to my favorite foods. The great thing about this mix is that it's really easy to make, affordable, and the pancakes are so tasty, my children do not object to eating them--saving me the time of making two batches of pancakes. If they didn't see me eating them, I don't even think my kids would notice that they are eating gluten-free pancakes."
positive,8/6/21,"It's great! I actually used this to make gf donuts the other day. I love how convenient it is. It's so hard being gluten free so this is god sent for how many things you can make with this. I have celiacs and I haven't had any sort of negative reaction to this. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who can't have gluten but still wants things like pancakes and waffles and donuts and other fun things."
positive,2/12/20,"If you only knew....<br /><br />Bisquick Gluten Free(GF) is by far one of the best options out there for people with Celiac or Sensitivity to Gluten.<br />I honestly don't know how healthy it is for you. What I do know it that it is a great option for people trying<br />to eat as normal as possible. This GF option has been a great meal saver for my wife who this last year was diagnosed<br />with Celiac and got sick in tired of tasting gross tasting GF options or super simple meat and vegetables options for meals.<br /><br />We have made all types of breakfast items, biscuits, even fried food (chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks, fried fruit,...) We bout our own little frier<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0016NQ49Q/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=talkinhome-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=B0016NQ49Q&adid=0XK6HZPJRKAED855HEWP<br /><br />In short, It has not only been a great option, but also has been quite tasty allowing my wife to make one meal for both of us not worrying that<br />it will taste bad to me.<br /><br />Hope this was helpful."
positive,20/11/19,"Neither myself nor my husband can have any type of corn products, but we love cornbread.  This mix makes biscuits that taste just like corn bread to us.  Nice to find an alternative that tastes so great!  Appreciate having this order size option as well since it's often missing from grocery store shelves."
positive,25/1/21,"Finally a great and easy GF option for pancakes, waffles, biscuits, etc from Bisquick!! Both of my kids have Celiac and absolutley LOVE this stuff.  Wish the container was bigger. But we're just happy to have better tasting options for breakfast now. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.  Can't taste a difference, but the rest of the family uses the cheaper stuff."
positive,1/7/21,"Gluten Free goes mainstream with the addition of gluten free Bisquick.<br />General Mills does a good job making the gluten free version of their famous brand!<br /><br />Are you gluten free? Do you know someone that is? An estimated 12 - 50 million Americans are affected by gluten, the protein found in wheat, barley and rye grains and most do not even know it. Gluten is a toxin for many, especially those with Celiac Disease, Autism, Diabetes, Multiple Sclerosis, Crohn's Disease and a host of other gluten intolerant and gluten sensitivity issues.<br />It is quite challenging for those following a gluten free diet to find and afford products that are gluten free. Wheat is one of the most prevalent ingredients in the American diet.<br />Find the best tasting gluten free foods at [...] exclusively. We have been serving the gluten free community for over 12 years."
positive,30/9/20,"My family loves Bisquick Pancakes, my kids did not notice the difference from this product and regular pancakes. The only problem is the price, I will try Pamelas this week, price seems more reasonable."
positive,15/3/20,"Our family has been wheat-free for 3 years and gluten-free for 1 1/2 so we've tried just about every mix out there.  I just found that Bisquick has a GF mix while in the grocery store and decided to give it a try.  This is DEFINITELY the best mix that we have ever tasted: smooth, not grainy.  I don't know that side-by-side with regular wheat pancakes that you would notice the difference!"
positive,6/7/21,"I have been GF for the past year and have tried all sorts of flour alternatives. This one is certainly the best, and the best part about it, is you can substitute it for any creation that calls for original bisquick. The best so far is the waffles that you can make following the directions on the back. I will be ordering again!! My only complaint is that the boxes are small compared to the other boxes of bisquick available on the shelves."
positive,29/6/21,"Can as be used to make cookies - even egg free!  I just used the mix, enough apple sauce to make a batter, some coconut butter and added vanilla and cinnamon and baked.  turned out soft delicious cookies with only 5 minutes from box to the oven.  However, even wallmart carries this for about one dollar per box less than here."
positive,29/6/21,"Ok--I just bought BIsquick GF and the first thing I tried to make were the drop biscuits (recipe listed on the box).  These are not the kind that are rolled out & cut--these are ""drop ""biscuits.  The results were very tasty.  The taste of this GF bisquick is very much like the original, but the taste is not as tart as the original.  If you want a similar buttermilk taste, you will need to use buttermilk instead of milk in the biscuit recipe.  I noticed something else that was odd and might be a problem for anyone new to cooking; it seems that the amount of mix called for is not quite right.  I read the side of the box and it claims that there are 3 2/3 cups of mix in the box (11 servings of 1/3 cup each).  The biscuit recipe called for 2 cups of mix. I measured heaping teaspoonfuls into a measuring cup and I don't even have a cup of mix left in the bag?????  I know this mix doesn't have wheat flour and maybe that kind of flour measures differently, maybe if I dug into the bag with a cup, I would have used less, but the recipe came out right.  So, there must be a misprint on the box.  I am assuming I measured properly because I have biscuits that can be dipped in gravy, smothered with butter & jam, or sliced to make those yummy McDonald's breakfast sandwiches. By following the instructions, I have A LOT of biscuits.  If you are single, or just cooking for two; you might want to cut the recipe in half.  You will still have plenty and you won't go through the box so quickly.  This mix cost me around $5.00 and I don't have enough left to make anything else, without buying another box; which I will because these biscuits are really, really good.  Still, if you are watching your budget, don't prepare more than you need.<br /><br />About these biscuits:  yummy, fairly golden (because the recipe calls for eggs), and they can be sliced with some crumbly edges, just like glutenous ones.  Without the eggs, you probably won't get the nice eye-appealing color.  Even though they are drop biscuits, you still have to cut-in shortening or margarine. If you don't have a cutter, you will need to use a long fork.  That is more difficult, so if you are a celiac that has been craving biscuits; buy a cutter.  It will cost you as much as a box of this mix.  The biscuit recipe also calls for milk, so if you want that nice tart taste that is reminiscent of the original bisquick; you will need to use buttermilk.<br /><br />The mix is made up of rice flour, sugar, leavening, potato starch, salt, & xanthum gum.  Many mixes and goodies made with rice flour taste grainy.  Bisquick has done a fantastic job with the rice flour.  It is not grainy at all; I repeat, it is not grainy at all.  For those of you new to celiac cooking; using a starch such as corn, potato, or tapioca is normal and adds a lightness to the baked item that wouldn't be possible with rice flour alone.  Leavening is simply baking soda or powder and is necessary for rising.  The sugar and salt are for flavor and consistency,  and yes, they are necessary.  As for the Xanthum gum; it is a perfectly natural ingredient and it gives celiac-safe baked goods a bit of elasticity (acting as a replacement for the gluten).  You will find Xanthum gum in just about every baked goodie made for people with celiac disease.  Can you just make your own mix and spend less money?  Sure, but you will have a very difficult time finding rice flour as finely ground as the rice flour that is the predominant and main ingredient in this mix.<br /><br />The other recipes listed on the box are for pancakes, waffles, strawberry shortcakes, pizza crust, ultimate chicken fingers, and oven baked chicken.  You can find more recipes on their website.<br /><br />I recommend this product for the taste.  I do wish that more mix was in the box, for the price."
positive,26/7/21,"This mix made tasty, crispy waffles using a standard waffle iron, but the whole box only made 3.5 waffles.  This would be a five star product for me if I could get more than one family meal out of it for the price."
positive,21/10/21,"My son just started the Gluten Free diet and I have tried some foods out there just seeing what he will eat. He loved it, I couldn't believe it at first but he kept eating. I'm really glad that I was able to find something that he loves to eat for breakfast. My little girl has starring to eat it to and she says it taste good. I buy it every time I run out cause I love eating it too."
positive,25/10/21,"With all natural ingredients and no preservatives; all I can say is ""fantastic"".  There is no expiration date but I would eat this within a week or two -- faster if it's opened.  Absolutely excellent!<br /><br />You can freeze these with no loss of quality.<br /><br />Don't order if the weather is hot because they ship it in cool bags with cold packs instead of styrofoam with dry ice.  My orders usually arrive cool but not cold."
positive,29/6/21,I gave this as a stocking stuffer to my husband to remind him of our last holiday in beautiful Jamaica.  It has a truly tropical taste that is very unique and yummy.
positive,5/7/21,"This is such a great product from subtle flavors and aromas for delicate dishes to smokey salts for hearty cooking, this is a great product for the chef who loves flavor and experimenting in the kitchen.  This is such a cool product!!"
positive,17/9/21,I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT BEFORE. THESE SNACKS ARE CRISP AND GREAT TASTING. ALSO LOW IN CALORIES. I RECOMMEND THEM HIGHLY. THEY ARE SHIPPED ALMOST INSTANTLY AND ARRIVE WITHIN A FEW DAYS.
negative,18/8/21,"This is the first time we bought this tea from Amazon, we used to get it directly from Revolution Tea. I don't know if that made any difference, or if it was just a change in the tea's composition (along with the packaging), but what used to be my wife's favorite tea now has a metallic smell and aftertaste, with much less of a pomegranate flavor and now a strong, almost cheap-generic-green-tea flavor. Really disappointing, especially since we're stuck with six boxes."
positive,31/7/21,"This Melitta decaf Riviera Sunset coffee has an excellent taste.  There is none of the weird aftertaste you get with some other decaf coffees.  It's a smooth, mellow taste, even a little sweet and with a hint of cocoa.  I really enjoyed this.  The grind is listed as extra fine, but I didn't find it particularly fine myself.  When I grind my own beans, I have a finer grind than this, but I still expected a stronger taste from the Melitta than I would from other store brands.  However, the Melitta decaf was actually slightly weaker than other store brands we have tried.  We like our coffee strong, about 1/2 cup ground coffee for 4 to 4 1/2 cups water (using measuring cups).  This ratio was not quite strong enough for me with the Melitta, but that is easily adjustable.  The nice thing about the coffee is that, even when I made it very strong, the smoothness remained.  I will definitely be trying other types of Melitta coffee in the future."
positive,18/10/21,"Wonderful, smooth, satisfying decaf coffee with a fabulously rich flavor.  No chemical aftertaste, like many decafs I've tried.  Apparently, the Swiss Water Process used to decaffeinate this coffee leaves flavor intact, something I've found terribly disappointing in other brands.<br /><br />I've been VERY impressed by the flavor dimensions of this Riviera Sunset blend; served it to some neighbors (who simply won't touch decaf coffee) who were pleasantly surprised to find they actually enjoyed a cup of decaf.  No bitter notes; my husband, who usually complains fervently about the flavor of decaf, has been asking for a cup of this every evening, after dinner.  Believe me, this alone is QUITE an endorsement!<br /><br />I love using my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011528S0"">Zojirushi CD-WBC30 Micom Electric 3-Liter Water Boiler and Warmer, Champagne Gold</a> for coffee, tea, and cooking.  I brew my coffee a cup at a time with an individual Melitta brown paper filter <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0T2"">Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 2, 100-Count Filters (Pack of 6)</a>and filter cone (similar to this one:<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001794Q0S"">Ready Set Joe/Mug</a>) and found that the extra fine grind of the Riviera Sunset blend imparted an unusually rich, deliciously multidimensional flavor.  Much fresher than conventional, by-the-pot coffee.  This method also allows me to brew strong coffee (for me) and a milder version for my hubby.<br /><br />Take time to ""bloom the grounds"" first (add a little hot water to the fresh coffee grounds, moistening completely, and then wait about 30 seconds before brewing) for best flavor (this goes for ANY coffee).<br /><br />Melitta's Riviera Sunset decaf blend is enthusiastically recommended by a coffee snob!  You'll love it as is, no sweeteners or creams needed to disguise this wonderful flavor.  I look forward to ordering more.<br /><br />Update 9/21/10:  Just ordered my first 3-pack through Subscribe & Save; great deal for some delicious decaf!"
positive,29/6/21,"Disclaimer: I'm a coffee addict.  I'm also a Starbucks addict, so I've become a bit snobby about my coffee preferences and can't stand the economy stuff.  I've had regular Melitta coffee before and was favorably impressed by it, so I decided to give the decaf version a try. Especially when the weather gets cold, I like a nice hot cup of coffee in the evenings and don't particular want to be tossing and turning hours later.<br /><br />The Riviera Sunset decaf coffee is an excellent decaf for those times you don't want the real thing. It had a nice, rich flavor with no bitter aftertaste.  While I continue to prefer the real thing on most occasions, I'm glad to know there's a good, flavorful substitute for when I don't want caffeine."
positive,16/9/21,"I've tried to give up my coffee habit, but it just hasn't been easy.  DH and I did manage to switch to decaf a couple years ago, so I suppose that's something.  I'm a moderate coffee drinker- I like 1-2 cups of hot joe to get me started in the morning, and *love* a nice chilly iced coffee on a hot afternoon.  This Melitta ""Riviera Sunset"" decaf is smooth and doesn't have the bitter aftertaste that I dislike in one of the leading coffeeshop brands.  The flavor is great and I've enjoyed it both hot and iced."
positive,24/8/21,"This coffee smelled wonderful while it was brewing.  My husband drinks a lot more coffee than I do, and he agreed that this is a great tasting coffee.  We are looking forward to trying Melitta's other varieties."
positive,24/6/21,"This is the best decaf my family and I have tried in a long time. It's smooth, not bitter and has enough flavor without being too strong like some other brands I've tried. I like that it's decaffeinated using the natural swiss water process instead of chemicals. That's a big plus for me because many brands don't tell you how they decaffeinate their coffee. I usually buy whole bean, but this ground is so nice and fine, and it saves me time having to grind it and get it just right. I'd suggest following the instructions given on the bag for the best taste, seal tightly and store in the refrigerator to keep the flavor. This is one I'll be buying again."
positive,27/9/21,"I have had to cut back on caffeine recently because of heart palpitations that seemed to be made worse by all the coffee I drink (5 cups a day, maybe.) So I am mixing 1/3 Melitta Colombian and 2/3 decaf. I substituted this for the other decaf I have been drinking and found that it has a rich smooth taste. Very little to none of the burnt taste that decaf often has. The price on amazon makes it a pretty good buy as well. I don't care for the packaging, however. I couldn't get it open without cutting the top, and then I had to transfer it to an old coffee can to store it, with all the mess that that entails. If it were in a can, I would be more inclined to buy it. But the taste for a decaf is quite good."
positive,29/6/21,"Hands down, by far the absolute worst tasting tea I have ever had.... and I have ALLOT! I am an avid tea drinker and I just can't get it down. The benefits are supposed to be amazing so I'll keep it around to water down and sugar up but wow it's bad. So strong too, tastes like dirt (*that's been pissed on in the woods)."
positive,5/8/21,"My husband and I both like coffee with rich flavor and good taste, but we do not like the bitter or burnt taste some coffees have.  This Community Hazelnut has excellent flavor.  We make it fairly strong and are very pleased with this coffee."
positive,29/6/21,"The sinus buster tea had an interesting aroma when seeping; it's taste is acquired not offense at least to say more like burnt bark or really overheated coffee. I had no drainage of my sinuses while drinking one cup of the tea the next morning I could feel relief of pressure and pain. I would prefer this product over any inhaled sinus relief agent. As a plus all the ingredients of the tea are on the package in english nothing unknown."
negative,31/7/21,"I've been Paleo for six months, as has my partner. We both found these inedible. All four kinds (which, by the way, taste nearly the same).<br /><br />I'm not sure what it is about them either. It seems like they would be good from the ingredients. But something about the combination of flavors just does not taste good. I kept trying them again, hoping that they would grow on me. They sure didn't. We finally tossed them.<br /><br />So, I would advise getting just one from a local co-op or something before you buy a whole bunch online. I sure which I had."
positive,11/9/21,"My husband has to limit the amount of sugar he takes in and these contain no sugar, and they taste great!"
positive,12/8/21,"I had coconut trees growing in my backyard in Southeast Asia, and enjoyed drinking coconut water right from the coconut itself. Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water with Pulp is the closest to the real thing that I've found."
positive,31/7/20,Great sauce! Used in many Jamaican restaurants to help with the heat of the jerk seasoning. Most use Walkerwood jerk seasoning to make the jerk and pour this on later on the jerk or the rice.
negative,13/6/20,"These are very tasty, but way too sweet & sugary.  I felt like I was eating candy instead of meat.  If that's okay with you, then you'll probably love these, but I was looking for something a bit healthier.  Yes, I know it says 'sweet' in the product name, but I bought it because of the no hormone, no antibiotic, no artificial ingredient aspect."
positive,31/7/20,"I don't eat chips often, but when I do, these are some of my favorites. They have all the flavor and texture of traditional tortilla chips, but it is the subtle lime flavoring that makes them special. The lime flavoring appears to be a seasoning that has been dusted on. Some chips seem to have barely any flavor and I find myself looking for those with the most. Still, none of them have quite enough for my tastes. I wish that these chips had more that just a ""hint"" of lime."
positive,13/6/20,"I've tried tons of GF pancake mixes.  I could choke on most of them or just decide not to ever eat pancakes again.  These are so moist and delicious.  My 92 year old grandmother was just diagnosed with celiac disease.  She loves them too.  My wife and children who are not GF also love them.<br />m"
positive,26/9/20,"I was expecting hard tasteless healthy cookies.  It is soft, a little chewy and yummy.  Very tasty."
positive,17/10/20,These are excellent. They taste great and are just the right size.  Two can make an on the go breakfast that is tasty and good for you.  The larger size breakfast cookies are just too big. 2 of these are perfect.  My husband had gotten out of the habit of eating breakfast- too much trouble- but since I bought these he is good about grabbing one or two on the way out the door.
positive,14/12/20,I think this is a really good deal. I seal it up in a rubbermaid container and just scoop it out to brew. Good stuff!
positive,29/5/20,"I normally purchase already-grown containers of cat grass at my local pet store. However, the last few pots developed bugs in them, which just wasn't sanitary. I bought these seeds from Hirts and they grew insanely fast! My cats love the taste. I've already bought another pack so I can re-plant once the cats finish off this batch."
positive,9/12/20,"I love these.  They really taste like a soft PB&J sandwich, and you can bring them anywhere!  Kids would love them too.  I hope they're available again soon because I'm running low!"
positive,4/8/20,"Since Republic of Tea discontinued their Bing Cherry Vanilla tea, I was looking for a replacement.  The flavor of this tea is very different from Republics - it's better.  The smell is very rich, like toasted vanilla and cherry.  It almost has a coffee smell, but not quite.  I don't like coffee, but this tea is incredible.  Glad I found it.  Best of all, the price!"
positive,31/7/20,"This coffee was delicious! I actually purchased it as a gift, but since I paid $30 for 1 lb of coffee, I tasted the freakin coffee!<br /><br />It was so good! I meant to purchase the light roast, but accidentally ordered the medium. It was full bodied and delicious, totally lacking the high acidity that you find with most commercial coffees. I can't afford 100% pure Kona all the time and normally buy blends, but this coffee is the delicious gourmet coffee you need to buy and keep for company or to treat yourself now and then."
positive,13/6/20,"Key lime pie is one of my all-time favorite desserts. When I heard about this gum I was definitely a skeptic, I figured it'd taste more like just a standard, citrus-y/mint gum. I was wrong! This definitely tastes like real key-lime pie filling: actual key-lime flavor with a milk-sweet taste that's not too overpowering. The flavor actually lasts for quite a while too (though it's much more powerful within the first 5 minutes). Try it!"
positive,21/11/20,"I loved the flavor and the fact that it was so long lasting. Everyone in the office eats it now. We only eat half a stick so we are not sitting around with a big wad of gum in our cheeks, but so far I have not been able to outchew this gum for flavor.  If you like a bright, citrus-y taste that is not too overpowering, you will love this. If you like a more minty gum, then go for the mint chocolate chip flavor of this gum."
positive,25/5/21,"Like other reviewers, I had low expectations for this gum, but was happily wrong.  I love key lime pie, and lime flavor in general.  When first chewed, this gum has the tangy-bite of key lime, with a creamy sweetness, and a hint of graham cracker crust flavor.  After the initial flavor burst fades, there is that surge of artificial sugary-sweetness that occurs with some brands/flavors of sugarfree chewing gum, but the surge isn't as overwhelming or long lasting as it is with some sugarfree gums.  Once that fades, the gum has a mellow, subtle, lime zest flavor.  I really like this gum."
positive,25/5/21,"I, just like all the other reviewers love this seasoning. I have been making Cajun Catfish with this seasoning for about 15 years. I have tried other seasonings when this one was not available, but it's just not the same. If you want to try my recipe, it's very easy. I melt butter and brush the catfish fillet with it and generously<br />coat the fish with the seasoning. Meanwhile I preheat a cast iron skillet. When the skillet is hot I put in about 2 tbs olive oil and than about 3 tbs of butter and fry the fish to a golden to dark brown on each side About 4-5 minutes and add some more butter if the pan becomes to dry after turning the fish. During this I make a pot of spaghetti, my wife likes angle hair, after the pasta is done, drain it and remove the fish to a platter, turn off the heat under the skillet, add a little more olive oil and butter, scrape up the bits of fish left on the bottom of the skillet and dump the pasta into the skillet and mix it around to soak up the buttery oil, than sprinkle some more seasoning on the pasta and serve with the fish. Everyone love it. To give this dish a little color, you can add a bag of fresh spinach to the pasta water during the last 2 minutes of cooking, or stir in a small can of diced Cajun tomatoes after you put the pasta in the skillet, or use both. Hope you enjoy it if you try it."
positive,20/1/21,"I have been using this spice mix for many years but, I have found it hard to find lately. I decided I would check Amazon and I was very surprised to see it available! I am a fairly good cook and I have developed some easy dishes using this mix and it is very unusual and tasty! A 12 pack is a lot of this spice but, it does keep for years and I use it quite often. Give your family the kick it deserves with ""Luzianne Cajun Seasoning"""
negative,15/1/21,"My baby didn't seem into these dinners, so I tried them. They're not terrible, but not good either. We'll stick with the EB fruits and veggies until she's ready for table foods."
positive,8/2/21,"I bought this for my 8 month old grandson to try.  He loves it!  I'm so pleased that I am ordering it for my infant great-niece and also for part of an all organic baby shower gift.  This food is inexpensive, convenient, and organic.  Best of all . . . He likes it!  I'm setting up the recurring delivery method for my grandson.<br />CORRECTION!  The product I ordered two weeks ago was $7.76 a case.  Now the cost is $11.03.  That's quite a price hike.  Is there any way to be notified if the price goes back down?"
positive,10/2/21,"Liked the Baby food(yes for myself ;-P) really tasty and smooth consistency for an organic treat,except the Peaches and Apricots not soo much nice flavor and such.Really good though and timely shipping excellent buyer!!"
positive,9/10/20,This is the best-tasting brown rice I have ever had.  Kind of a nutty flavor.  This is the only rice I have ever had that tastes great all by itself.
positive,31/7/20,"Here is a great way to get that tast of your childhood without all the sugar.<br />Even without blood sugar problems i want to cut back on any excess sugar.<br />This allows you to have a drink option (other than water) with a perky taste that<br />is low calorie and sugar free.<br /><br />Parents dont tell the kids and just serve it, they will never know the diffrence.<br />Its that good"
positive,13/6/20,"I've been searching for alternatives for high calorie high sugar drinks.  After tasting many different products, this one is my favorite by a long shot.  I can't believe it has no sugar at all.  The little packets make a nice quantity of the beverage.  Some of the other brands I have tried gave me heartburn or they weren't sweet enough.  This one is perfect.  I tried the cherry flavor also which is good, but not as good as the tropical.  You have to be careful with spilling it because it does tend to stain, but any traditional stain remover did just fine at preventing the stains from setting in to carpet, clothes, and countertops.<br /><br />Ditch the sugary alternatives and you can save hundereds of calories per day just by using this instead.  Cutting calories just became a lot more easy!<br /><br />Edit:  I still use this product multiple times a day.  It's great to have a premixed drink in the fridge that you can go to that tastes great, and you don't have to worry about calorie intake, or getting the kids all hyped up from sugars.  I also took 2 packets on vacation and mixed it on site.  Saved time and money instead of stocking a fridge up when you would just have to throw away the unused portion at the end of the trip.  I just wish they made a orange and maybe a berry flavor as well."
positive,5/12/20,"The Tropical Punch flavor tastes just like I remember as a kid.  Easy to use, and fully dissolves in cold water (although I'll use a chopstick or knife to stir the mix while the water is filling)."
positive,1/11/20,"I have been having blood sugar and yeast issues, and I've had to cut out sugar.  I had never tried sugar-free Kool-Aid before, so I was a bit nervous about this one.  Luckily I found the taste to be really good.  Even my picky kids love it!<br /><br />I love the fact that these come pre-sweetened in individual pouches.  You just tear one open and stir it into 2 quarts of water.  It couldn't be faster or easier!  It even dissolves well in cold water.<br /><br />I just ordered a case of the cherry flavor, too.  My kids and I can't get enough of the tropical punch flavor, so we're excited to try cherry, too."
negative,14/1/21,"Maybe it's just me, but I have used this extract in my oatmeal (same amount as McCormick extracts) and I can't taste any flavor at all.  Very disappointing."
negative,6/6/21,I believe gerber may have mixed apricots with the peaches. It now has a sour after taste and my son hates it.
negative,21/7/20,"They have some textured powder stuff on them that makes them taste bad.. bad after taste. I guess it's so they don't stick together. Never again"
negative,5/1/21,I dont like the taste of this at all.  I have some other fennel tea from another company not on amazon and it is fantastic.  Cant remember exact name but think it is something like MB - is a french company and I got it in canada and by mail order after that.  It is much better to my taste.  Never dreamed there would be this much variance among fennel seeds as only ingredient.
positive,23/1/21,"I got a case of Yuban cans from Amazon for an amazing price and now that I've been reintroduced to Yuban I'm sticking with it.  It's Colombian which is the coffee I prefer anyway but Yuban  must have a special formula for roasting and grinding that results in such excellent coffee.  Cans have the foil seals that you can peel off so you don't need to use a can opener and of course plastic lids to reseal.  Sniffing this coffee as I scoop it into my coffee maker is half the delight!!  Just so excellent and suits my tastes perfectly.  Buying the case is very convenient too!!!!"
positive,31/7/20,"And a great price from amazon. My wife and I had dinner last night at a very high end restaurant and while everything was magnificent we both thought the coffee wasn't as good as our Yuban. I often wonder about Starbucks whose coffee I find undrinkable. My son says it's an acquired taste."
positive,13/6/20,"Bought these at a local store due to the great ingredients with none of the bad chemicals, and have been waiting for them to be in stock here. I'll definitely buy more when they are available, as they are the best shortbread cookies I've ever had, my son agrees, and I love that they're basically as good as you could get if you made them yourself, with ingredients you can pronounce and won't kill you. :)  SO delicious!!!"
positive,1/12/20,"I buy these at a local grocery store, not from amazon.com.<br /><br />They are absolutely lovely. Light and crisp, they're like naked Cheetos, that are actually fairly healthy. They can be topped with most anything, sweet or savory. Great for midnight snacks, afternoon snacks, or crumbled up in tomato soup at lunch or dinner. Wish they'd make them in flavors, they'd beat the pants off most ""diet"" snacks I've ever seen!"
positive,30/1/21,"Since I am counting calories I find Wasa crisp'n light very tasty. You can eat three of them and feel like you are eating a lot more than you really are. I think the taste is great and have told all my friends about them."
negative,1/1/21,"I have a tried a few of these Wasa crisp breads.  This one was by far the worst.  It was in essence entirely flavorless.  It tasted to me the way that I expect that those little packing Styrofoam peanuts would taste.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong it didn't taste bad, hence the 2 stars, it just didn't taste like anything.  Looking for a low-cal snack type cracker?  Try the Wasa Sourdough Rye crackers.  Now those are heavenly!"
positive,11/1/21,"My wife always made her own gravy from scratch and is good at it. However, this gravy is fantastic, idiot proof (even I can make it) and reminds me of my grandma's cooking. My wife loves it and this will definitely be a new staple for our cupboard."
positive,31/7/20,"Awesome tasting Tea in a 16 oz. can!  I highly recommend this product because it taste great and doesn't cost a lot."
positive,13/6/20,"I make an extended butter using this oil, water and liquid lecithin.  It is just the BEST tasting spread ever and much healthier because of the walnut oil.  I keep mine refrigerated to preserve that wonderful taste and aroma.  It tends to settle out so be sure to shake it before using to get the full flavor and consistency. I didn't know to do this on the  first container and when I got to the bottom it was very thick, almost sludgy, with the roasted bits.  Amazon's price is pretty fair although I can occasionally find it locally (TJ Maxx)a bit cheaper. But I must say ordering from Amazon and getting it shipped straight to me is VERY convenient.  I've never had any problems with damaged or leaking containers on this product (well maybe a small dent in the metal but that's all)."
positive,14/1/21,"So happy I got this on a subscription. I might even have to increase the frequency that it is delivered. I've used it in everything from scrambled eggs to brownies. It's not mild like olive oil, but it has enhanced the flavor of everything I've cooked!"
positive,7/12/20,"This oil has a wonderful, mild, roasted walnut flavor that I found irresistible in a salad dressing (it will now be my go-to oil for homemade dressings).  There is a recipe for vinaigrette right on the back of the can.  Bought it because it's omega-3 content is second only to flaxseed oil, plus, it's made in California!<br /><br />Definitely buy it on Amazon, so much cheaper than the grocery store."
positive,5/5/21,"the first moment you bite into this cracker, you will notice the difference.  This tasty, crunchy, organic cracker is perfect with soup or salad.  It is certified organic, using quality ingredients.  The cracker is dry, not greasy or oily like a typical potato chip.<br /><br />comes in several different varieties and flavors.<br /><br />* recommended *"
positive,23/11/20,"This is a terrific baby food.  It has beef and spinach AND tastes great!  It was the first meat baby food my son would eat.  I tasted it myself and it's quite good."
positive,29/8/20,"My daughter loves this!  She is picky so she doesn't always eat as many healthy foods as she should.  This flavor gives her the vegetables and protein that she needs.  It is a little bit grainier than other stage 2 foods but still very usable for babies over 6 months."
positive,18/1/21,"We live in the middle of nowhere so we end up ordering a lot of spices etc. that can't be found locally.  This gives great chipotle taste with just a little sprinkled on.  I'm going to order a few more of these because I never want to run out of it."
negative,18/6/21,"I purchased this coffee to make iced coffee drinks.  It has very little 'coffee' taste, and the dark chocolate taste is more chemical than chocolate.  Similar to the taste of flavoring used in baking.<br /><br />I will not be purchasing this coffee again.  My suggestion to those considering a purchase . . . buy something else."
negative,18/6/21,"I have a One:One Coffee Pod machine and have ordered pods online before.  These looked good and sounded like high quality coffee- albeit a little pricey for 12 pods.  This was the worst cup of coffee I have ever tasted!  It left a bitter taste in my mouth that lingered for hours.  Yuck!  Don't be fooled by the fancy name and packaging. It tastes like rocket fuel.  Fortunately, Amazon refunded my money when I explained how bad it was. Throwing the whole box away!"
positive,7/7/21,"Okay, so let me preface my review by saying that I don't drink hot chocolate that often and I'm from America and don't think I've ever had hot chocolate while traveling in Europe, BUT my husband is a British citizen who grew up in India with summers in England and he has searched HIGH and low for a chocolate drink that would remind him of those from his childhood.  We found it in this drink and he wont drink any other chocolate drink now (not even the 47 other kinds that are in my pantry that I bought for him to try and after 1 cup he turned his nose up at them... men)."
negative,18/6/21,"Having liked the various types of Ghirardelli chocolate and premium hot cocoa's I decided to try some Ghirardelli Chocolate Premium Hot Cocoa Mix, Chocolate Mocha. After trying several cups of this I started to wonder what happened to the Ghirardelli Chocolate as myself I thought it was overpowered with the coffee taste. Not my cup of hot cocoa!!"
positive,7/7/21,"Very good lemonade mix.  Close to fresh in taste.  Love that it has stevia.  I like it so much more than crystal light or any of the other mixes with artificial sweeteners.  I can take it anywhere, mix it in bottled water, and have a refreshing, healthy, safe, cool drink."
positive,1/7/21,"My wife has a difficult time getting enough iron, and supplements are very hard on her stomach.  With 70% of the USRDA of iron in one serving of this blackstrap molasses, she can very easily get the iron she needs.  This is not in any way hard on her stomach, either.  It tastes very good compared to other blackstraps we tried - a few have a slight edge on taste but none on iron content.  Blackstrap is an acquired taste but worth it for natural nutrients.  This definitely picked up her step within a very short time (she gets low energy and tired when she needs iron).  We will definitely be buying this again."
positive,7/7/21,"Wow, this tastes great, sweet and chocolaty! Like a liquid chocolate bar.<br /><br />Plus it is organic!<br /><br />It does contain high-glycemic cane juice, so I don't drink too much. The original and vanilla flavors are sweetened with low-glycemic rice syrup. They have less sugar. All are organic.<br /><br />I don't know why the ingredients here say canola oil. Neither the Good Karma website nor the label on the box has that ingredient. If I verified that this site is correct, and the Good Karma corporate website and the label on the carton are wrong, I would stop using the product. Perhaps this page has outdated ingredient information.<br /><br />This is the richest most milk-like rice beverage and the label on it does not mention canola oil, which contains up to 2% toxic erucic acid and is found in many rice beverages that are fed to children! Canola oil cannot be used by US FDA regulation in infant food. (One research paper found higher levels of erucic acid in red blood cells of autistic children compared to non-autistic children, and there are many other well established toxic effects of erucic acid in humans and animals. Look in the medical journals.)<br /><br />This product is sold in my neighborhood Ralph's (best price), VC discount, and Whole Foods in Los Angeles.<br /><br />The 365 brand (Whole Foods own brand) is also canola-free. It is much cheaper but watery in comparison. I use it for cooking. Only plain and vanilla flavors, though.<br /><br />West Soy Rice beverage is also canola free. It has a more neutral taste and less body. They have a chocolate flavor.<br /><br />Many people find rice milk better tasting than other milk substitutes. I find it to be much easier to digest than soy and nut products. Soy milk, however, has much more protein. Aside from being hard to digest, I don't eat too much soy because of the anti-nutritional components; so I get my protein elsewhere."
positive,23/7/21,"I've tried a bunch of them and the taste of this product is outstanding.  Even the folks behind the counter at my gym commented on it and they sell a competing product.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."
positive,20/7/21,"Great meal replacement drink that tastes great!  You get plenty of protein and other vital nutrients.  I prepare one of these whenever I'm on the go and I won't have to worry about missing a meal.  The best bang for your buck, especially if you subscribe to the Amazon subscribe and save program."
positive,19/7/21,"Listen if you want a good taste and hot. This the stuff! It won't melt your eyes out .but it is too hot to take straight . One dab will do ya on a bite of pizza!"
positive,18/6/21,"If you are the kind of guy who really enjoys a huge slab of bacon with your breakfast, not that wimpy kind of stuff they serve at a restaurant, but the kind that hunters grab when they are together, thick, with lots of fat in the middle, you WILL enjoy these! You can almost feel your cholesterol count go up as you bite into them.<br /><br />Now I must admit I am a wimpy, crispy kind of gal, and I like my bacon on the lean side, in fact with my allergies I have to use Morningstar Soy bacon (don't cringe!). So when I bit into these, I realized from the very first bite I was NOT their intended audience.<br /><br />Nope, these are not ""girl food."" They are man food. If you want to carry a bag of these out to serve to your fishing or hunting buds early in the morning, this is the perfect selection for you. However, you might want to consider the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBLAMK"">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Man Mix</a> for a selection, or the milder and tamer <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBO41E"">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler</a>. Both will give you a variety to try, just in case you don't like bacon as much as you think you do.<br /><br />I am grateful to have received samples of all of these from the company to try, and am basing my review on the samples which they sent. (Oh, I passed the rest of my bacon ones on to my guy buddies)."
positive,7/7/21,"This is a very tasty product.  This is my first time trying this, and I am glad I ordered it to see how it tastes.  As a product I'd order it again.<br /><br />One odd thing though that will cause me to lower this rating from 5 stars to 4 is that the listing here says a pound, but on the label 16 ounces is crossed out and 14 ounces is written next to it.  I didn't weigh the container to confirm this, but if it is 14 ounces, then then they need to update their listing to show such.<br /><br />Since I consider shipping to not be part of a product review I won't lower my star rating for this, and consider this to be just a mention of this then but the shipping was SLOW.  I ordered it on June 20th.  A USPS tracking/delivery confirmation number was generated on the 21st to be fair, but it took until July 5th for me to get this.  Even taking into account that there was a major holiday July 4th, that just seems too slow.  Everything was packaged well enough (although without anything like a ""blue ice"" pack to keep it cold for summer shipping...) but just took a long time to get here.  I do suspect the order wasn't truly shipped until the week before the July 4th weekend, despite a tracking number being generated on June 21st."
negative,27/6/21,"It tastes like Jack Links brand, not Wild Bill's.  Even the texture is totally different from Wild Bill's.  Not recommended!"
positive,21/7/21,"I grew up in Southern California, so I've had my share of sweet corn cakes at local restaurants. This mix is a great way to make these at home. I prepared a package of these for a friend of mine (who lives on the east coast and had never tried a corn cake)....she's now addicted but can't find them at her local store. Thank goodness for Amazon!"
positive,18/6/21,"Over the past two years, thanks to Amazon, I have been sampling jerky from literally all over the U.S. I finally found a tasty, jerky that doesn't give my jawbone a workout. Great meat flavor, an excellent snack."
negative,7/7/21,"These little taffy's are expensive. I think I paid around $11 for the pound. They taste good, but man do they give me gas. After eating about 3 my stomach would be rumbling for a few hours and I would have to pass gas a lot. My girlfriend wouldn't let me eat them before bed hahaha. There was never any pain involved, just gas. I know it was these doing it because we tested it over a few different days. I wouldn't eat the taffy some days and would be fine.

positive,1/7/21,"I just love skittles! For a while we had them here in Brazil (South America), but then for some reason I couldn't find them anymore, so when my aunt is coming down for a visit I ask her to bring me some. This time I decided to spare her the shopping trouble and I bought it through Amazon and had it sent to her place. The bag was a bit larger than I expected, but I guess this was a good thing, right?"
positive,24/8/21,"I ordered these because I couldnt seem to find this size at the store. There were a couple skittle shells at the bottom of the bag from the shipping of the product, but everything else was fine."
positive,21/7/21,"I actually tasted the Berry/Vanilla flavor.  If you've ever eaten a fig newton, then try to imagine a fig newton, minus the fig center, with rice crispies mixed up in it.  It tastes a little grainy at first, but once I read the ingredients and realized that the grains were puffed rice, I was more at ease.  Really a good taste.  One of the better gluten free/casien free/egg free cookies I've eaten."
negative,25/6/21,"I purchased these because they do not contain dairy, soy or corn.  Well, in addition to being dairy free, soy free.... they are FLAVOR FREE!  Absolutely horrible dry tasting bars.  First words out of my mouth were ""tastes like dirt"" so that's what I'm going with.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
positive,13/9/21,"No matter how wholesome a snack may be, it's worthless unless the girls approve. In this case they both give the Science Diet Jerky Treats two paws up. I like that beef is the first ingredient in the recipe and there are none of those unrecognizable ingredients created in a science laboratory.<br /><br />The treats are a nice size and have just enough chew to satisfy. For Piper, our shih tzu with a few missing teeth, I break the treats into smaller pieces so she can manage them.<br /><br /> On the package:<br />Use within 3 weeks of opening.<br />100% satisfaction guaranteed<br />Keep this bag out of the reach of pets and children."
positive,18/6/21,I was amazed at the actual taste of this product . . . the amount of protein and the lack of fat is really good.  They have a lot more flavors and all of the combinations are really good.
positive,7/7/21,"Great taste. There is a slight bitterness to this tea, but it's black tea - it's bound to be a little bitter, especially for being so strong. The strength is perfect for customizing to taste. Some people like strong tea while others like theirs very mild, so you can add more water if you want. I like to make a fairly strong tea (the melting ice dilutes it just fine) and sweeten it myself. I like sweet tea, but usually when I get it, it just tastes like sugar water. These give me the strong tea flavor I love, and I can add the perfect amount of sweetness. Great product!"
positive,15/7/21,"I ordered this assorted bartons turkish delight 6in1 it is delicious .I took it to my parents house for my sister's birthday among her gifts which I also bought at amazon everyone at the party loved this Turkish delight so much they even wanted to buy it for them and I told them amazon go there they have everything,amazon thank you as allways bringing us International flavors without leaving our homes."
positive,11/7/21,"I ordered these to use for marathon training. I have a sensitive stomach,but have had no problems with these. They do give me energy during those long runs!"
positive,7/10/21,I tasted a few of these and they are pretty good.  I was expecting something a bit flavorless and I can imagine happily snacking on these for a multi-day packing hike.  I will write more after I have taken them on the trail.
positive,6/7/21,Stingers are better tasting and more convenient than gels and work just as well to provide energy when exercising over long periods of time.
positive,18/6/21,"I was excited to try these little honey chews to help with my energy levels during exercising and running.  I am 60 years old and about 50 pounds overweight.  I find it hard to keep my energy up day after day while running and exercising.  First of all these are so tasty without being overly sugary.  I was surprised though to see that the ingredients weren't mostly honey and the first ingredient listed which is suppose to be what the item has the most of is tapioca syrup.  I guess with the package calling it honey stinger I was thinking that it was pure honey with some taste enhancers.  Still, everything is organic which I suppose should add to it's value.  I found that I felt no energy boost during my activities but I can say that without a doubt that these make you feel like you can keep going and going.  It's not something that feels like you are really energetic but more like you just got a good days rest and are ready to get going.  I don't like feeling like I'm on a sugar high with that nervous feeling in my chest and these do not do that.  I think they make you feel healthy and are a good addition to your diet for exercising.  The only drawback to me is the cost of these $16 for 12 bags makes it hard to justify the purchase as often as you would like to have them.  I will purchase again when my grocery money allows.  I would recommend to buy if you are looking for a healthy pickup to keep you going all day and not just for a quick boost."
positive,7/7/21,"I didn't want caffeine, don't want the high calories & went through MANY types of energy chews / gels / drinks online to see what would be the best option for myself.<br /><br />I LOVE the honey stingers!  No caffeine, calories can be controlled depending on how many pieces you take, and most importantly, it lasted me through my marathon trainings :)<br /><br />Fruit smoothy is delicious.  Haven't tried the other flavors."
positive,27/7/21,"This tastes great and I like that it's more natural than most other sodas available. Basically, it's a carbonated juice.  I generally prefer a larger 12 oz. size though."
positive,13/7/21,I like the taste of this drink in many ways it takes me back to my childhood with the orange ice lollies I used to eat as it has a similar flavour. The thing you should be aware of is that although it has no added sugar because it has so much fruit juice it does have a lot of calories.  I also found that the can needed to be bigger as I wanted more at the end!
positive,13/9/21,"I put my Orange Switch in the refrigerator overnight to make it nice and cold, and I had it with breakfast.  I love the taste of it - mostly orange, with a hint of carbonation.  It tastes sweet naturally and I'm sure it's good for you.  I would buy this product  :-)"
positive,7/9/21,"This is a very refreshing carbonated juice drink with no aftertaste.  I love the flavor and the fact that there is no added sugar.  It's more subtle than orange so really kills a thirst.  The size is perfect for times when you don't really want a 12 ounce drink."
positive,17/4/21,"I _really_ like this drink.  My only complaint is that I'd need to drink 2-3 cans at a time -- 8.3oz is a wee bit on the petite side for me.<br /><br />If it came in a 20oz can, I'd be much more likely to buy it, and the packaging would be much less costly.<br /><br />Really tasty product, though, and I've got no quarrels with the ingredients.  Yum."
positive,10/3/21,"This is almost the kind of fruit soda I'd make if I were going into this business. The difference is that I'd go the Odwalla route and not use reconstituted juice concentrate and only use orange/tangerine juices. Since it's a carbonated beverage I'd probably use a stabilizer too so it wouldn't have to be shaken before drinking. That would result in a higher price, though not sure how much higher than the almost $1/can price it's being offered as a grocery item (imagine the price in a vending machine).<br /><br />For this product the first ingredient is apple juice and the second is grape juice, then comes the tangerine and orange juice and finally acerola juice (a fruit high in Vitamin C and apparently popular in Puerto Rico and Barbados).  There's acacia gum (as a stabilizer probably, don't want to have to shake a carbonated drink) and then additional natural colors and flavors, ascorbic acid and soy.<br /><br />My 13yo daughter and I shared a can and liked the taste.  On a par with Orangina. My personal preference would be for a little more carbonation, but this was ok. I'm a traditionalist so I definitely prefer a 12oz. can, the quantity at this price makes me feel a little ripped, but then, I prefer to make my own lemonade in the blender adding in some raspberries or strawberries or mint to vary the flavor.  Cheers!"
negative,17/4/21,"In proportion this drink is about equal to a regular soda in calories and sugar content, but I would prefer a regular soda than this stuff. There is a slight citrus taste, but mainly from acidity and a horrible after taste of metal and sickly sweetness that lingers for several minutes after wards.<br /><br />Soda water with natural juice should be a refreshing, pleasant, and nice refreshment, but none of these traits are in this drink.<br /><br />I would be embarrassed to serve this beverage to anyone I liked for any occasion, but would consider giving it to people I really didn't care for to see their reaction.<br /><br />Avoid this one. Orange Crush or a different orange soda diluted with soda water would taste far better or soda water and regular orange juice would also be a treat that puts this nasty stuff to shame."
positive,21/1/21,"I don't know how to describe 'Switch Orange Tangerine' without sounding like a cliche advertising slogan, but the truth is it REALLY IS very refreshing.  Just the right amount of carbonation too.  This stuff tastes like what you would get if you squeezed part tangerine and part orange and then poured in a bit of sparkling soda.  Very fresh tasting.  Not too sweet at all.  The label says there is no sugar added.  Fine, as it doesnt need any.  The label also says it has Apple and Grape juice. I taste mostly the tangerine myself but you may find your mileage varies.  Finally, it is supposed to give you a full days worth of vitamin C.  Ok,a LOT of drinks can do that nowdays, but without any refined sugar of high fructose corn syrup? (or artificial sweetener?)  I could totally see replacing my orange soda with this stuff.  I have not seen this in the market yet, but I would be willing to try other flavors and add Switch to the many beverages I enjoy.  Really, for a fruit drink, it is pretty darn good!"
positive,30/1/21,"There's nothing wrong with this drink, but it really just tastes like any other orange soda.  Kudos to The Switch for not adding artificial flavors, sugar, or corn syrup, though.  It tastes pretty clean and refreshing, but a bit expensive for what it is.<br /><br />Don't let the small-sized can (8.3oz) fool you, this isn't an energy drink, it's just an orange soda."
negative,13/2/21,"If you like Orange Crush you may become a fan, but it's too much of a hybrid for me. The main two ingredients are reconstituted apple and grape juices. It contains something called Acerola juice, which is high in Vitamin C (and indeed the can contains 100% of your C and 20% of your A).<br /><br />The sugar content is high---34 grams---which brings the carb percentage up to 12% for the day and the calorie count to 140. I think it tastes too acidic for anyone who is watching carbs and calories to be willing to ""spend"" them on Switch, which almost tastes like carbonated TANG.  I've tried the Ooba drinks, and they are much lighter and more refreshing. Guess I'm just not ready to make the Switch!"
positive,15/1/21,"If you're a regular drinker of orange soda-pop, you might like this Switch orange tangerine carbonated juice beverage.  I thought the flavor was very good and appreciated that it was only mildly carbonated, not so fizzy that I had gas after drinking it.  At 140 calories per small serving, however, this isn't something I would regularly drink.  It's much healthier to eat whole fruit since it's more filling that simply drinking the extracted juice, in part because of the fiber associated with eating whole foods.  Still, this is a healthier option for those who regularly drink sugared sodas."
positive,6/3/21,"This is a wonderfully refreshing citrus drink.  Not too sweet or too sour & just enough bubbles to make it sparkle.  I would imagine it could make a great addition to a punch, if you chose to add it to your favorite fruit juice.  The only draw back for me, is that it is a tad bit too expencive to replace our families normal beverage of choice but it sure does make a terrific treat to keep around for an occational indulgence."
positive,8/6/21,"I enjoyed the flavor of this orange soda.  It was not overly sweet and the orange flavor had just enough tartness to it.  I am glad it does not have any HFCS in it, but the calorie count is still quite high from the natural sugars.  All in all, if you are looking for a good orange soda, try this one."
negative,7/1/21,"The product may be every bit as healthy as they claim, but even if that's true, I could barley get down one can of this stuff.  It tastes like sour orange juice with some carbonation in it.  It doesn't taste anything like orange soda, and the taste it does have isn't very pleasant.  Also leaves a very nasty aftertaste, and like many sodas, this will leave you more thirsty than when you started drinking.  All in all, I cannot recommend this.  Stay away."
negative,17/4/21,"I expected to like this drink because I like various fruit juices and I like carbonated beverages, as well.  Unfortunately, I just did not like the consistency or the taste of this drink. It was thick, had very little bubbly carbonation and, for me anyway, there was a very unpleasant aftertaste that lasted a loooong time.  I finally brushed my teeth really well and used some strong mouthwash to get rid of the taste in my mouth."
positive,10/3/21,"I really liked the tatste of this.  It actually tastes like you're getting the juice from a tangerine...I think the carbonation gives it that zing taste you can only get biting into an tangerine, orange, etc.<br />My daughter, however, really didn't like it.  Not sweet enough for her.<br />I think it's a little pricey, not sure I'd be willing to plunk down that much for it~~the can is very small, 8.3 fl. ozs., which is a proper serving of orange juice, which makes it around $1 a can, or a little less.<br />But overall I truly enjoyed that zinging tangerine taste!!"
negative,14/1/21,"This is for sure not what I was expecting it to taste like. It's not bad but not for me. I like the carbonation and juice idea with no added sugar. When I first took a sip of it I noticed it has a bite to it. The best way I can describe it is a non alcoholic champagne. I however did like it better than the watermelon but still not for me."
positive,24/5/21,"This relatively expensive convenience-packaged item is 100 percent juice and contains 140 calories worth of concentrated apple, grape, tangerine, orange, and acerola juice reconstituted with carbonated water; acacia gum; some soy; and added vitamin C to provide 100 percent of the adult minimum daily requirement. There are no artificial flavors or additives which allows the manufacturer to describe this as a ""natural"" beverage.<br /><br />I often mix juice with seltzer water, and I like the combination quite cold. The Switch Orange Tangerine tasted more like orange soda with a tangerine chaser than what I am used to as juice flavor.<br /><br />The carbonation makes the drink seem lighter than juice, but not as light and refreshing to the mouth as juice and seltzer.<br /><br />The tangerine flavor made the taste seem more appealing than orange soda, but the orange and tangerine flavors don't last as long as soda flavors do on the palate.<br /><br />I would drink this again on a hot day if I could buy it inexpensively enough."
negative,14/10/21,"My daughter & I were excited about trying this flavor as we both love orange juice.  This product did not impress us enough to order it as we liked other flavors more. My son also tried it and didn't care for it. The orange tangerine flavors are masked by the other fruit juices and makes it taste odd.  I like the fact that has added Vitamin C and is a healthy alternative to sodas but the flavor on this one needs tweaking."
negative,7/2/21,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this citrusy, fizzy drink. It was okay, though not something I'd buy often, and certainly not worth the price in my opinion.<br /><br />It wasn't as orangey as I expected and it wasn't until I had half of it gone that I read the ingredient list and saw why--orange juice is actually the fourth juice listed on the ingredient list, with apple and grape juice first and second, and the tangerine that seems to tone down the sweetness slightly the third on the list.<br /><br />When you look at the nutrition information, this product has about forty more calories than Coke Classic, and despite not having any *added* sugar, the grams of sugar in this product is MORE than an equivalent amount of Coca-Cola!! The only bonus of this over ""real"" soda is the Vitamin C and A...there isn't much else nutritionally to speak of."
positive,29/3/21,"The can size is like a Redbull drink's.  However, its sugar content is 34 grams.  Attached is a photo of the nutrional facts.<br /><br />In terms of its taste, in my opinion, it's quite tasty, sweet, a bit tangy and very orangish!"
negative,17/4/21,The product says a twist because of carbonation. Well after pouring the drink over 3 pieces of ice the carbonation was gone.  The carbonation is definitely light and does not last.<br /><br />As far as the taste goes I did not care for the taste at all. It left a bad after taste in my mouth I cannot recommend this product. I will stick with regular juice at a much lower cost.<br /><br />To be fair I gave it two stars because my wife thought it was OK.
positive,10/3/21,"I like orange soda but usually cannot drink an entire can or bottle of Sunkist or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00168A9KG"">Orange Crush Case 4-6pk</a> because they are so sickly sweet. This has just the right touch of natural sweetness, and the tangerine gives a nice little tang to the orange flavor. Reminds me of the great orange sodas you can get in Europe or specialty shops, like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GN4OHK"">Orangina Sparkling Citrus Beverage with Natural Pulp - 24 Cans</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FQUCG"">San Pellegrino Aranciata 6 pack - 6oz bottles</a>.<br /><br />Dare I say it? Yes. The flavor and size make it a perfect mixer. After my intial sip, I immediately thought it would be great to fill up the rest of the glass with vodka."
negative,10/7/21,"I was offered the opportunity to taste this product because of Vine. I would not normally purchase this type of product, so my review and opinion will be biased in that regard.<br /><br />I'm not a big soda drinker, I'd just rather drink water or coffee. I will occasionally drink a diet soft drink, usually Diet Pepsi or Diet Coke.<br /><br />Did you know that a single 12oz can of Coke Classic¬Æ has 140 calories and 39 grams of sugar? This 8oz can of Switch has 140 calories and 34grams of sugar. And this is healthy? 4 ounces less is size, same caloric content and more sugar per ounce that Classic Coke. OK, so it's not ""added"" sugar, but still, that's a lot of sugar. 100% Orange juice, 8 oz, has 120 calories and 28 grams of sugar.<br /><br />The can says it is ""Orange Tangerine"" but in fact the contents are #1: Water #2: Concentrates of Apple, Grape, Tangerine, Orange, and Acerola juices. Then they throw in some ""gum acacia"", ""natural flavors and colors"" and some ""ascorbic acid(vitamin C)"". And as a little surprise bonus, they have added ""soy"". Soy?<br /><br />I asked my wife to taste this product with me. I poured the drink into two glasses and we both took a sip. Her reaction was swift and strong... she hated it. I agreed with her. It was for me, sickly sweet and left a sugary aftertaste in my mouth. Not only that, but the taste was just nasty. It didn't taste at all like orange or tangerine to me. It just tasted terribly sweet with an undefined cirtus something taste. The carbonation did not add anything positive to the experience. Neither of us finished drinking our 4oz portion. It went down the sink.<br /><br />I would not purchase this product in the future and if I could have given it 0-stars, I would have. It's that bad."
positive,27/1/21,"If you want a quick pick me up that is not full of added sugar, then this is a refreshing alternative to a soda. The flavor is more heavily tangerine (which only makes sense). It isn't overly sweet, which is a good thing."
positive,1/6/21,"I sampled a can of Switch Orange Tangerine and found it to be a tasty beverage. As advertised, it is a ""...balance between juice and carbonated"" with a light carbonation so it doesn't taste like Orange Crush or Fanta but not like orange Gatorade either. The 8.3 oz can has 140 calories, with a 12% DV carb/sugar content but 100% Vitamin C and 20% Vit A. It's marketed as ""100% juice"" coming mostly from filtered concentrates. No sugar added, no corn syrup, no preservatives, no artificial colors, gluten free, if you're concerned with all that. Most important is that it tastes good and I would try it again."
positive,20/8/21,"I'll admit that I don't care for drinks that are carbonated - the carbonation in soda makes me burp, they tend to be too sweet, or the diet drinks have a weird taste to them. So I wasn't sure what to expect when I drank this.<br /><br />To my surprise, the carbonation is very mild - it's more like a light buzz in your mouth instead of a lot of carbonation (you won't hear the contents fizz when you drink this stuff). The orange tangerine flavor is a nice combo  - stronger in the tangerine flavor than orange, though as someone who doesn't like any sugar in my drinks, I found it to be a tad sweet (though it is advertised as no sugar added), but less than I expected.<br /><br />I'm not sure when you would drink this though - it's a small can and I can't imagine someone who drinks cans of soda drinking one of these instead - especially at the price they charge for this. Are they thinking that this will replace a glass of orange juice first thing in the morning?<br /><br />Overall I think it's tasty and if someone offered me one, I'd take it, but it's not something I would buy."
positive,14/8/21,"This is a mix of apple, grape, tangerine, orange, and acerola juices.<br /><br />Taste is obviously subjective and that can be seen in the reviews. I like the flavor but will try to describe it rather than raving or ranting about it.<br /><br />The tangerine is the dominant flavor. However it is the taste of a very ripe tangerine or, perhaps, a clementine. There is that slight alcohol or medicinal overtone to an otherwise good flavor. I could see people not liking it while other do.<br /><br />Each can has 34 grams of sugar, 100 vitamin C, and 20% vitamin A and not much else. These aren't nutrients that are otherwise hard to get so this isn't necessarily a healthy alternative to regular soda. On some level (e.g. producing fruit instead of sugar cane) it might be attractive to some."
positive,21/4/21,"As part of Amazon's Vine Program I received two trial cans of The Switch, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E"">Black Cherry</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O"">Orange Tangerine</a>. I tried both flavors cold (over ice) and rated them 4 stars each, although I prefer the Orange Tangerine flavor to the Black Cherry.<br /><br />Whether or not The Switch is just right or not sweet enough for you will depend on your personal experience with carbonated juice drinks and soda. If you are looking for the sweetness and fizz of a diet soda you will be disappointed. These are 100% juice drinks. The Orange Tangerine flavor has 140 calories and the Black Cherry has 130 calories.<br /><br />I recommend them as an alternative to regular juice to liven up your lunch or help you refuel after a workout. Either way, you are getting 100% of your Vitamin C and there's no added sugar or corn syrup, no preservatives and no artifical colors.<br /><br />The Black Cherry flavor was too mild for me. I was looking for more bite. I could taste hints of the apple, grape and acerola juice concentrates in the blend. The flavor reminded me of blends I've tasted from Treetop. Again, The Switch has a lot less carbonation than you would find in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXYW"">Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Blackberry Juice</a>, for example.<br /><br />The Orange Tangerine flavor should be renamed the Tangerine Orange flavor to reflect the dominate taste and aroma. The Switch's blend is as flavorful as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BDHBWQ"">essn Sparkling Minneola Tangerine Juice</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L4EME4"">San Pellegrino Orange</a> although, again, it is no where near as carbonated as those other brands.<br /><br />In summary, these all natural, 100% juice drinks are a healthier option than drinking a soda. The Switch also can help break up the monotony of drinking plain water and/or juice after a workout. Remember to keep them the cans ice cold, though. Preferably, serve them on the rocks.<br /><br />BTW: If you are looking for a full-flavored Black Cherry soda, try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P9GB4Y"">Thomas Kemper Black Cherry Soda</a>, which has 170 calories per bottle. There's a low calorie (10) version as well but it isn't available on Amazon."
positive,1/4/21,"I love the taste of this soda. It's sweet with no bitter aftertaste that can be found in some orange sodas. I'd never guess this was a natural drink from the taste alone.<br /><br />My only complaint would be the serving size. It's correct for a serving size but not what I'm used to in a soda can. (12 oz.)"
positive,17/4/21,"The Switch is marketed as ""100% of what you want, 0% of what you don't""...meaning, the only things in the can are juice and carbonation. There is no added sugar, no corn syrup (high fructose or otherwise), no preservatives, no *artificial* colors (""natural"" flavors and colors ARE added), and no gluten.<br /><br />The Orange-Tangerine flavor seemed to taste almost like carbonated Sunny Delight - according to the label, the juice flavors are apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola. It was quite tasty and had just the right amount of carbonation - almost like a soda that has been opened and left to sit for just a few minutes to let some of the excess gas escape. It was light and, dare I say, refreshing. For what it is marketed to be, it does quite well.<br /><br />The only downside is that I could probably do something similar at home - buy some Sunny D and add some sparkling water or seltzer, and it would probably be cheaper. However, if you're out-and-about and need something light, tasty and not loaded full of extra nonsense, then this would certainly fit the bill."
negative,10/3/21,"I drank a single can of the Switch Orange Tangerine flavor today.  Upon first impression, the physical size of the can is a tiny -- 8oz or 250ml.  This in contrast to a regular can of soda size which is 12 ounces or 355 ml.  Therefore, only about 2/3 the content of a normal can of soda.  To say the least, this isn't enough liquid for me in one sitting.  I need more to drink than that to quench a tiny bit of thirst so I was quite disappointed without even opening the thing up.<br /><br />The taste of the drink itself was satisfying.  Since there is no added sugar (which is usually corn syrup in the US) the flavor was not too sweet nor was it too bland.  However, it wasn't anything like drinking a fresh bottle of 100% natural juice.  More on the side of mixed syrup with water.<br /><br />What kills this product is the high price.  Product right now comes out to about a buck a can.  I would be angry paying that out of a vending machine for its small size but for purchasing in bulk, it is an insult to say the least.  Not worth the money."
positive,22/4/21,"I drank this and could tell very little difference from a regular orange/tangerine flavored soda, which is quite impressive considering that this drink is made from 100% juice!  It has 140 calories and a great alternative to a regular soda.  I will definitely be purchasing these in the future!  I also tried their Kiwi Strawberry carbonated juice and enjoyed it as well."
negative,25/4/21,"This is not orange and tangerine juice; it's mainly apple and grape juice flavored with orange and tangerine. And I really don't care about the vitamin C content; vitamin C is easy to get.<br /><br />What I do care about is that this is definitely the worst-tasting soda of any type that I have ever tried. I couldn't pour it down the drain fast enough."
positive,1/4/21,"I realize that it is not quite healthy to guzzle 12-16 oz. canisters of liquid at a sitting, but this Switch Orange Tangerine flavored drink was so light and refreshing, and tasted so natural, that I could easily have downed another 8.3 oz can - or two. And that is the only reason this drink did not receive five stars - I wanted more and the little can was just not enough! It is the perfect size for a child, however - so perhaps that who the drink is targeted for. As an aside for those who prefer their beverages more adult-oriented, this Orange Tangerine Switch would make an awesome mixer with gin or vodka - cheers!"
positive,30/6/21,I tried the Black Cherry version and liked it but this one is much better.  Great orange taste plus the benefit of juice.  And no corn syrup sweetner for those worried about its use.  The carbonation helps make it a satisfying drink to quench thirst and the knowledge that it is healthy satisfies the mind as well.
negative,1/3/21,"The Switch Orange Tangerine looked very promising. 100% juice, with some zippy carbonation. I placed it in the fridge, and let it get a nice chill. Hours later, I popped the top, and my wife and I sampled...<br /><br />And it tasted like drinking furniture polish. It's not like we we're searching for derogatory statements about Switch. Here is how the conversation went:<br /><br />Wife takes a swig, looks at me with eyes all googled. ""Yuck. It tastes like furniture polish.""<br /><br />I take the can from her, thinking she must be insane. I chug some down. ""Ah, yeah...it does taste like furniture polish.""<br /><br />We poured the remainder down the drain. If you enjoy drinking cold tangerine flavored furniture polish, by all means...<br /><br />BTW, this drink left a nasty aftertaste...still belching it up."
positive,29/1/21,"These 8.3 oz cans of Switch keep their promise. There are no added sugar, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. It is a carbonated all natural 100% juice. Like most of these `juices drinks' the ingredients state 100% Juice in this order; Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, (Apple, Grape, Tangerine, Orange, and Acerola Juice Concentrates), Gum Acaia, Natural Flavors and colors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) and Soy. I was very surprised that this taste like a great Tangerine soda. Each can has 140 calories, 1orNo thanks I am  swimming from 15 mg of sodium, 34g of carbohydrates, 34g of sugar and 100% of RDA of Vitamin C and 20 % of Vitamin A.<br /><br />I would be pleased to drink this sparkling orange/Tangerine flavored juice again. I found it to taste good and be a refreshing drink. But for my money I would rather by the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C"">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> brand of fortified sparkling juice that has a cleaner taste and fewer calories."
positive,17/4/21,"I'm always on the lookout for soda's that are made using real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup and fruit juice instead of chemicals. Switch's ingredients are: Filtered Water, apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola juice concentrates, gum acacia, natural flavors and colors and ascorbic acid (Vitamin C). It also says it contains soy so avoid it if you are allergic to soy. One can contains 100% Vitamin C and 20% Vitamin A. It also contains 34 grams of sugar and it tastes like it.<br /><br />The taste of Switch is very similar to regular orange soda which includes the syrupy taste that orange soda has. I personally don't like the syrupy taste and think this is way too sweet. I can see kid's liking the taste however and it is a much better alternative to regular orange soda. 34 grams of sugar is a lot for 8.3 ounces of a drink. I would avoid it for myself but may use it as an occasional substitute for my kids."
negative,10/3/21,"Switch tastes more like chemicals than juice. I was expecting something along the lines of Orangina, instead it's closer to orange soda but without the carbonation level that makes orange soda enjoyable. For a small drink (8.3 oz), it's pretty high in calories (140). Frankly, I don't think the flavor is good enough to justify the caloric level.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you're die-hard soda drinker, this might be a better option for you. If you're a die-hard juice drinker, stick to juice. If you want fizzy juice, add a little seltzer to your fruit juice."
positive,30/5/21,"This orange tangerine juice bills itself as having ""100% of what you want"" and ""0% of what you don't want."" It is pure orange and tangerine juice with a bit of carbonation, but no added sugar, preservatives and carbonation.<br /><br />Of course, that's all great, but the big question is how it tastes. I'm pleased to be able to say it tastes pretty good. It has a bit less zip than I usually prefer in my orange soda, but a nice orange / tangerine flavor and no noticeable aftertaste. I would definitely try this again if I had the chance."
negative,28/9/21,"8.3 ounces and a tad expensive is what I'd say about this drink.34 grams of sugar is also a negative for me. I'm not a sugar lover. All in all not big enough to quench my thirst,and not delicious enough to find me coming back for more.Natural but not that intensely citrus."
positive,6/5/21,I really enjoyed this drink. The tangerine is very present and makes it very tasty. This drink is 100% natural and has no sugar added. The carbonation makes it a bit like a soda but a lighter and healthier one.<br /><br />I enjoyed it and I would definitely recommend it to others as an excellent alternative to regular soda.
negative,20/4/21,"The only good thing was that it was not sweet, but the taste was just bad. I could understand and tolerate the taste if it was an energy drink, but this is not an energy drink.  I have been very open and have tried different carbonated orange drinks, and I have to say this is the least favorites of the 9 other carbonated orange drinks.  I prefer just mixing carbonated water with orange juice."
positive,20/4/21,"I'm a big fan of avoiding corn syrup and a lot of the other ingredients that go into most processed foods and beverages these days, so this beverage idea really sounded good to me.  It doesn't contain a bunch of artificial junk in it, and it still tastes pretty good.  I could definitely drink more of these.  They won't ever be my favorite beverage, but then I'm more of a non-carbonated kind of drinker anyway.  This is definitely a good alternative to other products out there, and I'd like to try other flavors as well."
positive,21/4/21,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this, but upon tasting it (very chilled), I have to admit, it's pretty darn tasty!<br /><br />To give you an idea of what it tastes like:  Take orange juice.  Give it the familiar ""bite"" of your favorite carbonated beverage.  Add a little tangerine for a slight citrus aftertaste, and there you go.  Basically, it looks and smells like orange juice, but it tastes like orange pop *should* taste, if it really tasted like oranges.  My wife said it reminded her of Minute Maid orange pop (or, as she would call it, orange *soda*).<br /><br />Our four-year-old son is eager to drink pop because he sees mom and dad do it occassionally, but we generally don't let him.  After reading the nutritional information on the can and seeing that there's no added sugar, corn syrup, preservatives, or artificial flavors, I can admit that I would have no problem letting him drink this instead of juice occassionally (but not *too* often, as it is quite a bit of sugar!).<br /><br />My wife made the observation that this drink would probably make a fantastic mixer for adult beverages.  Sadly, the sample we received was not enough to test this theory, but it should make a really, really good screwdriver."
positive,2/5/21,"Firstly, I hate orange flavored sodas. They all taste like ultra-fake chemical laden floor cleaner to me.  Switch is definitely NOT the case.  Finally an orange soda that tastes like real oranges and tangerines- who knew!  I thoroughly enjoyed this fizzy delight, which reminded me of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E3HLX6"">San Pellegrino Aranciata Sparking Beverage - 24/11.5 oz cans</a> but sweeter.  This, and ALL Switch beverages are highly recommended."
positive,25/5/21,"Lana's Snowflake Black Tea with Coconut and Almond has now become my favorite tea. First the smoothness is unbeatable. I found it a bit smoother than the Hanley Vanilla cormoro! Secondly,the aroma changes from the time you smell it in the bag and then brew, it is a great experience. When you taste it you have a wonderful surprise of sweetness and comfort. Sort of a nutty, caramel with vanilla notes, it is the PERFECT Dessert tea. My husband lost 18 lbs by drinking this instead of having ice cream! Now when you present it to friends,let them taste it first. If they go by the  intense aroma in the bag, it is so fresh some  have wrongly thought it was too strong a flavor, but it is not. It is the amazing  freshness they are not used to.  We served this at our wedding vow renewal and it beat out hanleys vanilla cormoro and Paris too.  This tea has filled a gap I have had in my collection, I have searched for a flavor like this over 3 years!!<br />Lana Please keep on creating this tea, I am definitely coming back for more.<br />And thank you for tremendous and fast service... btw, i am sipping this as i write.. YUM!<br />smiles, grace in VT"
positive,7/9/21,"Since Swanson's Sun Butter only contains roasted Sunflower Seeds and no other ingredients, it is the only nut butter product we buy!"
positive,25/5/21,Just received this butter yesterday and we are already using it to make sandwiches with jelly. Tastes great without having any salt or sugar added. Highly recommend!
positive,22/5/21,"This stuff is great!!!!! I'm allergic to peanuts ( just happened over night ) and I miss having a PBJ, so this is the next best thing to it. :-) Truly, this butter is all that and then some...."
positive,19/7/21,"I really like the fruity taste of this tea - so much so that I can actually drink it without sugar.  If you like fruity teas, you should try this product."
negative,7/9/21,"I almost never write reviews, but I thought I would for this one.  I'm pretty open to tastes of anything, but something about the smell and taste of this product was really bad.  It tasted ""off"" almost.  I'm really disappointed because I had hoped to like it and I love fruity green teas, but this was NO GOOD.  I'd strongly recommend trying a sample of this (if possible) before buying.  Sorry Zhena's.... maybe I'll like another flavor.  I haven't given up on you yet."
positive,25/8/21,My vodka tonics have never been so refreshing.  I wish I would have ordered two cases now as my husband and I are going through far too much.
positive,6/9/21,"This is by far the best tasting thing that's come from a goat in years! Bullsburg Creamery, Man Chowder Dairy or Goat Coat can't hold a candle to this stuff. Drink it, bake it, snort it...it's all good."
positive,25/5/21,"chrysanthemum tea taste great with lemons and Apriva. chrysanthemum tea is caffeine free that's great for pregnant women and those with high blood pressure."
positive,7/9/21,"For coffee drinkers who buy Maxwell House coffee, this is a deal!  Buy two cases for just over $50!  Free shipping, too!  Seriously, you know I stocked up!"
positive,13/10/21,"Great product!<br /><br />I purchased this product from our local Fresh Market. I am a vegan and am always looking for different ""meat"" substitutes to try. I used this mix to make some taco mince. This stuff was perfect! I even got my non veg. father to try a bite of the tacos and he thought they were good as well. That right there is saying something, because my father is really iffy about mock meats.<br /><br />I have another packet in which I am going to cook up today!"
negative,2/10/21,"I tried many teas and thought would try this kind. Saw it on Dr. OZ show. Didn't like its taste."
negative,23/9/21,"I do not like sour taste and this has a sour kind of taste which i don't like. The smell isn't that great either"
positive,26/6/21,"I love to make sun tea with these tea bags, it is very nice on a hot day to sit with a chilled glass. It is tasty and not too sweet, highly recommended!"
negative,25/5/21,"Tasteless, basically says it all.  I love tea.  Drink it every day.  I found this undrinkable.  Great packaging, but not a good tea for me."
negative,7/9/21,"I bought this tea cause I had consumed the one from the bottle and I like that one.<br />However in tea bag is not just tasting totally and completely different, but additionally tastes really<br />horrible... believe me, I even tried to give it to my co workers for free after they tried it and they did not accept it.<br />In my opinion It tasted like Serum :s. Now I have 100 tea bags wasting space, probably soon they'll go to the waste bascket.<br /><br />It's sad... I thought it would taste like the bottle or at least close, but totally a disappointment."
positive,15/7/21,"I went to a gourmet store and asked for their ""Chocolate Expert"" to recommend a chocolate among the high-end makers.  He pointed out this brand, which was affordable as well as incredibly flavorful.  If you need a chocolate to melt in your mouth, savor the Santander 53% cocoa."
negative,3/6/21,"In court, as I understand it, you're not supposed to testify about anything where you don't have direct experience.  You can discount this review if you want, since I have only second hand experience with this soup.<br /><br />I gave a case of this soup to a young friend who is a college student (I worry about her starving).  She never mentioned whether she liked the soup, so I asked.  She finally admitted that it was, to quote her, ""The worst thing I've ever tasted"".  Apparently her boyfriend also tried it and thought it was bad as well.  While my friend is rather picky, her boyfriend has a much wider culinary range, so if they both disliked the soup, I'm inclinded to think it's not very good."
positive,27/9/21,"As far as noodles in a cup goes this is one of the best I've had. Actual recognizable small chunks of dehydrated veggies, mostly mushrooms and onions that I could make out. Descent noodle quality and a very hot and spicy seasoning mix. They don't show it on the picture here but I'm pretty sure this is the hot and spicy cup. It looks exactly like the one I just had but the words 'hot and spicy' are just to the left of the symbol and are not visible in the pic. If you like spicy noodles definitely don't pass this up.<br /><br />Very good"
positive,19/6/21,"compared to other egg proteins I have recently used, this one is very sweet.  It is sweetened with splenda, so still very low in actual sugar/carbs.  I prefer to use an unsweetened version and put fruit in the blender with it to naturally sweeten it, but my wife likes this one b/c its easy to instantize in milk (we use almond milk) with a spoon.  No blender required."
positive,25/5/21,"I really like this protein drink. I'm pregnant and trying to increase protein in my diet without adding a whole lot of extra calories or fat. This is the perfect solution. I usually mix it with a combination of 1/2 plain almond milk and half water. I also usually add a little more liquid than it says in the directions, otherwise I find it too sweet. The nice thing is that it is sweetened with stevia instead of a calorie-filled sugar of some sort. I prefer egg protein to other proteins because soy is often GMO and not recommended in high doses in pregnancy (or for anyone actually), and whey protein is a dairy product, which I generally don't tolerate well. Egg protein is perfect for my needs."
positive,7/9/21,"I like this product, and i agree with any post, who says it mixes well, i bought a sample case just to test the waters, and i dont feel bloated or anything after i drink it, i think i feel my body is responding to it very well, i am going to finish up the muscle milk protein because i bought it and i pay over 30 for it, lol, but when i finish up the other proteins i purchase, i am going to stick with egg white protein, since i dont like eating them, everyone taste buds is different, some may like it, some may dont, then depending on your body chemistry some responds well to egg whites, some dont, but as for me personally i like it so far, might try out the strawberry passion protein, but the vanilla kind taste very good, i would suggest this protein should be used for edurance athletes, or people who are into calistenics such as push ups and pull ups,"
positive,3/8/21,"I bought these for my husband because he occassionally likes a cup of coffee at home and it is a hassle to drag out the coffee maker and grinder when he only wants one cup and it's not everyday.  It also comes in handy when guests come over, because we don't tend to keep coffee in the house.<br /><br />Each serving comes in a little pouch that you can easily slip into your pocket, briefcase or travel bag.  The flavor was rich and at around $1.00 a cup, much cheaper than going to Starbucks or anywhere else and grabbing a cup on the way to work.<br /><br />It dissolves completely leaving no grit or residue.  He first tried it in a 12 ounce mug and found it to be a little strong, but was perfect in his 20 ounce travel mug.<br /><br />[...]"
positive,5/9/21,"This is a great stand-in when you can't make it out to Starbucks.  Love having an instant version at home.  Love, love, love it."
positive,25/5/21,Bought a case to see what it was about.  I am a night owl which effects my day-to-day performance and father-related tasks.  After a can I do feel mellow and finding myself going to bed much earlier.
positive,7/9/21,"I love the fact that this is multi-grain baby food.... but like people food, good for you things NEVER taste great... so mix it with bananas or some other fruit. Yes, the texture is a bit difficult to swallow for little ones, hence why you want to thin it out. I read the other reviews and can't believe they never thought to mix this food with something else."
positive,11/9/21,"We love this vegetable pouch for our 18 month old, and more importantly she likes it too. I like that it has sort of a dry texture compared to basic blended vegetables. I stir a touch of milk into it each time and it makes it really creamy. She always finishes it, and its one of our favorites."
positive,13/7/21,I ordered these as a gift in June. They tasted great! They did not arrive in picture perfect condition due to the heat but I was contacted by the company to see what they could do for me.  The strength of a company is not found in things that go correctly but rather in the things that go wrong and what they do about them.  I would recommend them highly

positive,22/6/21,"We usually have fresh lemon grass tea at our local Zen center. It is extremely easy to make, put a few blades of lemon grass in a pot to steep and you will get a fantastic tasting tea.<br /><br />This tea is here is a fine replacement for when you cannot get fresh lemon grass. Lemon grass has many health benefits. It is said to detoxify the liver and can lower uric acid levels, this is important if you have gout.<br /><br />Because you get such a large quantity here on Amazon it should last you quite a while. Caffeine free and light it makes a very refreshing afternoon tea.<br /><br />Give it a try!<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review."
positive,28/7/21,"Tazo Sweet Cinnamon Spice Tea is a very tasteful tea with no unpleasant after taste. I am not sure what a person can say about tea, but this flavor is one of the best I have ever had. It makes great hot tea or iced tea. It's pleasant flavor is a treat all by itself and is excellent without any sweetener.<br /><br />Some teas leave a bitter or strange after taste but this tea does not. Every cup is very special. Even if you leave the tea bag in your cup for a long time, it never gets bitter. Wonderful product!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1588O"">Tazo Sweet Cinnamon Spice Herbal Infusion Tea, Caffeine Free, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>"
positive,13/10/21,"Not bad.  This tea does not taste like an oolong tea.  I'm sure if they say it's oolong, then it probably is an oolong, but it really tastes more like a green tea.  It's also very mildly flavored.  I find it benefits from a longer brew time than recommended.  There's certainly no bitterness upon over brewing this tea as there would be with a black tea, and the slight floral flavor and fragrance seems to be enhanced rather than harmed by this.  The flower bloom is durable: I put an unfinished pot in the refrigerator overnight to try it as iced tea, and the flower survived perfectly well without disintegrating.  If anything, the tea benefited from the additional overnight brew.  Served cold, the flavor comes out even more if you're partial to iced tea.<br /><br />The flower arrangement upon brewing is pretty--nowhere near as pretty or as perfect as the pictures that Numi shows on their website, and it's as likely to bloom lopsided as it is to flower right side up.  Some of them even bloom upside down.  Don't expect perfection and you'll be pleased with it."
positive,19/2/21,"Can't find this or anything like it in our stores anymore.  Good to know I can get it on here."
positive,14/12/20,"Excellent choice for a high fiber cracker.  These taste great and like other Back to Nature items, don't have all the undesirable ingredients you'd like to avoid if necessary. Whole wheat, safflower oil, salt and Vitamin E -- perfect."
positive,14/12/20,"My family loves the taste of these.  They're a bit high in sodium for my liking and for the price, I wish they were organic.  I have purchased the Heart to Heart brand, but they taste much staler and have a strange aftertaste compared to these crackers.  Too bad, because Heart to Heart has half the sodium."
positive,19/2/21,"Very closely resembles a Triscuit cracker...except there is no soy!  (And a bit lighter.)<br /><br />You will not be disappointed with the taste and texture, it is a quality cracker.<br /><br />Enjoy."
negative,10/1/21,"This is a good decaf coffee, but I've never before had a k cup dump the contents into my cup. It's extremely irritating to deal with grounds in the cup and machine when deliberately choosing a system that avoids the mess."
negative,26/3/21,"I'm not a gourmet coffee critic, but this stuff is disappointing.  Based upon previous good reviews, I suspect that the coffee in the K-cups I received is not the same -- they may have changed the manufacturing.  The Wolfgang Puck Decaf I received is lifeless, watery, and tasteless.  There's no aroma when it's brewing in the Keurig.  Never again."
negative,24/3/21,"I tried this product solely for the fact it has Wolfgang's name on it.  I should have stuck with Timothy's brand.  This was way too strong to be labeled a breakfast coffee, more like a dinner coffee.  I will not be buying this again, also way too expensive compared to the others."
positive,24/2/21,"I really enjoy Wolfgang Puck's K-Cups, so far all the ones I've tried haven't left my stomach churning..and,<br /><br />this was my first time trying out the Sorrento Fair Trade Roast and purchased it on a Warehouse Amazon price deal.  I am really happy with my purchase.  The taste of the Sorrento is what I would expect of a Medium Roast = A good, smooth blend.  No bitter, acidic after taste, and leaves you wanting for more after that first cup!  (At least, it left me)! :p  It's doesn't leave you with the ""shhhakes"" either, it has that right ""balance"" you need with your daily cup of coffee.<br /><br />Yes, I will be getting another 24-Count of this when I am finished with this pack!<br /><br />5-Stars!"
positive,19/2/21,My second purchase of this  cofee & like the first cup it has been wonderful to wake up to.  Not too bold or brash but a good drink to start the day with
positive,14/12/20,"This is a favorite in the office and in my house. We burn through this coffee. I've tried a few of the other Wolfgang coffees and this one is by far the best. I've seen better prices for this at a lot of other places. This is an excellent coffee to start your day with."
positive,19/10/21,I bought a small 3 pack of this locally and liked it so much I bought the 48 pack.  Great deal on Amazon.
positive,18/5/21,"I personally don't like strong coffee.  If you like weaker coffee, then this blend is a great choice for you.  Other reviews on here say that its too weak, which is probably true if your used to something strong.<br /><br />I also use flavored creamer to further enhance the taste. For the price, it can't hurt to give it a try."
positive,19/2/21,"I love Sumatra coffee and was excited to receive these K-Cups however was disappointed when I opened my Amazon box and found that the plastic wrap holding the two boxes of K-Cups was full of grinds meaning that there was a possible blowout of a cup... after carefully unwrapping the boxes and attempting to get as little coffee grinds everywhere as possible I opened the first box and all cups were fine, however the second box every kcup was covered in fine grinds and I had to clean each one and found that 3 of the cups were defective due to the top being stamped on at an angle and the grinds had spilled everywhere. I now see other reviews stating they had defective cups as well. However the taste of the coffee is good."
positive,14/12/20,This is one of the best coffees I have ever had for my Keurig.  It is a nice smooth coffee.  And the price is the best price I could find.  I will be buying more.
positive,1/6/21,"Very delicious coffee, thankfully Amazon sells this flavor now.  I have been waiting for it since I tasted this last year.  I like the fact that you sell it in a 2 Pack rather than a single."
positive,1/4/21,This k-cup actually smelled up the office. And it tastes as good as it smells. I found it to be very flavorful.
positive,15/4/21,"Sometimes we have a problem ordering the k-cups because they are way too strong for us--even if you order medium blend.  This coffee was great--just right!  It was a smooth blend, and was perfect for a morning cup of coffee--or anytime!  Would definitely order again!"
positive,19/5/21,"I have tried about 25 different K-Cup flavors, and this is my favorite.  It has a wonderful aroma, and just the right amount of Hazelnut.  Use the subscribe option, and this is a deal that can't be beat."
negative,19/2/21,"I thought it had a bitter orange flavor, however my husband and friend liked it."
positive,14/12/20,"Tried this for the first time this week and it is now my favorite coffee --with a hint of flavor (coconut). Full bodied, and no after taste, Jamaica Me Crazy is just what I love for an afternoon pick-me up, or to wake up and have an immediate smile on my face. Seriously -- It's Awesome! Highly Recommended."
negative,28/7/21,"I thought this coffee was really horrible. Had one cup and will throw the rest away because it can't be returned."
positive,29/6/21,"This k-cup is one of my favorites along with Coffee People's Jet Fuel and Black Tiger.  If you like a strong, rich coffee, this will fit the bill."
positive,15/10/21,"Even with the chocolate chunks, these bars taste far less sweeter than most granola bars out there and I really appreciated that.<br /><br />They have 110 calories each and 8 grams sugar which is less than Kudos Chocolate Chip (120 cal, 12 sugar) or a Cascadian Farms Chocolate Chip granola bar (140 cal, 10 sugar).  When I need a quick snack, I can eat one with a glass of sparkling water and I feel full until the next meal.  If I need a quick meal I eat one of these with two string cheeses, a large apple and water -- I can make it until dinner.<br /><br />I would recommend these to anyone looking for a tasty and quick snack."
positive,20/7/21,"I am doing the ""subscribe and save"" thing with these crackers. I thought that it would take a while to get through the six boxes, but boy was I wrong. Already we're halfway through the boxes. Time to order more!"
positive,12/10/21,"The crackers are very tasty and we just tried them out with a little salsa on top for a healthy low cal snack and my wife and I absolutely love'em. We will definitely get more once we run out!"
positive,19/2/21,"I would recommend this tea, it has a fresh taste with an amazing acai grape flavor that I have not had before.  It also gave me energy which I can always use!"
positive,14/12/20,This is oil is quite a good value compared to the grocery store prices.  We always keep a can in the refrigerator.
positive,2/7/21,"This is an aromatic and tasty oil, great on salads or for scrambled eggs.<br />I'm sure I'll find more uses for this as time goes on!  Free shipping<br />makes it a great deal.  My only nit pick is the lid.  Two of the three<br />bottles in the shipment had very tight lids that were difficult to open."
positive,11/3/21,"I received a jar of this Instant Espresso as a gift from my mother-in-law.  I was quite ""insulted"" at first, as I've never used instant coffee of any kind and couldn't figure out why she gave it to me! Then this past weekend, I was out of coffee beans & this was all I had (must have coffee in morning).  So I made it, & WOW, it was awesome!! In fact, I'm drinking a mug of it right now as I right this review! I LOVE IT!!  However, I make it in more of a latte fashion.  I've also added hot chocolate to it for a mocha latte.  I'll definitely be looking for it at my neighborhood stores, and if I can't find it, I'll be getting it here on Amazon. Definitely a great buy!!"
positive,10/4/21,I know nothing about this CO2 method of decaffeinating but thought I would give this a try. I usually buy the Swiss water processed. This had a wonderful chocolatey taste. It also claimed to be 99.9% caffein free. Hopefully this is all true because it really is the best I have tried of decaf.
positive,22/7/19,"When I read the reviews, I noticed someone mentioned the box was light.  It is, but it holds a lot - these pork rinds are compact; they expand when cooked, so there's a lot more in the box than it looks like.<br /><br />As snacks go, these are high in protein and low in carbohydrate.<br /><br />I think this is a really good value, and these are very flavorful - I especially enjoy them with bean dip.<br /><br />The only thing that I'd change is, I'd like a lightly salted version; I don't always want that much salt."
positive,2/2/20,"Tasty, spicy, and good. Became quite the conversation piece at work. No one have ever  heard of microwave pork rinds before. They tasted them and love them. Only draw back depending on type of microwave as to how they will cook."
positive,2/2/20,"Really easy to prepare and very yummy. With my microwave I put them in for 1:40 and they turn out perfect. Warm, crunchy and tasty. And without the carbs, they don't impact your blood sugar which is a real boon for us diabetics."
negative,31/8/19,"But the taste got sickening quite fast. It also makes a really weird stench/smell when you are microwaving it. Sometimes it would hurt my tongue when I am eating it. All in all, I threw the rest of them away after my 3rd bag. It might just be me but I can't say I would let the guests of my home try these so I can't recommend them here to anyone."
positive,22/7/19,"I have not had pork rinds in more than 20 years and thought that this would be fun to try but I didn'nt have high expectations. Microwave popcorn is pervasive and a proven success. However, I had never heard of microwave pork rinds and it was hard to imagine that it could really work as well as popcorn.  Well it does.  I don't have much with which to compare the taste (20+ years ago), however, the texture and crispiness is just as I remembered. I like spicy snacks and as another reviewer noted, these are not especially spicy but I used a few shakes of cayenne pepper and that did the job.<br /><br />It is very important to shake the bag in order to evenly distrbute the rinds throughout the bag before putting it into the microwave.  I have also found that 2 mins 30 seconds is the best time in my microwave oven to pop all of the bacon rinds.<br /><br />I have eaten 9 bags of the pork rinds and I love them.  They are light and crunchy and it is my experience that they pop better than popcorn.  And each bag is only 1 carb."
positive,12/1/20,I bought these years ago at Walmart<br />and then they stopped carrying them.  I was searching the internet and found them at Amazon.  We ordered a box of each.  I like the spicy and my husband likes the orginal.  A learning process will be a sure thing until you figure out how many minutes for your microwave.  They are great and we love them.
positive,19/2/20,"I saw this product demonstrated on The Food Channel and knew I had to order it as I LOVE pork rinds but the bagged ones are usually old and sort of stale or processed tasting.  Follow CAREFULLY the directions with these for a spicy, fresh and tasty snack every time. YUM!!"
positive,27/11/19,"Wow! These are great! I had them for the Super Bowl Party and everyone just went nuts over this product. Great taste and just the right snacking size. One word of caution, FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! Even though every bag I cooked was absolutely perfect, it was evident if you get distracted, they will burn real quick. Remember, this product IS NOT POPCORN. So there is no sound to help let you know its done. Again, FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! They are fabulous!"
positive,12/12/19,"These microwave pork rinds are quite tasty for them to be cooked in the microwave!  My husband and I love the hot & spicy flavor better than the plain because it has more flavor.  The only drawback I see to these is that if you have an older microwave or one that is not as powerful (at least 1100 watts), the pork rinds do not cook as well."
positive,26/9/20,"These pork skins have a great taste. Very fresh ""homemade"" taste. The cooking procedure can be a bit tricky though. I have a 1000w microwave with a turn table and did not get the same results with each bag. The first bag I tried with 1 minute, and additional 15 second intervls, stopping at 1min, 15 seconds. Several skins had not yet cooked. So I rolled the end of the bag back up and gave it 15 more seconds. Still some did not fully ""explode"" or ""bloom"".  The second bag I started with 1 minute, 30 seconds. Slightly better results, but again I needed to re-roll the end of the bag and give it another 15-30 seconds, still using the 15 second intervals for best results.  The third bag I started with 2 minutes (which is also the amount of time that is used on my popcorn setting) and the results were not as good. Too many had over-cooked and were too hard to eat.<br />My suggestion would be to stick with the 1 minute with 15 second intervals, listening closely to the sound. (They emit a slight hissing sound when they expand).  As soon as the bag has fully opened and the hissing sound subsides, it's a good sign you have reached the optimal result.  This item is a little more work than just picking up a bag of ready to eat at the store, but the improved flavor is worth it. To me anyway.  The jury is still out on whether the ""healthy"" claim can hold water.  I will continue to use restraint and only endulge with this treat on occassion.  Good Eats!"
positive,22/7/19,"We originally found these at Wally World.  When we could no longer get there, I hit the internet.  Both are quite good . . . we prefer the spicy."
negative,2/2/20,"I normally rate whatever items I buy but rarely offer words of advice. Well, these things changed my mind. I love pork rinds. Usually I buy a tub of them from Sam's, but since I'm the only one in the house who eats them, they go stale long before I can make a dent in them. So I saw these, and the positive reviews, and thought, ""Hey, that's the perfect solution!"". It's a perfect solution all right...a perfect solution to get me to stop eating pork rinds.<br /><br />I made the first bag, as per the directions. I had no problem with them crisping at all. They were perfect in that regard, nice and crunchy. But the taste is awful! I thought, perhaps, it was a bad bag. Nope. The second batch tasted just as terrible. I have no idea what they use to flavor them, but it tastes like a strange mixture of salt and soap. There's enough salt in them to kill a horse, which in and of itself wouldn't be so bad (I actually like salty things) but when combined with whatever garbage they dug out of their backed up shower and called seasoning, it left me hunting for listerine - or gasoline, whatever I could get my hands on - to get the taste out of my mouth. I'm still shuddering from it. If you like the taste of feet, go for it. If not, I'd suggest heading to Sam's to buy the wonderful tasting pork rinds we all know and love."
negative,23/5/20,"So I made one bag of these pork rinds & it came out good! I decided to try another & the taste was unbelievable - it had an ammoniated taste & smell to it! I thought that maybe it was a bad bag. I stayed away for a few weeks & decided to give them another try. BAD IDEA! They tasted like ammonia again! This wasn't caused by incorrect cooking time because they all came out looking puffy, and crispy. I ended up throwing the box out."
negative,22/11/20,"I got these for my dad from his wish list.  He thought they would be spicy and flavorful but they just tasted like cumin and had a funky smell.  The box came with 18 individual bags but after you open one bag, it's impossible to even want to put yourself through that again.  They are nasty!!!  Avoid them at all cost!!  Yuck!!"
positive,30/3/20,"A delicious product, can't seem to find it in the stores these days. I recommend to try if you like pork rinds.<br />Quick Delivery and great to have for guests."
positive,8/7/20,IF YOUR A PORK RIND LOVER THIS IS AN AWESOME PRODUCT FOR THOSE WONDERFUL TASTE BUDS. THEY MELT IN YOUR MOUTH BEFORE THEY GO DOWN. MMM MMM GOOD.
positive,4/1/20,"It cooks in microwave so fast, and it's really good right after you cook, but unfortunately it has MSG in it. Nonetheless, the fat and sodium content on this is not too bad when compared to regular pork rinds. I uploaded a photo of the nutrition facts so you can see the ingredients too."
positive,30/1/21,"If you enjoy pork rinds like I do, you can't miss this product.  A minute and a half in the microwave, and you've got warm, crunchy deliciousness.  There's just the right amount of spice, too.  This is a great product."
positive,2/11/20,"I found microwave pork rinds quite by accident. But ever since, they are something I have wanted. Now I found them on Amazon, and I couldn't be happier.<br /> It's a quick, easily prepared snack, and as other reviewers have pointed out, not bad for your diet.<br /> Once they come put of the microwave, open the bag, pour them out, and marvel as you hear them still popping and crackling in the bowl. I may never go back to bagged pork rinds ever again"
negative,17/10/20,"For a microwavable chili, this stuff, and the firehouse variant, do taste good. However, I never get to eat the full container because it tends to explode in the microwave. I've followed the directions exactly on the label, as well as tried some tweaking, and nothing so far has prevented it from exploding.<br /><br />The problem is the plastic lid that is to be left on. It is left on because it is vented but covers the chili to keep it from splattering. Irony is there is not enough venting, the chili plugs the holes, and as it boils and water vapor expands, it basically becomes a messy bomb in your microwave.<br /><br />I wish I could say it was user error and that there is a way to enjoy this without the mess. So far the firehouse variant hasn't exploded on me, but it also has less meat and beans to it. Since the firehouse variant is not really all that spicy, I may just stick with that until Campbells can make this not a bomb."
positive,22/7/19,"5 stars on taste. Beef tastes like it was grilled before it was added to the chili. The only thing that concerns me is the 11 grams of sugar. That can't be good for you."
positive,2/2/20,"This Chile was surprising good and not overly salty or processed tasting.  Actually a good, light and tasty lunch!"
positive,4/10/20,"The Amita Peach Nectar is a very tasty natural fruit drink that is loaded with sugar. So, if you are looking for an alternative to orange juice and can tolerate the calories, you might want to give this drink a try. Also, it makes a nice ingredient in mixed alcoholic beverages such as peach bellinis."
positive,1/4/20,"Tastes great, and it's a quality product at a price a few dollars cheaper than the alternatives, even at our local supermarkets.  It's tough to find Grade A medium amber syrup in pints.  I'll probably just keep ordering these a few times a year."
positive,8/5/20,This is one of the few teas that I will always have on hand.  It is a wonderful blend of beneficial herbs that has a great taste.  I drink it almost every day.
positive,18/6/20,"I saw this tea from my friend's room and asked for a couple. She has the Super Slimming tea and the Detox tea. I usually combine the two. It made me go to the bathroom more frequently than usual, but I feel much relieved like more refreshed. My pimples went away and my back acne is non-existent. The store in my area stopped selling this kind of brand, sucks! I have to purchased it on-line now."
positive,20/8/20,These are my favorites and I have reordered more than once.  Perfect for desert without all the calories and is soooo good.  Cant find these locally so go to Amazon for my candy fix.
positive,1/6/21,"Nature's Path makes some excellent cereals, and this is definitely one of them. I really enjoy it because it has great flavor, a good crunch, and is a very healthy food. In fact, this is my favorite cereal-- hands down.  I totally recommend buying the pack of 6-- a penny saved is a penny earned. Besides, it's not like the cereal is going to go bad; it'll keep for months until you break the seal."
positive,4/7/21,"I recieved the delivery quicker than I thought I would. I was concerned with how the food item would be packaged. The Gyro slices were still frozen when I recieved them. The gyro slices were delicious, they taste better than most of the restaurants I frequent."
positive,5/2/20,"Excellent Product!  Great taste!  Perfect portion!<br /><br />Only 100 calories in a bag.  I microwave it for 1:30 and it comes out perfect each time.<br /><br />Fills a medium tupperware bowl.<br /><br />And it was an very good value!  Only $8.98 for 3 boxes, shipped! ONLY 30 cents for each bag!"
positive,22/7/19,"I was placed on a severly restricted sodium diet three years ago, and one day at my local market happened upon this product.  It was like I finally had stepped back into the world of taste. If you have ever read nutrition labels on soups you know a sodium restricted diet does not allow for the vast majority of them.  So now I can have a healthy organic warm bowl of comforting soup whenever I like and if I purchase it through amazon by the case, shipping is free making it a lot less expensive then my local market.  Give it a try!"
positive,2/2/20,"I'm on a low sodium diet and this still has plenty of taste without salt"
positive,22/11/20,"Since I have to watch my sodium I have looked for a very low sodium soup for quite awhile.  Campbell's made one but no longer does.  If you had tried theirs this one is far tastier and better."
positive,1/3/20,"This was a great sampler of green coffee to roast.  I haven't tried them all yet, but I liked the variety of regions and it really was a great product for a great price!"
positive,23/11/20,Taken is taken but after you have a lot of different kinds you tend to establish a taste favorite. Basically if the price is good go for it.
positive,5/4/21,"This grain is an excellent substitute for rice.  it only takes two cans of chicken broth to one package of Quinoa to make a lot of very tasty and filling finished product which can be used with gravy, sauce, mixed vegetables or anything you like."
positive,27/4/20,"Ok Folks - listen up. For special occasions, we'll spend the big bucks and get a rack of lamb.  You're lucky today if you can even find it in the stores - it's so expensive - often at $20-40 per pound.  So, the very last thing you want to do, after spending all that money, is ruin it with the wrong flavoring. Colorado Spices, New Zealand Lamb Rub has the right blend of herbs that goes well on just about any meat.  We just used it on some fresh bluefin and yellowfin tuna and it was FANTASTIC. My 88 year old Mother, who cooks every day and is not a huge spice fan (she's used to plain, New England cooking) loves and uses the rub on chicken, lamb, and fish.  She's having me order another case and loves the individual packets - as the rub does not lose its taste or flavor and stays fresh.  This is a great product!"
positive,8/3/21,"I have never had any hot chocolate that tastes better than this. Not homemade, not from starbucks, not from Swissmiss... This is hands down the best I've ever had. I go through so much of this stuff because whenever friends come over, they go straight for it.<br /><br />But what happened to the price? Most k-cups run from about $0.45 - $0.65 but Amazon has these things going for $0.92. Even Bed Bath & Beyond has them cheaper than that. Bring the price back down to something reasonable and your 5-star review will return."
positive,30/1/20,"This is a fantastic soy based product that's not too sweet, is very smoothe, and wonderfully chocolaty.<br />i highly recommend this."
positive,22/7/19,"My 12 year old loves to make a cup of this before school every morning. The cocoa tastes wonderful and brews up nice. We add a splash of milk to cool it off and it's so good. I don't taste anything artificial, in fact the quality is great. We will bring this camping for the younger kids. With the powders we always had clumps, this brews a great cup every time and tastes like the expensive coffee shop stuff!"
positive,2/2/20,"The local auto shop offers this free to it customers. I've tried it twice and liked it both times. Perhaps, if I had to pay for it, I might not love the price, but I would still enjoy the flavor."
positive,2/9/20,"Our beloved Bengal kitty, Isabel, is 13 years old and suffering from kidney stones, which are inoperable in felines. For years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health declined. Our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she'd eat: ""She might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years.""<br /><br />So, we offered her one soft food after another. She turned up her nose at the expensive, vet-sold brands and repeatedly rejected one national brand and flavor after another. Finally, to her gustatory delight (and our great relief), she made her choice: this particular Wiskas version is the ONLY kind she'll eat day in and day out. It MUST be Whiskas with the turkey AND GIBLETS in GRAVY. The gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she can't resist.<br /><br />We surmise that, like humans, our pets have food preferences linked to palate-pleasing aroma and taste. This Whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our Izzy. No, it's not the best choice for managing kidney stones, but she's got to eat. (So you won't worry that we're ignoring her renal problems, she's on daily medication and is doing quite well.)<br /><br />It's not an inexpensive cat food, but its packaging is very convenient and space-saving. The Amazon auto-ship program is a life saver. The cartons always arrive on time, and the per-package bulk rate is lower than the price of small quanities. Also, our local Target was the only place we could find this exact variety, and now the store no longer carries it. (Remember, our cat demands GIBLETS and GRAVY and accepts no substitutes).<br /><br />Give autoship a try. The price is better, and you can easily adjust the quantity and frequency of shipment or cancel altogether."
positive,26/1/21,"Great cheese. Wonderful flavor. Made my spaghetti & meatballs better than it's ever been & made the lasagna even better. Fast delivery."
positive,9/1/21,I recommend using half water and half skim milk. I usually mix 5 oz water with 5 oz skim milk and heat in the micro for two minutes.  Add the packet and sugar or sweetener.  Great for a quick cup of coffee without the hassle of cleaning the machine.
positive,30/7/21,"This Honey Granules is tasty and a welcome alternative to Cane Sugar. I use it in my morning oats (steel cut oats), Bird's custard and Tea. One or two teaspoonfuls go a long way. It is better stored in the refrigerator. Consider it in place of over-processed store bought cane sugar."
positive,30/10/20,"I am a peanut butter fanatic, and I get excited every time Amazon offers a bulk-order of peanut butter at a low price.  I use peanut butter as a mid-day energy boosting snack -- straight off the spoon and without any other food to supplement it.  It's just THAT good to me.<br /><br />I was more than happy with Skippy Reduced Fat Creamy.  I like the smooth texture it has, and it has a great mouth-feel that isn't the thick ""stick to the roof of my mouth"" kind that requires a glass of milk to be able to eat.  I don't feel that Skippy reduced the flavor from its original peanut butter along with the fat to make this product -- it tastes delicious and satisfying.<br /><br />If you're a peanut butter lover like me, please look out for the fantastic prices Amazon has on Skippy Reduced Fat Creamy -- you won't regret buying it, and the reduced fat intake is a bonus!"
positive,3/8/20,This is the first Redued-Fat Peanut Butter that I have thought was a good peanut butter.  I will buy it again when this is gone.
positive,29/1/21,This PB tastes good and is goood for you! It makes good sandwiches. I only wish it were in stock more often!
positive,24/10/21,"Hemp foods are great, the slightly nutty taste is always something I enjoy. I almost rated this item four stars because it doesn't have a strong hemp seed taste - but after some thought it is probably best that way.<br /><br />I add a bit of brown sugar and one packet will fill me up (not true with most other oatmeals)."
positive,24/10/21,Great taste.  Almonds are high in overall fat but low in saturated fats that most contribute to weight gain.  Buy a case; they stay pretty fresh when sealed for 6 months
negative,16/10/21,"There are several types of teas in the world indian ceylon scented teas like jasmine, there's oolong, black green, but one thing binds all these teas together, they taste like tea.<br /><br />This substance has no flavor only an astringent quality.  It is not drinkable plain.  Which I suppose is why people require all sorts of recipes adding sugar, or spices, anything to give this tea some flavor and take away the horrid bitterness.<br /><br />I think it's even worse than the bagged lipton tea if that is possible.  In the bagged tea, they don't put dust in the teabags because it would fall right out of the bag, but since this is loose tea, lipton saw fit to add dust, twigs, anything but the actual leaves.<br /><br />What should you drink?  Anything you like.  I suggest browsing this site called the English Tea Store (no affiliation) just to get an idea about what types of teas it is possible to purchase.<br /><br />I astounds me that anyone could drink this substance and call it ""tea"".  It is not tea, it is particles of bitterness, dust, pieces of twigs, black and tasteless leavings of what used to be a tea plant.<br /><br />What the hell is wrong with you people, to drink this stuff.  By the way I have nothing against some lipton tea, but when you drink this stuff you need to add lemon, sugar, or cream, something because it is awful stuff trying to drink it on its own.<br /><br />If you have to buy tea at a supermarket, try the twinings darjeeling that's a decent blend you can drink."
positive,24/10/21,If you like a strong but smooth flavorful coffee this is it. I have tried others and just keep coming back to this one. My second joice would be the Starbucks Italian blend.
positive,25/9/21,"I am on a gluten free diet and find most gluten free snack high in calories and fat.  These cookies are awesome. The serving size is 4 cookies, calorie count per serving is between 100 and 120 and fat is between 1 and 2. Great flavor and crunch and almost healthy."
positive,19/10/21,"What's not to like?  Delicious smokehouse almonds in the perfect size package.  I keep them in my locker at the gym for a post workout snack.  They are very smokey-don't leave an open package in your car, like I did...It made my car smell like cigarettes.  However, this is unlikely to happen as it is hard to only eat part of the package as they are so good."
negative,20/10/21,"These were fair.  I don't feel they are AA quality.  Would not repurchase."
positive,19/10/21,"Very beautiful and added a wonderful appearance to some of our Christmas Cookies.  Tasted good as well, with no bitter or chemical flavor.  A good alternative to all the frosting that is popular these days on cookies."
positive,15/6/21,"I switched my cat to Halo's Salmon indoor formula and have noticed a marked difference in her coat and reduced smell from the litter box.<br /><br />Cats are snobs when it comes to food.  Switching them to a new food takes at least a week, more if you have a picky eater like me.  Start small and work more in each day. If you moved from a diet of Raman Noodles to a high protein, high fiber diet instantly you wouldn't want to eat it either.  :)  You get what you pay for when you buy food for yourself or your pet."
negative,4/8/21,"First of all, the tea is gross. It tastes nothing like bubble milk tea. secondly, the seller must know this product is less than expected because they sell it in incriments of two (2.2lb) bags. NOW IM STUCK WITH TWO BAGS (4.4LBS) of this junk. I want my 30 bucks back."
positive,4/8/21,"As other's have mentioned, this is available in other stores for much cheaper so I recommend to shop around before buying on Amazon.<br /><br />When it comes to the actual product, I highly recommend buying this if you own a Keurig. You are able to discretly hide so many of the Keurig cups. The carousel is a neat product but when you don't have counter space, it just doesn't work.<br /><br />This unit is pretty great quality but I do find that it is tough to slide sometimes. The material that they use on the top of the tray makes sure that your Keurig doesn't move at all.<br /><br />Highly recommend that you pick one up whether it be from BBB or Amazon!"
positive,18/7/21,I eat these cookies frequently using the subscribe method.  The nutrition provided is high quality.<br />I recommend all the Erin cookies for a snack or meal.
positive,18/10/21,"I am surprised by how good this breakfast cookie's flavor is; it has depth of spices and textures and is truly delicious.<br /><br />300 calories seemed a bit high, but I ate one with a large glass of water and it has been 4 hours and my tummy is not growling yet, I even worked out too.<br /><br />I love that it doesn't have any freaky ingredients and it was very soft and moist.  I gave a little pinch of it to my toddler daughter and she enjoyed it too.  I prefer to have actual oatmeal in the morning with fruit and yogurt, but these breakfast cookies are great if the morning goes sideways and I don't have time or opportunity to fix something.<br /><br />The problem I found with other protein bars and such is that in about 2 hours I was feeling peckish and looking for snacks until lunch.  I did not have that problem with this breakfast cookie,  it may have more calories than I thought I wanted to ""spend,"" but it is very worth it since it keeps me out of the kitchen until lunchtime.<br /><br />Another nice thing: there are not any chips or icing on this cookie to melt in the mid-day heat, so you can keep one of these in the purse or diaper bag without creating a big mess for yourself later ;)<br /><br />I keep them in the freezer for freshness, they are really moist and chewy once you let them thaw or microwave.  I put one on a saucer and nuke for 20-30 seconds from frozen solid, it turns out like its warm from the oven.  I do not recommend keeping them in the fridge, baked goods and bread will get dried out if kept there.<br /><br />UPDATE:I have lost 35 pounds in the last year with very minimal changes and these cookies have helped me go from not eating breakfast and snacking all morning, to eating breakfast no matter how busy and not needing to snack or eat until lunchtime. They are very filling and are perfect for when you don't have time to make anything."
positive,15/6/21,"So far have tried two flavors, this and oat & raisins and prefer the other better. This flavor tastes a little bland compared to the other for some reason even though it has more ingredients. But it's not inedible or anything, just a little bland.<br /><br />As for whether it helps you feel full.... I'd say it doesn't for me cause it's just a 3oz size afterall and I'm used to eating a lot more. But I always skip breakfast so eating this is better than nothing considering studies show breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Eating breakfast also helps you lose weight and raise metabolism.<br /><br />I'd give the taste 3 stars but bought it for amazing $2 (17 cents each cookie) so price gets 5 stars which avg out to 4 stars."
positive,4/8/21,"I first purchased Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookie in the Caramel Apple flavor. While it was tasty and very fulfilling, I wasn't forsure if I was in love with them (and really, why waste your time eating something you don't love?) So, based on customer reviews I then tried the Morning Glory Breakfast cookie.. I loved the bits of nut and I have to say  it is tasty and fulfilling! It is my 2nd favorite cookie and I easily give them a 5 star rating!<br /><br />I again began browsing the cookie flavors and spent time reading customer reviews and decided to try the Peanut Butter Chocolate Chunk and all I can say is third times the charm. These breakfast cookies are knock your socks off delicious ! I plan on stocking up so that I don't have to order over the hot summer months (as I have read on some of the cookie reviews that because these cookies are so fresh and have no preservatives to prevent spoilage that they are prone to mold if left out to long), so I figure, why take the chance? I'm just going to make several purchases before summer gets here!!!<br /><br />I totally recommend these breakfast cookies! My only wish is that they came in a variety box so one isn't forced to purchase a whole pack to sample one flavor. Yes, they are a little high calorie, so you might not want to use them as a snack, but for a meal replacement they are fantastic ! I love the natural ingredients and I know these cookies are fresh (makes you wonder how ""fresh"" those meal replacement bars are that sit on the store shelf for months?)"
positive,8/6/21,These cookies are tasty but just a little too gooey and the calorie count is 300 for one cookie--this is a bit high!
positive,15/6/21,"This has recently become my staple breakfast cereal. After trying many high on taste low on nutrition cereals, I decided to find one that fits my needs. I am a regular at the gym so I have to watch what I eat. This one is not only high in protein and fiber, but also tastes much better that the other similar cereals with high fiber.<br />It can easily become addictive as it has the right balance between taste and nutrition.<br />The price is affordable too and the product can be easily found in grocery stores."
positive,4/8/21,"Sustainably caught off the California Coast, packaged as disclosed in a previous review. I feel a tad guilty buying 10 at at time at the local co-op but they are simply the best tasting sardines, distinctive and flavorful. You know you are buying premium product compared to the plethora of sardine purveyors out there: Nordic, Portugal, Mediterranean, etc...The cool waters off the California are well known for sardines"
positive,25/9/21,"Just had a can of these and wanted to confirm the great quality of this product. Excellent taste and three big sardines barely fitting into the can. I'll get more ..."
positive,19/10/21,"I love this coffee!  It has very good flavor for decaf.  I have been looking for a good decaf coffee because i've been trying to give up caffeine - and this is the best one I have found so far."
positive,4/9/21,"I looked a long time for dark roast decaf that tasted like this one does.The package doesn't say where it is grown, but it tastes like Columbian beans to me. I hope Amazon keeps handling it. GREAT COFFEE, Gerald"
positive,31/8/21,Great product our dog is loving a tasting treat that is good for her 14 year old bones
negative,9/10/21,"I have tried several different types of sugar-free chocolates and this is one of the worst.  Instead, I recommend the Dove dark chocolate and the Russell Stover coconut."
positive,15/6/21,"I like these. They are not gas-producing and they hold shape OK for canned beans. Flavor is good. Love that they don't have added salt."
positive,4/8/21,"I bought these on super sale because I needed them for a pie crust and they were cheap.  I got the 3-pack and was at first dismayed to find that they were not packed like other graham crackers are usually packed, they were loose in a bag, not stacked in bricks to fill the box  -- this meant there were many less per box than I had anticipated.  But when I tried one I was immediately impressed, they taste fantastic!<br /><br />These taste nothing like the kind of graham crackers we were fed in kindergarden, they have actual flavor and are much more than just an ingredient or child's fare.  What these lack in volume they make up for in quality.<br /><br />I immediately ordered three more 3-packs while they were so cheap, I have a toddler at home and am happy to supply us all with these wonderful graham crackers.  They do not have any scary fillers or ingredients; they are made with butter and not trans fat, and you can snack on nine of them with your coffee for only 130 calories -- not bad!<br /><br />They also make a pie crust that is noticeably better than what I used to make dessert crusts with.<br /><br />I was so impressed at what Stonewall Kitchen could do to a graham cracker that I am going to check out other products they make."
positive,15/6/21,"This tastes great. At first it tastes a bit strange but i enjoyed the slight coffee taste. I mixed the Amazing Green Superfood (the chocolate version) with it which made the Amazing Green taste much better. I need to buy more of this Hemp Shake since i'm out. It really makes the Amazing Green taste much better. I mix it with milk using a little wisk, which works well. I recommend this to anyone trying to be healtheir, boost their immune system, and it is a great snack.  Try both the products together, it's a great combination. I have been using it regularly for a few months now and i have noticed that i have stayed healthy. I even managed to go to disney world during the new year holiday without getting sick! As a teacher getting sick is common for me, but i have noticed that i've been healthier since using these products. Give it a try!"
positive,4/8/21,"I agree with the others that say this is one of the best hemp shakes out there. I started off with the original Nutiva hemp powder and once I finished that I decided to try the chocolate. It is amazing! It is much easier for me to gulp this down in the morning. I mix it up in a Blender Bottle (also sold on Amazon) with a little water and some type of milk. I really like mixing it with vanilla hemp milk or whole grain rice milk but regular milk works fine, too!<br /><br />Nutiva is the LEAST grainy hemp shake I have come across yet. I have tried several kinds and even though I can drink them I much prefer Nutiva over any other."
positive,15/6/21,"Originally tried this because it was on sale, and I figured that even if it was gross I'd only be out a buck. Happily it tastes great, mainly have used it in coffee and tea. Just ordered my second box."
positive,4/8/21,"How nice it is to no longer be deprived of pasta and noodles. If you follow a low carb lifestyle, then House Foods Shirataki (Tofu) Noodles are heaven sent. I've been enjoying this product for well over a year and I'm so very happy to have found it. I heard about it on the Dr. Oz show and ran right out and bought some. I've tried the fettucine and spaghetti noodles also, but the angel hair is the most versatile. People who found them too rubbery probably did not follow the package directions. For best results, they have to be thoroughly rinsed and parboiled for at least three minutes. I am also amazed at how forgiving this product is. Once I got distracted and let the noodles simmer for almost 20 minutes and they STILL turned out fine. Maybe even better! If you want that ramen-like flavor do this: after parboiling and drying, saute them over high heat in a skillet with peanut oil and/or sesame oil, or hot chile oil. Add a few shakes of salt, onion & garlic powder and toss. Then just carry on with your recipe. They're very much like rice noodles so you won't miss a beat with stir-frys and noodle soups. I've also had great success with Italian dishes. I've used them with meatballs or Italian sausage in Marinara sauce. Also, with shrimp & scallops in a cream & wine sauce, just to name a few. Topped with grated, melted cheese, I got ALL of the joy and practically none of the carbs. However, one package really only serves one. This is an excellent, healthy alternative to pasta and noodles that will not wreak havoc upon your glycemic index. Good cooks will have no problem incorporating this into their menu planning."
positive,1/10/21,"I can't recommend this company enough.  I always receive my Pepsie's within two days.  The price is far less than I pay for it here. Plus I get it delivered to my door."
positive,1/7/18,"Great flavors and crunchiness.  Sometimes gluten free food can be bland, but these are really flavorful.  This is also a great buy if you compare only buying one bag of these to the variety that you get."
positive,10/8/18,"This salt is so good, you could almost eat it plain. I am telling you, sprinkling this with your fingers onto salads, chicken, fish, is amazing. Definitely don't waste this by cooking it, where you could use regular salt. This salt needs to be tasted as it really brings out the flavour of food in a really beautiful way. This is meant to be sprinkled on foods after they have cooked -- roasted chicken for example, or on raw vegetables like tomatoes or cucumbers. This is the Foodie's Salt!<br /><br />Now, I have noticed this salt is easier to buy in the regular grocery stores, so if you can, buy it there where it is cheaper to do so."
positive,1/7/18,"I bought these to share with the office and the disappeared almost instantly.  They are very good and contain enough protein to keep people going while suppressing that ""snacky"" feeling.  These are a great snack to carry with you as they are very light (for example, on a flight or road trip).  I highly recommend that you try a few of the other flavors as well.  They have this snack in Chicken, Turkey and Beef in various flavors."
positive,10/8/18,"We have been looking for a cracker for our daughter whom we have just put on the GFCF diet. The Glutino cracker is about as close to a ""normal"" cracker that we have come across. The rest of us who are not on the diet even think these are good. They have a yummy buttery and salty taste to them. We bought them here on amazon.com in a case of 6 boxes for $24. Very reasonable. Highly recommend to anyone on the GFCF diet who misses their crackers. Makes a nice snack to pack in the car for road trips or flights."
positive,13/9/18,"I bought this product for my son who is in grad school. He said Emeril's K-cups were the best tasting ones he has tried so far. I will definitely buy them for him again."
positive,17/7/18,"Tried a new coffee recently and have to say that Emerils Gourmet Coffee was just what I expected, a dark bold flavor that I love."
positive,16/1/19,"I am a coffee fanatic - drink it day and night, no, coffee does not keep me awake.  I am enjoying the flavor of Emerils bold.  When I got my Keurig it came with a sample pak and in it were two samples of Emerils coffee.  I immediately went to Amazon to see if I could order larger amounts than at the Keurig site.  I am so glad I did as, yes, Amazon had larger paks at a very reasonable price.  This will become one of my repeat orders in the future."
positive,16/1/18,"We love this product!  Our baby is 6 months old and we're introducing new foods to her.  So far she has tried the pumpkin, and she can't get enough!!!  She grabs for the spoon!  We love that this product is organic and that use can use breastmilk to mix so your baby gets added nutrients.  It's portable, compact, and you can take it anywhere.  If at a restaurant or away from home, simply warm up your milk and combine.  It's really fantastic!"
positive,16/1/19,"If you used to buy Old El Paso Refried Beans with Sausage and liked that product, which they do not produce anymore, this is the next best thing. I tried these and they are very good, better than any home made stuff I tried to do. I tried special ordering with my local grocery, but they said they could not get the product in and Amazon has a better price than the website for Latin Products. I would definitely recommend this product and will purchase again."
positive,1/8/20,"Pamela's makes some of the best tasting cookies I have ever had. I have never tasted a bad product from this company, all the cookies are great but this one is my favorite of all time. They're moist, chewy and a much healthier choice than most other cookies on the market. So if you are on a diet or not, if you are sensitive to wheat or not, these taste great. I look forward to the day that Pamela's expands their product line!"
positive,1/7/18,"I love pineapple juice and drink it every day. Fresh is the best, but this is surprisingly good. I usually keep some on hand for convenience. It is so much better tasting than the stuff from concentrate. The price on Amazon is kind of high though. I find it's cheaper just to stock up at our local grocer."

positive,15/2/20,Very nice product for those wanting to enjoy the pleasure of lasagna but are on a gluten free diet. Great alternative.
positive,22/4/21,"This is very good maple syrup, but like most pure maple syrup, it is very expensive. My husband and I duped ourselves when purchasing this product. We did the math wrong, and though that we were paying about $25 for a half gallon rather than only 32 oz.  Man was I surprised to see how small the jug was when it came in the mail!"
positive,25/9/20,I really like the Pamelas Products Whenever bars. They have a chocolately coconut taste and not too sweet which is great. Only 8 grams of sugar. It is filling and I would order these in the future.
positive,16/11/19,"These are actually pretty good. I was not expecting to like them (I don't like chocolate and coconut together) but I did! They are soft and chewy and great for a snack. They are wheat, gluten and dairy free, so they are pretty good for those with allergies or food sensitivities.<br /><br />Each bar has 180 calories, which is pretty standard. They do have 80 calories, or 9 grams, of fat, 2g of which are saturated. The rest of the contents are pretty good with 8g of sugar and 9g of whole grains. The ingredients are all things you can pronounce and has none of the weird chemicals.<br /><br />The bar is pretty chewy and tasty. I liked it and may even buy them."
positive,9/9/20,"These bars are a perfect, healthy snack for satisying a sweet tooth. They're moisty, chewy, and just sweet enough. They don't contain corn syrup and you won't miss the wheat or dairy."
positive,1/7/18,"This snack was tasty and seemed to be healthy. However, I would not rate it as being special or see myself making it a ""go to"" energy bar. Right now I prefer Clif Bars and PowerBars."
positive,10/8/18,Every pup I have ever owned LOVED these treats. They will do anything for them and only like this brand! I tried another and they refused to eat them! If you love your pups and treat them like children-BUY THESE!<br />Mine are not too spolied - DIVA and TIFFANY! They get them every holiday and I am never without a supply on hand. Try greenies too!
positive,15/1/20,forget cheetos! these are the best ever!  same price (or less if on sale) and better for you.  I could eat a bag by myself but the kids beat me to it!
positive,1/9/20,"I was able to try these chips from a food show sample, and I fell in love.  They taste great!  Plus they are much healthier than the average chip.  Definitely recommend this product.  Let's get these in stores!"
positive,22/7/21,"My parents love this stuff (and they're actually Asians, so that speaks volumes).  It's such an easy quick convenient food to stock up for them for whenever they drop in to visit me and I haven't nothing but ""white people"" food lying around.  But I'm sure that it'll go a long way toward feeding the starving college student types as well.  I think that it's a perfect combination of flavor for price.  But I have to admit that I would not purchase this item at Amazon as it is far more affordable if you buy from an Asian grocery.<br /><br />If you found this review helpful, please let me know."
positive,1/7/18,"I had this for lunch and I enjoyed the flavor and the spice level.  It was a little salty for my taste, but not too bad.  Some people suggest not to use the whole flavor packet to reduce the saltiness, but that would also reduce the amount of heat.  The bowl was easy to prepare and it was enough for me for lunch.  Given the hagh salt content and low nutritional value, I would eat this occasionally, not often, to satisfy a craving."
positive,10/8/18,Bought this in the Maui Costco and thought it tasted so great we dragged home the unfinished huge bag of oatmeal.  Went to our local Costco and they did not sell it but another type of cut oatmeal which is not nearly as good and a different texture.  This is a fine tasting healthy oatmeal.
positive,14/5/21,One of my favorites.....hopefully this continues at a reasonable price. Each k-cup brews perfectly. Well pleased.Will continue to order as long as it is a suscribe and save item.
negative,17/10/19,"I've fgound the cure for drinking too much coffee inthe morning. Get this one. I thought, when I first had this, that I had accidently wiped the sugar spoon with a Mr Clean cloth, but the next day, I had one cup of Tully's and made the second cup, the Green Mountain Breakfast blend. The disinfectant taste was back. I would not buy this one again."
positive,3/10/21,"I love this coffee it's my favorite so far I want to try them all. I don't like strong coffee and I hate bitter after taste coffee to me this is the perfect cup  of coffee. I'm not telling everyone to go out and buy it this is my own opinion."
positive,15/9/20,"This is the food my vet recommends.  It is produced about 40 or 50 miles away from where I live, and they source only local ingredients, nothing comes from China.  So it is a food I feel very comfortable with, I know that this company cares about my pet's health and takes it seriously.  And it is very reasonably priced at one of my local pet food stores.  Now, there are those who would point to the oats and vegetables and declare it unacceptable.  But my cat never throws up or has diarrhea with Eagle Pack.  He seems to do best on the Lamb variety and the Duck variety.  The Turkey one gave him slightly softer stools for some reason.  I think the price and quality make us both happy, for now.  I'd love to feed him the optimal diet (probably raw) but I still have some reservations about it that I would have to come to terms with, so for now, we're sticking with this."
positive,30/8/20,"For someone with a gluten problem this is the best spaghetti on the market, without a doubt."
positive,1/7/18,"How much can you say about a drink? It tastes pretty good! It's got a nice flavor, sweet, but not overly so and there's a good amount of fizz. There's a lot of sugar for the amount of drink you have, and at only 8.3 fluid ounces, there just isn't much there. What's there is good though!"
positive,10/8/18,"This is a good drink, tastes like soda, but fruity.  I really liked it, nice alternative to soda."
positive,5/12/19,"This is very good.  A nice berry flavor with just a hint of kiwi, and very sweet even with no added sugar. The fruit flavors are strong, but very natural, without the unpleasant mouthfeel and aftertaste some fruit beverages can leave you with.<br /><br />The carbonation is nice - it's not too bubbly, but just pleasantly effervescent.<br /><br />This is a product I would definitely buy at a convinence store instead of a soda, but I had to take away one star since I think it is a bit overpriced for what it is."
positive,21/10/19,"Let me start out by saying that one can of Switch just wasn't enough...at least not when you're sharing it!! In order to properly review this, I had my children join me in a little taste test of this product. Well, the best litmus test of whether something is good or not...is if your kids want more. And mine both did...but I wasn't sharing any more of this delicious drink. No sir, I'm happy to report that the remainder of this libation was imbibed by yours truly.<br /><br />I'm not generally of big fan of the carbonated juice drinks, but Switch could switch my mind. The kiwi-strawberry taste was just right...not too sweet and blended well with the carbonation for a drink that was tasty and refreshing. In fact, this drink would be great for a hot day or after a workout when you want something with some bite and don't really want or need another soda.<br /><br />This is good stuff...get some."
positive,8/9/20,"I have to admit, I liked the watermelon strawberry flavor better than this one, kiwi berry, but this was just as flavorful and just as pleasant. Just the right amount of carbonation and sweetness, and I really loved the fact this has no corn syrup or refined sugar. The small can size is also very handy because it's easy to slip into a bag and it's exactly one serving size. As I mentioned with the other flavor, this drink doesn't have a weird aftertaste or leave a lingering flavor on the tongue--it's very clean and refreshing."
positive,22/9/21,"Great combination of coffee, chocolate and raspberry flavors.  Stays fresh in the bag for a long time.  A bit more astringent than I usually like, but still very good."
positive,2/10/20,"I tasted this last week and thought it was excellent. The fact it has fiber is goodness. That said, I'll be going with the peach flavor because it also packs a bit of protein."
positive,25/7/20,I was a biscuit and gravy person before I found out that I was gluten intolerant.  This is the best biscuit mix I have found so far.
positive,4/7/21,"Not much to say- good stuff.  Amazon's grocery concept is great and I look forward to ordering more.  Now if only they offered Coffee-mate's Vanilla Chai Spice creamer.  That is some amazingly delicious powder right there.  Try it if you haven't yet!"
positive,11/9/21,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVIDUY"">The Gluten-Free Pantry Chocolate Truffle Brownie Mix, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />My daughter was recently diagnosed with a wheat allergy as well as some other allergies such as the hormones and antibiotics in milk and eggs so we have gone ""organic"" it has impacted our food choices but she is 5 and we did not want her to feel as though she was different. We began the search began for tasty treats that she could eat without pain.<br />We found this item and it is the most wonderful thing we could have tried for her! We throw in an extra egg and a bunch of chocolate chips. I have never been much of a brownie fan but these can fool even the most die-hard. They are fantastic. She loves them as do all of us! I feel like I should advertise for this company, absolutely amazing!"
positive,4/7/21,"This brownie mix is super easy to make.  You only add 2 ingredients to it, and it only takes a couple minutes from mix to oven.  It has real chocolate chuncks in the mix, which melts to make it a very yummy tasting brownie.  Even our friends who don't eat gluten free prefer these to regular mixes.  I always keep a case of this in the closet."
positive,21/9/21,"I have tried these and this is a very good mix, I add more chocolate chips and they were very chewy and moist."
positive,11/9/21,"This is a nice ground coffee and the price is very reasonable.  The grind is finer than what is normal for auto-drip makers, which is good because I can use less so it goes much further, making it even more economical.  I have purchased it on more than one occasion and would definitely buy again."
positive,12/10/21,"Buy it now, please. These are just great, with perfect flavor and texture. I keep them in the refer where they are even more refreshing. Try them with different things: in salads, with crudite, with good dark chocolate, with your tea in the morning, as we do. A+++"
positive,11/10/21,"Good substitute for sugar, I like it much better than stevia, which to me has an awful after-taste.<br />I did notice though that the Erythritol isn't quite as sweet as sugar which can make it just a little expensive."
positive,28/9/21,I could eat this right out of the jar.  I am using it to replace the natural oily peanut butter I use in my smoothies.  It is alot less messy and tastes delicious.  Even my husband is surprised. Luv it!
positive,19/10/21,"Love, love this item.  I bought the regular and chocolate and enjoy them both.  I mix mine equal parts powder a<br />& water and it is perfect on crackers, as a dipper or just off the spoon for a quick protein rich, low fat snack.<br /><br />I have also used it in protein shakes and diped raw apple and pear slices right into the powder too!<br /><br />Yum.<br />Try it!"
positive,4/7/21,"It really does taste good!  I don't like to measure anything... So if you put in too much water, you can just add more peanut powder to make it thicker.  Though, if you don't like the creamy kind of peanut butter and only like the chunky kind, this might not be for you."
positive,11/9/21,"I was sceptical of this product when I received it but was sold once I gave it a try.  A little bit of water and you have peanut butter that your diet will like!  It is great in protein shakes, baked items, or just to eat by the spoonful (reconstituted of course).  I have been reccommending it to everyone!"
positive,12/9/21,"These beans were really very good.  Added a ham slice while cooking and came out great.  Each time I've made the soup it's be consistently yummy!"
positive,13/7/21,"Our family loves these chips, they are light, not too greasy, and the seaweed taste is fantastic. My wife is from Japan so she turned us on to these chips."
positive,23/10/21,"I have been drinking Celsius now for around 6-8 months. Prior to that, I had tried several of the other energy drinks out there, and always regretted it later because of all the extra calories in them. When I first found Celsius, I figured it was too good to be true (it claims to actually burn up to 100 calories per can). While I cannot comment on the calorie burning effect, I do find it has a great taste, the best of any energy drink out there that I have tried, and does give me a ""boost"" of energy. I drink one every morning.<br /><br />Overall, I love this product. I will purchasing this from Amazon (which was almost $20 cheaper for the 24 pack than the store I normally go to) on a regular basis from now on."
positive,22/9/21,"This stuff is good, and I mean REALLY good. My husband drinks diet soda which contains aspartame, a known neurological toxin, and I wanted to provide a much safer alternative. I found this at PCC and he loved it. I can't STAND the taste of artificially sweetened things and I usually end up with a nasty migraine, and this didn't bother me one bit. The taste is fantastic in my opinion, but this seems to be a flavor you will either love or hate, which is why I would recommend picking up a 6 pack at the market before ordering a pack of 24."
negative,4/7/21,"Unfortunately I am highly disappointed with this product. It is devoid of flavor. They pride themselves on the history of the product. I could've done better at my grocery store in the candy aisle. I would've actually preferred a Heath bar. I tried it on three different days thinking possibly it was me. Then I had a couple friends try a couple pieces and my assessment was proved to be correct.<br />I threw away the majority of the two pound container one hour before the trash collectors arrived so the Raccoons (which often find their way into the garbage no matter what precautions you take) wouldn't have to suffer eating it.<br />What a waste of my hard-earned money. You'll notice if you search Google how dominant this company is.<br />Believe me, I nor will anyone I know ever waste a penny on this product again. Yes, this review seems harsh; but I rarely take the time to do this. The only reason I have, is so you don't waste your money.<br />Regards to all:<br />Ron"
positive,11/9/21,"This recipe is my favorite. I bought 5 boxes of this flavor during last years deer hunting season. Everyone who tried this was impressed with the flavor. I did add some liquid smoke, some salt, and additional cayenne pepper to some of my batches.  I make enough deer jerky to fill up (8) 1-gallon bags every season and this is by far the best I have tried to date"
positive,8/8/21,I received this product in record time.  I tried it once and ordered again in bulk and am hooked.  Love the product and the company is excellent as far as packaging and the swift arrival time of my purchase. I would recommend to all my friends.
positive,9/7/21,"I drink coffee in the morning for the kick. I ordered this coffee because the low-acid twist intrigued me. Promptly forgot about that aspect until it was time to reorder, which was sooner than expected because I started enjoying a second cup per day.  Yes, there's definitely something to the low-acid, as my stomach can tolerate two cups per day. But, I want that second cup due to the coffee's taste!  Quite flavorful, with good depth."
positive,24/10/21,"I found this while stationed in Italy, and really missed them when I moved back to the states.  I was discussing them the other night and decided to order some from Amazon.  They are still fantastic!  I eat them as a treat or as a pick me up when coffee is not available.  It is a shame they are not more widely available in stores.  The small amount of coffee filled with ground beans is a wonderful treat."
positive,4/7/21,"My puppy, a 14 week Bernese Mountain Dog, has a very sensitive stomach and frequent diarrhea, so she was on an expensive vet-prescribed diet for the first two weeks that I had her...eventually she needed a more growth-oriented food, so I switched her over to Eukanuba Large Breed Puppy (on the recommendation of the vet), but she still rarely had solid stools.  Also, each day, her coat seemed less shiny, she had a ton of dandruff, and scratched like crazy.  After only a week on Canidae (I'm gradually mixing more and more of it in, and decreasing the Eukanuba)-- she's stopped itching, and her poop is way more solid and far less frequent.<br /><br />I know there's no perfect pet food, but if you have a dog with a sensitive stomach and/or possible allergies (I'm thinking corn or another filler that Eukanuba and Iams uses?), Canidae could be a godsend.  It has  been for me.  Every dog deserves a better quality food than one with by-products and a ton of fillers, and some (like my pup) simply can't handle that low-quality stuff."
positive,11/9/21,"These pouches are the next best to homemade.  When I don't have time to steam and blend my own baby food, I always reach for happy baby!"
positive,24/10/21,My cats are very picky but they love this food. It is very dense and provides a large amount of good quality food for my two cats. I especially like the fact that there are garden greens inside the food. It is good for their digestion.
positive,22/6/21,I believe this is the same brand a lot of coffee shops use. Sugar free tastes great! At the price I paid it is worth having a coffee shop at home.
positive,30/7/21,"I have CHF with cardiomyopathy.  I have to limit my sodium to under 2,000 mg per day.  Because of great products like this ketchup - I can do that pretty easily most days!  My CardioElectroPhysicist had never heard of no-salt ketchup, he thinks it's great!<br /><br />Heinz no-salt ketchup tastes wonderful!  It has a slightly stonger tomato flavor, but I wouldn't have guessed it was no-salt.  I use it for homemade BBQ sauce, french fries, etc - it's awesome!  Highly recommended."
positive,10/7/21,"Tasty and simple, everyone loves a bite, so make an ugly one you can justify trying out"
positive,4/7/21,"This was not what I expected. It is very sweet with bits of candied orange rind and garlic but I really did not notice any chili. With chili in the title, I expected some heat but there was none.  Definitely needs heat."
negative,11/9/21,"Purchasing the Glace De Volaille Gourmet Gold Roasted Turkey Stock from Amazom. I used the reccomended old world gravy recipe of sauteing onions, carrots in duck fat with a cup of wine. It did not inspire me.  The traditional basted American Turkey with pan drippings for gravy cannot be substituted.  The aroma of a fresh turkey in the oven stirs the senses, exciting the cook to prepare for a perfect gravy.  This cannot be duplicated in a gravy package that is designed for a gourmet market that prefers its gravy, deaden in wine, brown onions and thyme. Maybe the old world tastes are more astute, but my American gravy will remain simply traditional.  The Glace De Volaille Gold Roasted Old World Gravy recipe, well it went into the trash."
positive,20/9/21,"I have suffered from heartburn for years and never thought that it might be due to the coffee I drink so I was very excited to give this a try.  I loved the taste of the coffee and my heartburn might have been a tad bit better, but it wasn't significant.  I guess it is possible that my heartburn is due to something other than the coffee I drink.  I would still recommend this product though because it is very good coffee."
positive,13/10/21,"I have been trying to find a good coffee that would not set off my ulcer and still tasted good. Puroast Low Acid Coffee French Roast is perfect for me. It tasted rich, full bodied and no harsh afterbite, AND it doesn't make my heartburn flare up. You will never miss anything this coffee has to offerr, except your heartburn!"
positive,2/8/21,"Preferences for type of coffee varies from person to person, so I'm not surprised some people like this brand and some do not. I drink coffee every day and have tried many different types. I've never tried low acid coffee before so was not sure what to expect.  In my opinion, this was very good.  It has a rich, dark roasted ""starbuck-like"" taste.  I recommend trying it."
positive,11/6/21,"I only got to drink one cup of this to make this review, but I thought it tasted great.  What I like about good coffee flavor is that earthy, rich coffee taste that comes from quality coffee and just being fresh brewed.  I tested this right after the coffee maker had finished so it was as fresh as it could be.  I like a little honey and fresh cream in mine and I was sad I only got to have just one cup.  I had to share with others at home and they all liked it as well.  I couldn't tell if anything tasted different since it is supposed to be low acid.  It tasted like regular coffee to me."
negative,2/8/21,"With both a stomach problem and a love of coffee, I thought this would be a great solution. I was wrong. I just didn't care for the taste. I recommend trying some low acid coffee once somewhere you can get a small cup before purchasing a 10-pack of bags for home brew. :("
positive,18/10/21,"I like these potato chips. They are very tasty and natural... I can not find them in Russia, and so I will order again and again from USA... :)"
positive,23/7/21,"I remember the old Shake N Bake commercial from when I was a kid (""It's Shake N Bake, and I helped!"") and was curious to try it again.  My sample pouch had enough to coat 6 boneless pork chops, each almost a half inch thick.  Each pouch is designed for 4-6 half inch thick bone-in or boneless chops.<br /><br />It was quick and easy to coat the chops in a zip lock bag after moistening the meat with water.  No messy clean up.  And the pork chops baked up tasty and moist in just a couple minutes more than the recommended 15 minutes.  I used a thermometer to check for the recommended 160 degrees.  The flavor of the coating enhanced and did not dominate the flavor of the pork and it was not too salty.<br /><br />For a quick weeknight meal, I will buy this."
positive,8/7/21,"I love this item, the pork cooks very tender and the shake n bake adds a great flavor, rather than eating plain pork.  A butcher recommends this to his customers.  A nice break from steak, chicken and fish."
positive,11/6/21,"I have been using Shake `n Bake with my chicken for year but never thought to use it with pork chops until they released the Original Pork flavor.  This product is as easy to use as their other products: pour the Shake `n Bake into a sealable bag: put the pork chops individual, shake and then put them in the oven.  The package says it can be used from four to six pork chops and after using it with four I would not be surprised if I could have been able to coat four more pork chops with one package.  The taste is so similar to the chicken version there were some bites when I forgot I was eating pork chops and was eating chicken with Shake `n Bake on it.  Much like the chicken version, the breading can fall off while cutting, but that is really the only negative I can say about the product."
positive,25/6/21,"I have only praise for this product.  I give it 4 stars and not 5 for it does not come with a bag.  It is called SHAKE N BAKE but there is no bag to shake it in!  Other than that this product is great.  It is so easy to use.  I used 4 nice thick boneless pork chops and after shaking the coating fully covered all four.  It only needs to bake for 15 minutes and the meat does not need to be turned over at all during the cooking.  I found the coating to be delicious.  It had a light seasoned taste that was very tasty without overpowering the taste of the pork.  The coating mix also kept the pork inside tender and moist without getting too crispy on the outside.  Just crispy enough.  It certainly added just the right flavor to the light taste of the pork.  I added baked potato, peas and a salad and had a very tasty meal.<br /><br />I hadn't used SHAKE N BAKE since I was a kid and then tended to use the chicken more.  I will definitely use this product on a regular basis now as well as give the chicken a go again.  Highly recommended.  Very easy and quick to use providing a delicious way to cook your pork."
positive,2/8/21,"I haven't used any Shake 'N Bake in years (and when I did use it, I used the version for chicken) so I was curious to see how the product was after all these years. I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised. It has a light flavoring - tasty, but doesn't overpower the flavor of the pork and using the coating kept the meat juicy. And it was very easy to use - like the name of the product says, shake on the coating and bake. It's easy to use and tastes good - it doesn't get any better than that."
positive,11/6/21,"We have used the pork pouch on porkt chops...and believe it or not...we have used it on chicken.  Both were juicy and had a great flavor.  Easy to use without a lot of mess...you can't go wrong with shake-n-bake."
positive,9/7/21,"Love this dip, my husband is nuts over it, has been eating it quite often since receiving the package.  All Wise products have been fantastic."
positive,22/6/21,"We all have our vices, mine has always been chips.  Specifically, Bettermade BBQ chips, so as I'm trying to eat healthier I've tried to find a replacement for that craving.  I decided to give the popchips a try, thinking if they were at least okay I could replace my cravings for them.  They are better than okay!  These little guys are full of flavor and crunch!  And not to sound like a pig, but I could eat a half a bag of Bettermade in one sitting, but these little 8 oz bags, even though they are small, they fill me up!  I was shocked!  I am not kidding, I am eating healthier, giving in to my craving, and getting full from one small bag.  You cannot go wrong with these, even my kids love them!  I am thrilled to have found a healthy alternative to fatty chips!"
positive,2/8/21,"These are super tasty treats for days when you want something crunchy and salty.  I didn't find them overly salty as some commented.  They are very good and I would buy them again and again if the price were lower.  I got them as a special (24 single serve bags for $14) and would buy again at that price just to keep around as snacks.  Each bag is 100 cals and you actually feel like you are getting a real bag of potato chips.  Yummy."
positive,11/6/21,These remind of a product called Munchos that I liked a long time ago in regards to flavor. Great crunch and salt level. I wish they packages a bit bigger than the 0.8 and smaller than 3 oz.  The 0.8 isnt quite enough and the 3 is too much. About 1.5 oz would be right for my appetite.
positive,8/7/21,"Can't find these in individual size packages locally so this has answered my family's needs.  Have tried most of the varieties, but we prefer the original flavor."
positive,28/9/21,"They arent too salt and vinegary, but still have the flavor of it.  Very good tasting.  Crispy."
positive,23/8/21,"I have tried every variety of Popchips and this one is by far my favorite.  The pepper gives it just the right amount of spice.  If you love your food to have a little kick to it, then you will love these chips!"
positive,1/8/21,"The first time I tried this I thought, wow, this is great! It's as satisfying as eating regular potato chips, but sweeter and presumably healthier. So had I written the review then I would have given it 5 stars. The reason I hesitated was that I took it with me to work, and the more I tried it, the more I began to question the sweetness. There's no question that sweet potatoes are slightly sweet, but I felt it only fair to let readers know that they might find this product to be TOO sweet. Hence the reason for the 4 stars. It is still quite good, but if you find sweetness to be cloying, you might not like this product for long. But all in all, I would still recommend it."
positive,16/7/21,"This syrup is a graet value!<br /><br />The bigger more expensive coffee shops use this same syrup to flavor their coffee drinks, with ""additional"" expense to the consumer.<br /><br />Bottles are plastic instead of glass for easier shipping to consumer.<br /><br />Have these auto shipped to my home every three months."
positive,2/8/21,"Great portion control, nice that you dont have to keep it in the fridge or freezer.<br />I'm reordering some right now :)"
positive,11/6/21,"CAUTION...DO NOT use ice cubes in any Zevia soda.<br />I am hooked on Zevia sodas because their tastes are not ""heavy."" Each flavored soda seems to have just the right amount of taste. Once you add ice, the taste seems to get watered down.<br />Zevia is my new soda of choice."
positive,26/6/21,"This is going to sound like a broken record but this stuff is great.  My German Shepard, like the others, has horrible food allergies.  I tried the Royal Canine Venison which was OK but when I tried this, my dog, who is never that excited about food, went crazy.  He loves the taste, his stool is finally solid and his coat has become shinier.  Yes it is expensive, but worth it!"
positive,20/8/21,"For fans of black licorice and Ouzo/Oghi, this candy is for you. Very natural tasting and a nice and interesting change from the usual mint. My grandmother got a pack and quickly needed me to buy 6 more, as we haven't been able to find a store that carries it in town"
positive,25/8/21,"Very fresh and tasty!  Will buy again soon.<br />Since I ordered it in Dec, shipping is a little later then estimate, better order it earlier."
positive,19/10/21,These are really tasty and make a great high protein snack.  I order them regularly and keep them in my desk drawer.  They are really filling and taste great.
negative,2/8/21,"I've eaten a few of these, and while they tasted interesting at first, I can't bite into one now without gagging.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I was looking for some high-protein snacks so I picked these up.  A vegetarian friend of mine tried one and instantly hated them, calling the taste ""disgusting"" and the texture ""too much like meat.""  The taste is not something that grows on you and I can not recommend these to anyone, especially at this price."
positive,11/6/21,"I was happy to see that I could purchase this on Amazon. Previously had to go to our local health food store. Price is about the same, more convenient to come to the house. High protein, low fat, tasty and give a energy boost on intense bike rides or anytime snack when you don't want a carb rush! :)"
positive,22/10/21,"We were pleasantly surprised at how good these tasted.  The %DV for sodium is 15, so while not excessive, we limit ourselves to ""one at a time."""
positive,6/8/21,I purchased this for some family members that only like instant coffee. They have really enjoyed this and I tried it and found out it has a great taste. I would recommend this to anyone that wants a great cup of coffee without having to make a full pot when they only want a cup.
positive,24/6/21,"Nescafe Taster's Choice Instant Coffee is as good if not better than the local coffee shops. Plus, Nescafe Taster's Choise cost less than 10 cents per cup. Ron Jones from Texas"
positive,17/4/21,"I've tried many of the various coffee sticks out there, but these are the best tasting. Not that strong, but not like water either. Perfect for me. To me it tastes like the coffee you get at the TGIF restaurants, so that's why I like it. Easy and tasty! Just how I like my women."
positive,10/3/21,"This Jam is amazing, great flavor...great texture and spreads well on anything.<br />Might I suggest to put it in some vanilla ice cream for your very own Huckleberry Ice cream...<br /><br />Definitely recommend this product...now only if i bought more...."
positive,17/4/21,"This cereal product is delicious and is a nice change from so many gluten-free cereals that have a cinnamon flavor. I really liked the fact that it is a high-protein cereal, which helps to control blood sugar levels."
positive,21/1/21,"I gave this product a try since being a gluten and dairy free person limits snacks, this tastes really good and its hard just to have a few.  I will continue to purchase this product."
positive,30/1/21,"You can add ground turkey to this and it tastes wonderful! I wasn't a big ground turkey fan until I tried it with this mix. If you don't have ground turkey, you can boil a chicken breast with skin in the 7 cups of water, then discard the bone and skin and add the mix. I've made it both ways and they're both good. I also tried it with ground beef but like it with turkey the best."
positive,13/2/21,"I don't know what possessed me to try this but am sure glad I did.  I made it per directions, just adding water and a can of tomato paste.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I didn't tell my SO there was no meat in it and thought it was awesome.  Couldn't believe the very low calories and high fiber.  A definite keeper and will be a staple in my pantry!"
positive,15/1/21,"My dog loves this food and it has really cut back on the tear staining issues.  The staining was a big problem and I did quite a bit of research to find a solution. I considered a few products that you add to the dog food or come in pill form and several of these apparently  work however many of them are actually antibiotics I am not sure it is a good idea to use very often.  My research  led me to antioxidants (like blueberries) and avoiding wheat to cut back on the tear stains and give him a healthier coat. This food is not only grain free but is also loaded with blueberries.<br /><br />Yes, the first ingredient is potato however in FirstMate's defense, most companies include several non-protein ingredients so that they can put them lower down on the list thus making it look like there is more protein than anything else.  Also, meat ""meal"" is a much more concentrated protein than regular meat (somewhere in the range of 300% more concentrated)."
positive,6/3/21,"This was their first product.  It is filtered, hence the clear color, and while doesnt have the same nutrients as their unfiltered product, for taste, it can't be beat. I would recommend to those trying to get off soft drinks and something (marginally) better."
positive,8/6/21,"This tea is amazing, I cannot believe the price. The price I paid is less than half of what other companies charge and this tea is delicious!  I love it.  FAST delivery too.  Great job!"
positive,7/1/21,"This is a quality rock candy product and a very large amount for the price. I would deffinately buy this product again, if needed. Purchased as a gift and the person was more than thrilled"
positive,17/4/21,Every year for the holidays I buy my brother a pack of these chai tea packets for him to use at university. he loves them!
positive,10/3/21,"Can you really ever go wrong with the most trusted name in oatmeal? In fact, can you ever really go wrong with oatmeal? It's pretty hard to screw up oatmeal. The only factor at play here is if you like the flavor. I really enjoy oatmeal but I hate the effort that it can take compared to getting a bowl of cereal. These instant packs take virtually no time and you don't have to mess with extra ingredients like brown sugar and maple extract, etc. They come in many different flavors and if you like oatmeal and you like brown sugar, this is a quick and easy way to satisfy your morning hunger."
positive,14/1/21,"The taste is great. The shipment came in fast. I love it, and so does my entire family. The beans are on the smaller side, but it does not matter to us."
positive,24/5/21,We have a standing order for the beef sticks but always run out before hand and must order sooner. Love them.
positive,14/10/21,"My husband complained that split peas didn't have any taste anymore.  He really likes these and said they taste like split peas used to taste.  Seem to be very good quality."
positive,7/2/21,This is great convenience to have on my counter next to my Keurig and Kcups!<br />I really think this is a great value too!
positive,29/3/21,"This tea has lots of flavors.  I first started loving Chai tea about 8 years ago.  I have tried many of the boxed liquid teas and I do like them.  I have preferred the brand Einstein bagles uses, but since I have a Starbucks close by, have grown to like the one they use as well.  My favorite is the ""masala"" tea made my a local Indian restaurant.  This most closely approximates that.  I am still trying to replicate it, but for now, this is the best I can do.  I really like this tea.<br /><br />As a bonus, if I forget to empty the basket when I leave work, when I get in the next day, the whole area smells great!"
positive,17/4/21,"It's tasty although they say ""a medley of oranges mingled with piquant leaves."" I also enjoy it because it's caffeine free, good for chilly nights."
positive,10/3/21,This is a great-tasting tea! The taste is not too strong or overpowering and not too weak. I will be purchasing more.
positive,10/7/21,"I love a good strong cup of morning coffee and this one comes as close to perfect as one can.  I usually set my machine to make a mug of coffee & the first cup I had of this brew tasted just a little stronger that my usual one.  I then dropped the cup size down one notch, made a second cup and found what I was looking for.  Tried my usual coffees with the smaller cup & they did not compare to the rich aroma & fine taste that I'm now getting with Revv"
positive,27/1/21,"Anyone shopping for chives in the grocery store knows how expensive chives are. I'm almost surprised restaurants don't charge extra for them. These chives are a ""steal"" compared to the grocery, and taste as good as McCormick's at probably a 1/4 of the price. Also the shipping was very fast. I would buy again without a doubt."
positive,1/6/21,Great tasting pecans though it would be great if they were larger.  Packing would have been better in boxes instead cos quite a few were turned to pecan dust.  I would buy again though since they are really good to eat as a snack or cereal topping.
positive,20/8/21,"This gluten-free bar is much better than most - a rich combination of just what it says - fruit and nuts.  However, the unit description is incorrect.  It is not 8 boxes but one box of eight bars."
positive,14/8/21,"This fruit and nut bar by KIND is very, very tasty.  Travels well, even in the heat.  No problem with melting or not being able to handle due to the heat.  Nuts do require chewing so would not recommend them to anyone with chewing issues ... otherwise, they are superb."
positive,21/4/21,This is a great cereal.  I could not find it for over a year.  I was on Amazon and just happen to search for the item and they had it.  I am so happy I can still buy this product.
positive,1/4/21,"If you like popcorn, you have to try this. We have an counter top popcorn machine and it work's great.<br />Try it you'll love it."
positive,17/4/21,"This Popcorn rivals that of movie theaters!  Even the so call people selling ""movie theater popcorn"" cannot hold a candle to this popcorn."
positive,10/3/21,"We have been using this product for over a year now and that should speak volumes because we are a popcorn loving bunch!  The convenience of having everything measured and ready to go at a minute's notice is great.  I have a popcorn machine in the media room and so we love to munch popcorn while watching movies.....we feel we are at a theater eating the ""real deal"".  I will continue to purchase even though it isn't the most figure friendly popcorn....taste outweighs the waist....tee-he."
positive,22/4/21,I would say this is the best tasting popcorn  have eaten.  It to me is better than movie thearte popcorn.  It has the right mixed of salt and oil to give it a really good flavor
positive,25/4/21,"I have a Waring Pro, and this stuff is fantastic. It is salty and buttery, and tastes like movie theater popcorn. Some complain it doesn't all pop, that's because some of the kernals are thrown out of the kettle while the others pop. It always fills the tray that comes with my popper all the way up. I love it."
positive,1/4/21,We use these popcorn packs for our party rental business. We can keep enough in stock. They are easy for our customers to use and taste great!
positive,30/6/21,Great taste and easy to use. I did find that if you let the package soak in hot water for a few minutes before use it makes the oil come out of the package easier.
positive,1/3/21,"This popcorn tastes great.<br />Its so easy, just cut off the top and pour in the contents.<br /><br />I'll for sure be buying more of this popcorn!"
positive,29/1/21,"This popcorn tastes great. The only complaint I have is that it is way too salty (and we like salty). All we do is pour out a tiny bit of salt before adding it to the kettle and it's perfect."
positive,17/4/21,"I use this with a Whirly Pop and it is a great combination!  As others have said...tastes and smells just like theater popcorn, due to the use of coconut oil.  Very few un-popped kernels, and total cooking time is just about 3 minutes on medium heat.  I just dump the whole packet into the popper and start cranking.  I don't think it matters if you dump only the oil first, even though it is pretty thick, but once heated it thins out.<br /><br />I will not use microwave popcorn anymore.  The taste can't be compared to this, no matter what brand you buy.<br /><br />We have a large family and have tried all sorts of brands of microwave popcorn, and none come close in taste to this.<br /><br />I would estimate that one 4oz pack makes just short of 2-3.5oz microwave popcorn bags.<br /><br />*Update* 8/25/11<br /><br />Ok, here is the scoops on this product.  I have tried to duplicate the taste by buying coconut oil, popcorn and flavacol salt flavoring.  Cooked it exactly the same.  The taste is close, but nope...not as good as this product from Great Northern.  Of course the final price is cheaper if you mix it yourself, BUT...the end taste is not as good.  I have tried the Act II buttery flavor popping oil instead of the coconut oil, and still the taste is not the same as this.  I often use Whirl butter topping on my popcorn, which tastes fantastic - but these bags from Great Northern don't need a thing as far as topping.  Trust me.  You will not go back to microwave popcorn again.  While cooking, you will swear you are in the movie theater!"
positive,10/3/21,"got a popcorn machine as a gift for a basement family room.  have tried a few different popcorn oil products and been disappointed with the taste.  probably a little pricier to buy everything prepackaged this way, but the best flavor we've found.  very happy with our purchase & will definitely buy again!"
positive,30/5/21,Bigelow Vanilla Caramel tea is the most delicious tea I have ever tasted. I  use Silk soy creamer with the tea to add an extra vanilla taste. I make my 5 cup pot of tea every morning using 3 bags of the Bigelow caramel tea with 2 bags of Bigelow decaffeinated English tea. I like my tea slightly decaffeinated. I wish you made a decaffeinated caramel vanilla tea because the taste would probably be mind blowing.
positive,28/9/21,"chewy, tasty, just the right amount of brazil nuts, and love using the little hammer to break apart the toffee"
positive,6/5/21,"This tea is really quite good. It is a quality black tea with a subtle cinnamon flavoring. Definitely one of my favorites!<br /><br />As with many food items sold on Amazon, I would recommend trying a single box from your local retailer (if you can find it) before committing to a whole six-pack. Once you know you like it, however, the value of this offering really can't be beat anywhere!"
positive,20/4/21,"This is, hands down, the best gluten free bread mix on the market.  If you're on a gluten free diet and make your own bread, you have to try this."
positive,20/4/21,"I really enjoyed this product.  It's very easy to mix and bake.  The taste and texture are very close to that of a wheat flour based bread."
positive,21/4/21,"I like these bars, but would rank them second to the Think Thin peanut butter variety.  Those are great.  These are very good.  Both offer up a good amount of protein for people who need more in their diet, such as vegetarians."
positive,2/5/21,"What I enjoy most with this variety pack is the 11 varieties. I don't get bored with just 1 flavour and there are some flavors I cannot find locally."
positive,18/12/19,"Outstanding product.  The greattea gives me a warm comfotable feeling and makes my senses come alive  The bags are quite large,that's a good thing because I get a bigger cup of tea with full flavor.  Just Fantastic!!!"
positive,19/1/20,First time we have used Chebe produce.  We loved it.  Has great taste and easy to make.  Will buy again.
positive,19/1/20,Awesomely tasty cereal.<br />Cocoa Beach is my favorite all time and also by Kashi.<br />Kid cereal for adults.<br />SCHWEET
positive,31/3/20,"I loved this cereal, so did all the family.  We just can't have it any more due to dietary restrictions, too much sugar.  Would love to have in the house again!"
positive,18/12/19,"This is a great BBQ sauce that even our kids really like.  A little kick, but not spicy.  Great alternative for those looking for a low carb product without chemical sweeteners."
positive,13/10/19,"This is genius!<br /><br />I purchase Angel hair first and after that bought a big box of angel hair and fettuccine! The product is AMAZING! Don't get fooled by all these negative reviews!<br /><br />If you like Asian food, you probably already know that their pasta doesn't taste like American/European kind. it has a different texture and taste. So these noodles taste exactly like the ones you order at Big Bowl :)<br /><br />The comments about the smell are ridiculous! How many raw uncooked food smells good? Are you kidding me? For instance, I love steamed broccoli but it smells bad while steaming! :)<br /><br />PLEASE follow the instructions: rinse in cold water for at least 15 seconds and boil for one minute, dry in paper towels. if you don't follow instructions, you will ruin ANY food, even your most favorite!<br /><br />Since the pasta is 0 calories, I finally could indulge myself with a really good pasta sauce ( no low fat anymore ) or some seafood Alfredo! the possibilities are endless. Please note that the noodles even better the next day since they easily absorb all flavors.<br /><br />Absolutely delicious and guilt free!"
positive,28/9/20,"People who complain about smell need to read and educate themselves. Yes when you open it smells that's how they are packed. All you have to do is rinse, yes read instructions. Then i throw in a skillet for a bit usually with garlic and  seasoning because i did find hard to pat dry. If you throw in a skillet for a few it takes the step where you pat dry away. There is no smell. just eat however you want. Just don`t write negative comments if you don`t read the site or directions. The site alone will answer any questions quickly. M"
positive,16/11/20,"I was having trouble locating apple chips locally and was happy to find these at a good price Amazon.  I love the chicken salad a chain restaurant sells that have apple chips on top and wanted to try to replicate the recipe at home. These work well and taste great.  The only issue I have is that they really aren't the healthy option I thought.  They contain oil and sugar, bringing the calorie content to 375 per bag.  It is better to eat an apple, but these are a mighty tasty snack."
positive,27/2/20,"I love these biscottis. They are 15 calories each and taste wonderful. Because there are so few calories these falls under a diet product which means they aren't cheap. However I got them here for about 30% less than the other vendor I used online."
positive,26/2/21,"Justin's individual nut butter packs are delicious and perfect for back packing trips! I bring them every time without dissatisfaction. Highly recommended product."
positive,18/12/19,"I've tried so many different Jasmine teas and this one is my favorite. There are some I just do not like. This brand has a wonderful flavor. I have been drinking this for about 5 years now, it is a good deal if you buy this from Amazon on auto ship. You can't beat the price."
positive,19/1/20,This tea is very refreshing and I love the mint flavor.  I use it for ice tea.  I especially like this brand of tea.
positive,13/9/20,"I love these bars!  This is a smaller company producing an EXTREMELY high quality product.  You get what you pay for, I'm glad to pay for such a great product and will continue to purchase these.  Thank you for such an outstanding product!"
positive,10/7/20,"These tomatoes seem very soft for dried tomatoes, which is great! They are also very flavorful. I've been using them in a coconut curry and I don't even bother soaking them to soften them, I just throw 5 of them (five halves) in the vita-mix with everything but the coconut milk, blend for a minute and then simmer together with the coconut milk. Delicious! I originally purchased these because I had some raw food recipes that called for quite a bit of dried tomatoes and these seem nearly perfect for that (the thing that makes them less than perfect to me is that they aren't organic) but 3 pounds is still so much I gave one bag to my boyfriend who thinks I'm weird for giving him a pound of dried tomatoes but once I give him the coconut curry recipe he'll be thanking me.<br /><br />Oh, and the bags zip lock shut after they're opened, which is a nice touch."
positive,14/4/21,"I can't say if it gives sustained energy as I just had my first pack.  I will say they were crisp and tasted great!  I'm always looking for portable energy food that is NOT low calorie.  These are about 230 calories per pack and since I take snacks like this hiking/backpacking, that's a good thing.  So far, I really like them.  Perhaps I'll update after I take them hiking and see how they hold up."
positive,24/4/21,"If you love chocolate and fruits, this is the product for you. I have just finished my first bag, and I still can't get over the taste. The candies are bite-size, and (even though I hate using cliches) you simply can't get enough of them. The chocolate doesn't taste bitter, but it's not too sweet either, and the pomegranate enhances the flavor with a slightly sour touch. Overall, just like those commercials say, your mouth will thank you."
positive,28/4/21,bought these at costco for a few cents less and figure they will either double in price or never be in stock again glad to know they are here on amazon  They ARE addictingly good..the deep dark chocolate flavor is haunting.  I was looking for choc cherries but these will do nicely
positive,12/7/21,"I bought this chocolate for my parents as a gift. They loved it, it has a little sour taste and good quality of chocolate."
positive,18/12/19,"This makes a good, quick and sustaining meal with flatbread or rice.  We have found that adding liquid such as milk converts it to a very tasty soup.  I could undoubtedly make something better with fresh ingredients but that is not always feasible and for convenience and reliability the KOI line is hard to beat."
positive,19/1/20,"I found this product at a little tiny store. I bought it figuring what the heck. My hair is damaged and a little bit fried. this product gave me shine, it calmed most of my frizzies, and a wonderful subtle scent to go with it. i love this product...the only down side is its a little bit hard to find."
positive,28/4/21,"This is pretty good tea.  I use it to make iced tea.  I will usually use two of these tea bags with a few of the cheap plain tea bags in order to make mango tea that doesn't taste like mango juice.  Good stuff at a great price."
positive,8/8/20,Received my order of Honey Pepper Jerky a couple days ago.  The jerky is sweet and the pepper is very good without being overwhelming. I generally prefer jerky that is very dry and chewy but I really enjoyed the taste and texture of this product.  I would not hesitate to order again or recommend to others.
positive,22/5/21,"This is a very nice hot cereal. The five grains give it a somewhat nutty flavor and a more complex texture than regular oatmeal, and it's quick to cook on the stove at only about 6 minutes. I like adding Wyman's frozen blueberries and strawberries (I add those when the oatmeal is done cooking but the heat is still on, so the frozen fruit can thaw a bit) as well as a bit of maple syrup and milk. mmm mm mm."
positive,18/12/19,"Is this the healthiest breakfast?  No.  Of course not.  But does it taste great?  YES!  I have a 45-minute commute, and drinking my chocolate protein shake makes the drive much more enjoyable, and cuts down on my getting-ready time in the morning at home.  I have one for breakfast every day, and my husband has one for lunch every day.  We love them!  I prefer the chocolate, and my husband drinks the vanilla and strawberry.  Neither of us love the dark chocolate.  Definitely try these!"
positive,19/1/20,"This is a tasty treat--with a thin layer of sugary jelly in the middle.  No oozing jelly or anything as I have initially thought.  For 16 pcs, I think this item is too expensive and would not buy again."
positive,3/8/20,"I am quite fond of these bars.  They aren't full of nasty ingredients like most commercial cereal bars.  The only downside is that they don't fill me up at all.  They are good as a snack, but I can't eat these for breakfast without being hungry soon afterwards."
positive,29/7/21,Great way to keep fruit in your diet. If you follow Weight Watcher this is a good snack for you. Three point and you get more fruit in your diet.
positive,8/7/20,We use this as a base for sauces and in soups and other meals. Its very flavorful and delicious! Its even a good price with Subscribe and Save. Would buy again!
positive,13/4/21,"This sauce is awesome.  I went on a month long quest for the next best table hot sauce.  I read a million reviews from different hot sauce sites only to order product after product and finding it flavorless, under-powered, over-powered, or simply disgusting.  This is THE most versatile hot sauce out there.  It makes a fantastic table sauce as well as an excellent marinade for some wings.  It showcases the cayenne and garlic without making the cayenne or garlic so much that it's unwelcome.  It is an immediate medium burn and should satisfy anyone seeking a nice well rounded table sauce.<br /><br />BTW:  These independent hot sauce reviews (non-Amazon) were hard to go through.  A lot of them are video reviews.  Why do people reviewing hot sauce think we want to see them eating hot sauce on a cracker over a crappy webcam.  And then they review the sauce while continuing to munch on a mouthful of hot cracker.  Gross..."
positive,20/2/21,"I discovered Ambrosia custard while in Ireland and absolutely love the subtle taste and smooth texture.  Ambrosia is a great light dessert when looking for something with minimal sugar, and the taste better than Birds, imo.  I would like to be able to purchase it in the aseptic boxes sold in the UK but am happy it's available at Amazon."
positive,9/12/20,I add this to sugarfree cappuchino and it tastes great.  It tastes just like the brands in the gas stations when I get a cappuccino there.
positive,1/4/21,"I ordered this jerky because it was the best price per pound and I had never had Brown Sugar Jerky.  It was surprisingly good.  The jerky was not too dry and didn't have an overly sweet taste.  I would recommend this as an option on road trips or as a snack that increases your daily protein intake.  I have even added this to Amazon's program that automatically sends it to you each month.  I definitely got my money's worth."
positive,25/2/21,I used these as a healthier option than chocolate for some cake pops. The yogurt is strong and tasty. I would buy again.
positive,18/12/19,"I got these from the grocery store when I couldn't have milk because of the baby. I had to have some chocolate. This is some really tasty chocolate. I mean real good. I can have milk now, but I still buy these. Love em'!"
negative,19/1/20,"Searching for a replacement for Ghirardelli's excellent but discontinued Expresso Escape bars, I tried these.<br />Unfortunately I ordered 12 of them.<br />I tried parts of 4 of these and could NOT detect ANY hints of chocolate OR coffee in any of them. I kept trying them because I could not believe what I was NOT tasting.<br />Ended up throwing the rest away."
positive,14/10/20,"This cereal has no artificial sweetners, is high in fiber, but has a great taste (A hard combination to find)."
positive,10/3/21,"I am becoming one of Goya's biggest fans. I had seen these on the shelves,<br />and they were really inexpensive, but I opted for a test can of Vienna<br />sausages instead. They were so good I went back the next day to get this<br />tin of sardines.<br /><br />They have a great sardine flavor, not fishy or oily at all, and the tomato<br />sauce is thick and rich. I am of the opinion that sardines make everything<br />taste better, and these go great just on a regular saltine. Great for snacks<br />or a pack lunch or road trips. I'll probably edit this review sometime in<br />the next month to give this product 5 stars cause I see addiction ahead. LOL"
positive,15/8/21,This has been my staple breakfast cereal for a couple of years now. I love the taste.
positive,27/4/21,"Very delicious cookies, both  sweet and crunchy.  I got these for Christmas gifts to go along with tea.  I think the receivers will really enjoy these."
positive,24/1/21,"I've purchased the lemon, raspberry and shortbread cookies and liked them all. What I like the most about the brand of cookies is that they are not too sweet--perfect for my taste."
positive,14/7/20,"New look, but same taste !!<br />A wonderfull cup of tea whit black cherry berry flavor<br />it's a must to have."
positive,5/6/21,"This does not taste at all like ""cough syrup"" as the other reviewer stated.<br /><br />This is the best gum out there and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I am not a plant, I live in Austin, TX and bought a pack of this in San Antonio - I just ordered a box on Amazon.<br /><br />This and the Lemon are the best flavors Orbit makes.<br /><br />John"
positive,9/7/21,"My cat loves it. My neighbour's cat loves it. Just be aware that feeding fish product exclusively is unhealthy for your cat. I think aside from this pack, you should also get the chicken,etc. pack for a balanced diet."
positive,5/6/21,"""GREAT taste"". Great taste, dissolves well, etc. Highly recommend. I can sometimes buy at Kroger. I usually add to more wter than recommended. THANKS Hansen!"
positive,25/7/21,"I use this powder to make the Jamba Juice equivalent of the Matcha Green Tea Blast. It does a great job in reproducing the taste. I'd recommend this supplier!"
positive,13/7/21,"Best tasting agave so far and I've tried many of the popular store carried brands."
positive,9/7/21,"I never realized this, but the salt and mineral concentration of seawater is different in each part of the world, and therefore the taste of sea salt varies based on where it comes from.<br /><br />To me, ""French gray"" sea salt is delicious - the flavor is more gentile than regular salt and has a slightly tangy taste with just a hint of minerals.  The price may seem high compared to table salt, but Amazon's price is low compared to other places I've bought it. Definitely worth it, in my opinion.<br /><br />One thing to note is that this sea salt is very moist, so it doesn't work well in a grinder or shaker.  Sometimes I'll serve it in a salt cellar, but generally I just keep it in a glass jar by the stove for cooking and use regular salt at the table."
positive,8/7/21,"This is a fantastic product!  My bull terrier was capable of spitting out a pill no matter what it was inserted into...peanut butter, steak, chicken, hot dogs...you name it, I've tried it.  Now he patiently waits while I get his pill ready and gulps it down...absolutely amazing!  I will never be without this product!!!"
positive,15/7/21,"I read the bad reviews on this coffee and am glad that I didn't let them dissuade me from buying this product.  I like the Natural Fusions vanilla coffee by Starbucks and this one is just as good.  It's a pleasing coffee with subtle caramel undertones.  I'll buy it again in the future if it's available."
positive,6/7/21,"My name is Patrick, and I am an American shorthair of indeterminate age and semi-discriminating tastes.  My human asked me to write this review for the Instinct Raw Boost Bites: Chicken Formula she got through the Vine program because she is unable to sample them herself.<br /><br />I gobbled up the portion my human gave me right away.  As far as I'm concerned, these deserve two paws up.  My housemate Tiger, also enjoyed the Bites.  She has a more discriminating palate than me, but she liked these just fine.  We think they compare favorably to other feline brand  snacks, like Pounce and Temptations.  Each piece is larger than say, a Pounce pellet, which our human broke into smaller pieces, so one or two make a more than adequate snack.<br /><br />According to my human, the package says that the treats are grain-free and are made from ""minimally processed, freeze dried raw ingredients.""  Ingredients include chicken, turkey, vegetables like butternut squash and broccoli, ground flaxseed, salmon oil, and mixed tocopherols with citric acid (?).  I'm not entirely sure what all that stuff means, but I would recommend the Bites to other cats who enjoy chicken flavored snacks that are meant for cats."
positive,13/8/21,Much more buttery taste than all other light butter popcorns.  By far the best light popcorn I have tasted.
positive,5/6/21,"Some of the best coffee I've ever had. Smooth AND full of flavor. It does get a little bitter if you weaken it too much, but any coffee will."
positive,9/7/21,"I need a filler and this was on sale at the moment for $6.5 for 6 it's worth it.<br />Add water, chicken, potatoes, carrots, and mumble jumpbo. Result is good and tastety.<br /><br />Individual package serve about 2 meals and it can not be save for long after opening, so plan carefully."
positive,17/6/21,"Love this stuff. I bought it cause it was cheap but it tastes great. It actually comes from India and the ingredients on the package are all things I can pronounce and recognize. I've been eating indian food for a long time and this was my first successful attempt to make it at home. Love it."
positive,31/8/21,Simply put these packets are easy to use and yield a good result when you want Indian in a pinch. I modified the recipe on the packet by adding chopped onion and some leftover roasted potatoes making the result more of a complete meal.  The salt content is a little high but overall the quality is excellent for a concentrate.
positive,7/8/21,I received my two boxes of coffee quickly in and in perfect condition.  This is the best deal I have found for this and will be purchasing coffee this way in the future.
positive,6/9/21,"I've been drinkin this coffee for about three months, and in my opinion it is the best coffee I've ever tasted!!! I used to wake up with headaches almost every morning and now the aches are gone, I have LOST weight about 10 pounds....10 POUNDS! and what I really like about this coffee is that if I don't drink it for a couple of days I wont get those ""I need cafeine"" headaches in the morning."
positive,5/6/21,"I gave half of the 6 pack to my friend visiting from Tokyo. We both love them. Although, it would be nice if they came in bigger cans."
positive,9/7/21,These almonds are so yummy! I ordered them online because both of my stores were always out. Walmart and Target is where I get them. I go through these very quickly. I like spicy foods so to me they are not hot but just right.
positive,19/6/21,Love the taste not to hot but a little tangy.  Price is good and really good service.
positive,5/9/21,"These almonds just have a great flavor.  Just the right amount of heat.  It's hard to stop eating them.  Good thing my wife is here to stop me."
positive,10/10/21,"I love the strength and taste of PG Tips. I grew up in England drinking this tea - and when I came to America in 2001 I just could not drink the weak tasteless tea that was being sold on the supermarket shelves - I have introduced my wife and friends to this tea - they now can't drink anything else!"
positive,29/9/21,"I like this flavor a lot. When I make this I add about 1/4-1/2 cup of regular old fashioned oats. It makes it not quite so sweet and I like the texture of the non-instant oats. I just add water and cook in microwave for 3 minutes. I have no idea what someone said meant about the fake flavoring smell lingering for a week. I didn't have any problem with the smell."
positive,11/9/21,"I am very happy with this product. It tastes really yummy and doesn't have lots of ""extra"" ingredients. I love the variety in the Ella products and that my baby is getting lots of healthy foods in one meal. Also, it is very easy to just squeeze it onto a spoon to feed. No mess!"
positive,5/6/21,This is an great green tea choice if you like a blend of different teas.  I thought it was well-balanced and tasted great overall.
positive,9/7/21,"I've tried other root beer popsicles before, but they were not as close to being as good as A&W's. It was very easy. I just put them in the freezer, and then after dinner my family eats them."
positive,26/8/21,"This cheese had a great smoked flavor, not over powering as some can be. It worked very well with must of my grilled recipes."
negative,26/7/21,"I was quite excited to try these cocoa roasted almonds out. I love almonds and I love chocolate. And most reviews of this product imply that you get your fix of both, without the extra sugar.<br />Well there's definitely a whole lot less sugar in this thing - it tastes pretty bad to me. And I was quite shocked. I guess I need at least a little more sweet. But I'm shocked because I'm not THAT much of a sweet tooth. It's the bitter after-taste that really bothers me with this product. I really couldn't take it.<br />So just fair warning to those who might think this is going to be a great combo of chocolate and almond. Think again! This is really just cocoa and almond, and, for me, that left a very bad taste."
positive,11/9/21,"These almonds make a good snack. The cocoa coating isn't sweet -- in fact, it's vaguely bitter -- and it isn't overpowering. The nuts themselves were good and fresh. My wife and I both liked them.<br /><br />On the other hand, my daughter said ""I don't hate them, but I don't love them either."" Save these for the adults -- they'd work well with red wine or sweet cocktails."
positive,11/9/21,"I like these.  Like the packaging too.  These are not chocolate dipped, but cocoa powdered.  And the flavor is cocoa, not chocolate.  Very sweet.  Probably good because a few go along way.  Very flavorful."
positive,15/9/21,"These are exactly what they say they are- cocoa roasted almonds.  People expecting an overly sweet, chocolate covered almond are going to be disappointed.  They do contain artificial sweeteners which seem to be one of the biggest complaints, but I'd also counter that with the argument that normal chocolate covered almonds have it too.  Overall, they're sweet, but not overtly so.  A good snack for people looking for a slightly less sugar loaded version of a sweet almond."
positive,5/6/21,"Love this Sauce. Taste is perfect, I use this Sauce with so many food but mostly with macaroni cheese so Go for it. Best Sauce...!!!"
positive,9/7/21,"Love the taste of this sauce. We have been using this for over a year. Great price, good quality, using this makes the pasta very yummy. A great buy."
positive,14/9/21,"I purchase several types of snacks for my hubby and I but find this product to be one of our favorites. It has lots of sesame sticks, which we love. Also the idea that four packages are included in the price is a good buy. I would definitely buy again."
positive,29/9/21,"My husband loves these granola bars.  He uses them to satisfy his sweet tooth and his chocolate cravings and I don't mind because they're a lot better than eating a candy bar.  The price is a decent savings from what I've seen in stores but I haven't been able to find this particular kind locally anymore so I'll continue to buy from here."
positive,10/7/21,Highly recommend this flavor pack.  Absolutely love each of them.  My 5 and 7 year olds love them.  So glad I went with these vs the other brand.
positive,1/3/20,"Love the Hawaiian Shaved ice flavors and so do my kids.  They have a rich not watered down taste that you can't beat."
positive,28/7/20,"This is by far the best product on the market. I have purchased this item several times and have never been disappointed. One time my Lab got to the package before me and he enjoyed it as well, but seemed to prefer the cherry the most. Hawaiian Shaved Ice Syrup is awsome. Its number one at my house for the kids and sometimes my dog."
positive,28/7/20,We had a yard sale and sold snow cones with Hawaiian Shaved Ice snow cone syrups! It was a huge hit! I especially liked the choice of 10 flavors...I will definetly be ordering more as we will be having several more yard sales before the season is over!
positive,10/11/19,"We decided to try our hand at snow cone making this summer since the money we spent last year at our local stand could have bought a small house!  This was our first purchase of syrup, and we are so pleased with the quality.  It tastes exactly the same as what we have enjoyed in the past.  The banana is delish, and my kids have loved every flavor we have tried thus far!  Wonderful product!"
positive,1/3/20,"As a hot drink, this made a great alternative to tea.  It's spicy and somehow refreshing.<br /><br />It tastes mostly natural, and it's said to be, but I did not have retail packaging - nor are the ingredients listed online - so I have no idea what is actually in the product, and I would want to know for sure before buying very much of it.<br /><br />I also would like to try it in carbonated water to see if one can make a more naural, less sugary ginger-ale."
positive,3/8/19,"This Ginger Lemon Drink is a foil packet of instant powder that only needs a cup of boiling water to make a hot tasty very flavorful drink.  With the honey already included, it is excellent if you feel a scratchy throat or sniffle coming on.  I think you will like it as much as I did."
positive,6/2/21,"I love ginger, especially the crystalized ginger candy and this beverage tasted just like those candies to me.  I tried it hot and cold.  I love it both ways, but maybe the cold a bit more.<br />How nice it would be to take some of these packets on any type of trip that would get me sick from motion sickness.  It tastes so good, that I'd drink it just because, but to know it's good for my digestion makes it all the better.  If you like the taste of ginger, you'll love this drink.  Tastes so natural and good."
negative,24/2/21,"I only had one packet to test of this product and I put it into a 8oz. glass of hot water. It is mostly ginger flavored with just a hint of lemon. The ginger is so strong that it actually tastes a bit like sweetened pepper and it leaves a kind of nasty taste in your mouth after it goes down. Perhaps, it might be better if you only added a bit of the packet to tea, or only used a bit of the packet in the water because, the ginger is very overwhelming. I was hoping for more lemon flavoring to balence out the ginger. This probably is good to settle the stomach, IF you can stomach the flavor....so this won't be a product that I'd use again."
positive,13/5/21,I received this product as part of the Amazon Vine Program.<br /><br />Excellent taste and wonderful to take with you. I get just order some hot water at any restaurant and bring my own pack.
positive,1/3/20,"Milo was my daily equivalent of coffee back in Singapore, but now that I moved to the US, I was shocked to find that the grocery stores near where I live does not sell this drink. So I was glad to find it on Amazon and it tastes as great. Reminds me of home too :) I hope it gets restocked soon though ._."
positive,28/7/20,I liked this a lot and will keep this in my tea stock.  The Bergamot is strong and compliments the full bodied earl grey tea well.
positive,13/5/20,"Very pleased with the smooth, not-too-weak, slightly bolder taste of this Yuban Dark Roast.  Right where I like the taste of my coffee, at a price point that I can enjoy as well.  Low acidity too.  Perfect!"
positive,26/3/21,"Very tasty...Our family loves this soda.  I especially like that it's all natural! No HFCS.  It's very light and fruity and not too sweet.  It has a very pleasant light pink color."
positive,29/8/19,I love coconut and I love cashews. If I could eat only those to things for the rest of my life I would die happy. This is a great bar if you enjoy coconut flavor/cashew flavor.
positive,7/2/21,"well, i'm just going to go on faith that the 5 carbs = 5 carbs.  I don't have a lab at my house. And it tastes great!"
positive,14/10/21,"So far I like this cherry juice best.  I was expecting it to be thinner and watered down compared to the concentrate (I had been mixing Tart is Smart concentrate 1/2 cup per Qt of water which I believe is what they suggest) but this tastes much better and stronger.  Perhaps tastes better because it tastes stronger to me.  The tart cherry juice works better than Glucosamine for me, my knees creak far less and I am much more limber when I wake up.  I can't say anything about sleeping better as I slept fine before I started drinking cherry juice."
positive,7/8/20,It works and the taste is very pleasing. I will order again to get through those occasional sleepy afternoons. Works faster than a cup of coffee.
positive,1/3/20,"My 7 months old enjoys all earth's best products so I decided to get this one too. He really likes it although I think his favorite is apples and apricots. Like all the other products I bought from this brand, I wasn't disappointed."
positive,28/7/20,The best coconut water...it is much better in the bottle than the paper box. I would recommend it. It even tastes great at room temperature.
positive,14/9/21,"The taste is really good - I do love coconut, but this has just enough balance where the coconut does not overpower. It helps with my heartburn as well."
negative,17/12/20,"It does not taste like pure coconut water,Its taste like some drink with coconut flavour. I wouldn't prefer these bottles instead i would go for zico smaller packs. they taste better than these bottled drink."
positive,2/5/20,"So healthy and good for you, and it tastes great. I know that's a personal view, but this is my favorite of all the coconut waters I have tried. No added sugar, and so not too sweet.<br /><br />The pack of six x 33.8oz cartons are great value too."
positive,14/7/21,"I took a few sips of this stuff, and couldn't help but wonder what all the 5* reviews were for. To me, the taste kind of reminds me of those chocolatey breakfast shakes.<br /><br />However, by the end of the bottle my opinion was completely changed. It has a very good, sweet chocolate taste. Even better, this stuff is killer for hangovers. I was walking around with a headache and general malaise all day - picked up one of these, drank it, and within an hour or two my headache and general unease was completely gone. I'm sold on this product."
positive,18/7/19,"zico probably has the best taste of the coconut water brands I've tried.  This passion fruit flavor is great, refreshing & not too sweet.  I'm not a fan of the unflavored kinds.  I've tried zico's mango but prefer the passion fruit over it."
positive,1/3/20,Very tasty and filling if you are watching your diet.  It has a lot of flavor and satisfies that craving for chocolate....
negative,28/7/20,"I was excited to find ZICO on auto delivery, but really disappointed in the new packaging and recipe.  I ordered 2 boxes and they had a plastic after taste.  I thought maybe it was just this batch...so I waited for my next order. Same thing taste like plastic and made from concentrate.  It use to be so good!<br /><br />Cancelled my subscription today!"
positive,13/6/20,"Not sure where all the bad reviews are comming from, I bought two cases to take camping with me. The first bottle tasted just as good as the last."
positive,10/3/20,"Came quickly, tastes good and pops well.  I like the separate flavor package for easier use.  I'm ordering a second case."
negative,9/5/20,consistency is ok but product is absolutely tasteless - might be possible to add to other cereals but not much fun to eat by itself
positive,14/5/19,"These banana nut bars are soft and chewy, with a nice banana bread flavor. They go great with a cup of coffee for a quick, light breakfast or an afternoon snack."
positive,19/10/20,I received a sample from Influenster and I have to say these are my new favorite breakfast bar. I LOVE banana nut bread and these have that same flavor. Great for on the go and they are healthy for you too. I keep one in my purse in case I ever need a quick snack. Definitely recommend these!
positive,1/3/20,"I recently tried the Quaker Banana Nut Bread cereal bar and was pleasantly surprised.  From first bite, I felt like I was really eating banana nut bread and it was simply delicious!"
positive,28/7/20,"Quaker Soft Baked Cereal Bar, Banana Nut Bread are great tasting and perfect for on the go!!  They are a great healthy snack and a better alternate instead of s candy bar or something high in sugars.  This a perfect snack for the whole family!!"
positive,7/3/20,"These Quaker Banana Bread bars are so tasty and I just love that they are low calorie, giving me a guilt free snack!"
positive,4/8/20,"I was a little wary trying these because I don't like dense, chewy bars that hurt your jaw to eat, and that's what I really thought this was going to be. I couldn't have been more wrong! I bit into it and got a crunch from the almonds on top and (I had to check the ingredients) soy crisps inside! I received one bar as a sample and went out and bought an entire box that same week! However, even though on the package it says that it tastes great heated up, I didn't like it. Heated up it lost the crunch and seemed to become that dreaded chewy bar. I still give this product 5 stars though because heating it up is definitely not something that you have to do!"
positive,26/12/19,"THIS BAR IS SOOOOO Good! it said to heat it up to taste better but i just ate it out of the pack. It was very filling for me. It does taste just like a banana nut muffin, this bar was moist and soft. My husband loved the bar as well. I would take this bar on the go or just have as a snack. It was filling with a cup of coffee, i will be purchasing more. yummy!"
positive,28/3/21,"I tried the banana nut bread soft baked cereal bar and it was so good! If you like banana flavored anything, you will love this. This is perfect for breakfast on the go for people like me who end up eating on their commute or for an afternoon snack. It's sweet enough to satisfy a sweet tooth, it reminds me of a healthier version of toaster strudel. The best part is that is contains protein, B vitamins and fiber. I can't wait to try the cinnamon pecan!"
positive,6/2/20,"I bought these as a way to supplement my meals, as well as get more fiber and protein.  First of all, these bars are fairly nutritious.  They are made of natural ingredients and whole grains, just like the cereal.  Each bar contains 6g of fiber and 9g of protein.  Considering most people in the United States don't get enough fiber, that is a very decent amount. Previously I was eating the Fiber One Bars Oats & Chocolate, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6).  While you get 3g more fiber in those bars, you only get 2g of Protein.  The Kashi bars are made of better (and more nutritious) ingredients, and they taste better as well.  Each bar has only 180 calories, but they are very filling due to the fiber and protein.<br /><br />Although a bar made of brown rice and oats doesn't sound very tasty, these are some of the best bars I've tried.  As the name implies, they're not chewy, but not too crunchy either.  Below is the main nutritional info:<br /><br />Calories  180<br />Total Fat  5g<br />  Sat fat  2g<br />Sodium  250mg<br />Carbs  30g<br />  FIBER  6g<br />PROTEIN  9g"
positive,25/4/21,"After doing some of research, both taste testing and strictly from a nutritional standpoint, these Kashi Golean bars in Chocolate/Caramel seemed to rise to the top of my list.  There were definitely some bars that offered more protein or fiber or even less calories or fat, but overall this seemed to be the best all around for me.  It comes in with 150 calories(less than most of competitors), 3 grams of fat(less than a lot of competitors), 8 grams of protein(more/on par with many of its competitors), and 6 grams of fiber(more than a lot of competitors). Oh yeah, and they taste pretty awesome as well."
positive,3/8/20,My husband worked for this Oreintal family who gave him a 48 oz package of  NOH Hawaiian Iced Tea . He raved on how good it was . I didnt believe him until I actually tried it . UMMMM great cool taste and refreshing Ice tea . I would definetely recommend
positive,15/4/19,"The aroma is just super, the flavor is great also. I'm using it to make iced tea, but I'm sure it's good hot also. Loved by everyone who has tried it.<br />Has a very mild lemon taste, well balanced flavor."
positive,9/3/18,Nice assortment.  One cheese got molded (before opening) about 10 days after arrival.  I GOURMET REPLACED IT PROMPTLY.  Nice grouping for a wine tasting party.
positive,18/5/18,"Don't be fooled buy the calorie count on this product, most people consider low calorie products to be less filling. I'm surprised at this tasty and filling meal in a can. I purchased this item on a whim, and glad that I did. Will purchase again for sure."
positive,9/3/18,"Quite flavorful, it jump starts my day! Certainly recommend it. I like a stout cup of coffee and would definately reorder it again!"
positive,27/2/18,"These are one of the best tasting potato chips that I have tasted. Nice and crunchy, a little thicker than other chips, and just the right amount of salt.<br /><br />While these are certainly not a health food, the current packaging boasts that they have 40% less fat than regular chips. The package also boasts ""no artificial flavors, no preservatives, no MSG, no trans fats, made with all-natural ptotatoes and seasonings."" One serving has: 6g fat, of which only 1g is saturated fat; 135mg sodium; 1g sugar, and 2g protein. For potato chips that is pretty good.<br /><br />Shop for price. The printed price on a 8.5 oz bag is $3.49, and I can get these for less on sale at my local supermarket."
positive,20/2/18,"Went to italy this past summer and again in september. So I became addicted to expresso, and ordered about 150 worth of pods when i got back.. and i really really enjoyed this one. My father and grandfather also like it (born and raised in italy). Will be ordering again."
positive,22/3/18,I just brewed my first cup and the aroma and flavor both speak of autumn and harvest.  I LOVE the flavor.  I would highly recommend this herbal tea.
negative,12/3/18,"I tasted wonderful cheese popcorn at the Palmer House in Chicago and thought this might be the same when sprinkled on hot buttered popcorn. Sorry I had to purchase six as I can't even give them away. Absolutely no taste whatsoever, even when you use a massive amount of it on popcorn. Don't waste your money."
positive,9/2/18,"I bought this brand without having tried it beforehand because I couldn't find any mulling spices in bags in the local grocery stores last month, and I was ready for some apple juice and mulling spices.  It tastes very good, much the same as another brand a friend shared with me last year.  I have tried other instant brands but didn't care for them.  These are perfect for me, although the amount I had to buy here on amazon was really more than what I wanted."
positive,7/12/17,"These are pretty good.  Some of the individually wrapped pieces must have tiny holes as some of the cookies are no longer crisp and fresh, but for the price, they are pretty great.  Most of them are good."
positive,24/5/19,These are very good crackers with a very italian cheesy taste. All 4 boxes had quite a few crushed at the bottom of the boxes/bags- bags inside the boxes. I liked them much better than just the regular cheddar ones.
positive,9/3/18,This is a very good rice and I will be ordering more.  Good flavor and it is always a surprise at a dinner party.
positive,18/5/18,"I don't eat chips often, but when I do, these are some of my favorites.  They have all the flavor and texture of traditional tortilla chips, but it is the subtle lime flavoring that makes them special.  The lime flavoring appears to be a seasoning that has been sprinkled on.  Some chips seem to have minimal flavor and I find myself looking for those with the most.  Still, none of them have quite enough for my tastes.  I wish that these chips had more than just a ""hint"" of lime."
positive,23/3/18,Crust is a little bland but the middle is great! I wish it were in stock more often.
positive,8/9/20,"These are the best quick-boil udons I've ever had. The noodles are<br />just right and the soup is pretty good. You can also skip the soup<br />base and add your own stuff. I like adding tofu and tempura fish balls with my udon. If you're fortunate enough to have a 99 Ranch Market or Nijiya Market nearby, save yourself some money and buy the udon there since they're sold for only 79 cents a pack."
positive,23/2/18,THIS IS AN AWESOME PRODUCT. DISSAPOINTED ONLY BY 4 CANS BEING DENTED. THEY WERE USABLE THOUGH. GREAT BUY COMPARED TO STORES!
positive,18/7/20,Best tasting green tea around a bit pricey . I tried yogi green tea because it was cheaper it was good but not a smooth and rich tasting.I will stick with Traditional Medicinal from now on.
positive,14/6/18,"taste like fruit. like the texture kinda like gummy bears.  love the calories, great snack and easy to travel with.<br />had these before and this is 2nd order"
positive,2/11/18,"I've wanted to find a stevia-sweetened soda for a long time, but I don't like typical colas or lemon-lime soft drinks.  I had hoped this would taste a little more like that other, well-known Dr. drink, but to be honest it just doesn't.  I guess my slight disappointment with that difference led me to knock off a star in my rating.  All in all however, it's a good flavor.  Bit of a cherry with a hint of citrus."
positive,14/10/18,"This is one of Zevia's more successful flavors.  It's more reminiscent of the flavor of Dr Pepper than a clone, but it still tastes very good.  I don't notice any kind of aftertaste.  I've bought this on its own before, and will again.  It's one of my favorite flavors."
positive,6/4/20,"My only complaint is that on the bottom of the package, the expiration date is 2001.  I don't think that's correct.  I made several cups of tea before I noticed it, and figured that since I hadn't had any adverse effects, either it was incorrect or it didn't matter.  It tastes refreshing and smells great! The combination of coconut and green tea is awesome!"
positive,9/3/18,"These are very good.  Not too sweet like most ""fig newton"" type bars and not gritty like some high fiber or high protein bars.  We eat them for afterschool snacks or breakfast on the run."
positive,18/5/18,"These candies are small which I like since I don't want to scarf down a candy bar that has 300 calories. These candies are about 15 calories each. The flavor is a mix between coffee and cream, which you already know, but the sugar content is not so large as to make you feel the candies are nothing but sugar. You can eat 8 of these candies a day and have no guilt. The hardness of the candies is great because they last awhile and unlike other candies they don't stick to your teeth and torture you for 20 minutes. Geeh, I'm sounding old! But I can't buy the junk from a vending machine at work and enjoy it and most candies are huge in size and calories, so these candies seem to be ideal."
positive,7/3/18,This is the only protein powder that I have used that tastes great even mixed with just cold water and a shaker.
positive,24/1/19,The product taste great for a Meal Replacement Powder. This works for me as I work and go to school fulltime and have less time cooking or preparing food. It satisfy my appetite for 2-3 hours.
positive,27/2/19,Love this stuff - 1st try used shaker cup to mix - would recommend using electric wand mixer to create milkshake effect - and the chocolately taste is yummy
positive,19/4/20,this is an ideal bar for someone that wants the taste of a nutty candybar but with 30grams of protein! Tastes like a Payday. High fat and sugar content are the downsides though.
positive,17/4/20,"Decided to try this out with no information on the product or past experience with the company because I'm familiar with powdered soup mix in general and if this one specifically tasted weird I could probably do something myself to make it better.<br /><br />The soup is good.  Four stars because the garlic and onion flavors are a bit strong.  If you are on a low sodium diet, you'll want to steer clear, because the sodium content is pretty high.  To be expected with a product like this, but you never can tell.<br /><br />Over all, I don't regret my purchase, and may even buy again in the future."
positive,3/4/20,"I love this stuff. I brew several pitchers of iced tea from it every day, and it has become my standard beverage. Now, I've had plenty of white teas from the various folks who mass produce them (like Lipton), but this is the first time I've bought it loose, and brewed it up myself, rather than pre-brewed or in tea bag form.<br /><br />So, point is, I'm an amateur. I don't have experience with other loose leaf white teas to compare. But I find this stuff divine. It's mild, yet tasty, and I don't ever get any caffeine effects that I notice. Now, if you need something to wake up in the morning, I could see that being a problem. But as something I drink all day long, I definitely don't want to have to worry about getting jittery or cutting myself off at a particular point in the evening. I've never had a hard time going to sleep after drinking this tea, and that's great in my book. There is some debate as to whether white tea has lower caffeine content than other teas (like black teas), but I can only go by personal experience. And, personally, I find that black teas like English Breakfast, when I brew them up, give me a very noticeable caffeine kick. This does not in any way.<br /><br />This tea seems great. I wish I had the expertise to know whether I'm enjoying something that really *is* awesome, or some shoddy imposter that, y'know, simply makes me very happy to drink but has no real quality to it. I suspect this is pretty decent quality, and I hope once the two pounds run out, to try some other brand (at least in a limited quantity) to see how they stack up to one another.<br /><br />Oh, and a side note -- turns out throwing out your first, brief steep will not make the rest caffeine-free. Read more here, if you're interested: [...]<br /><br />Also, one of my favorite aspects of this white tea (and I assume it's true of most white teas) is that there is almost *no* bitterness. Black tea isn't exactly like tonic water, but it does have a bit of a bitter taste, and I found that I really enjoyed it once that bitterness was gone. Even though I didn't know or think that black tea was unpleasantly bitter, I now notice it quite a bit. A case of one of those ""You don't know what you could've done without until it's gone"" sorts of things, I guess.<br /><br />Happy brewing!"
positive,7/8/19,"I love honey and I often buy expensive gourmet types. I decided to try this one because ""rain forest"" sounded unusual and also because it is labeled organic. This honey met my best expectations, it has very nice texture and aroma to it. For this price, I couldn't believe it, it does taste like a gourmet honey. I disagree with one of the previous comments. This honey's taste is NOT overbearing at all. Good quality honey should have a distinct flavor (that's what sets apart honeys coming from different areas and flower types) and that easily recognizable flavor is what is valued in each type of honey."
positive,9/3/18,"this is a good as it gets next to starbucks and since it is in your own home, it is even better!"
positive,18/5/18,"While the coffee is very tasty with lots of flavor I can't help being bothered by the high price. Everywhere: on line or in store. And the official site has it for 9.99/ box with 16 capsules of which 8 only is the coffee the rest is the milk. Well we need that too, still."
positive,27/1/19,"I love all the Dolce Gusto milky coffees, but this is my favorite.  Pricewise and tastewise, this beats the expensive coffee shops any day."
negative,10/11/19,"The coffee is great tasting but is expensive in my book. If Nestle hadn't sent me the machine for free I wouldn't have bought it. It leaks and is not a great machine for an office. Our office doesn't like it because you have to keep going to the bathroom to refill it with water because it only holds two cups worth of water. It does make a hot cup of coffee in a very quick time though."
positive,8/11/19,"For a great appetizer, stuff these little guys with goat cheese (or goat cheese mixed with cream cheese) and a little fresh basil.  Just put the cheese and basil in a plastic baggie, sqish to mix (add mild if too thick), cut a corner from the bag, and squeeze into the drained Peppadews.<br /><br />They'll be the hit of the dinner party.<br /><br />For style points, serve in a long skinny olive dish."
positive,25/10/21,These are fantastic. Better than regular pretzels. I was expecting them to be hard and grainy like everything else GF but they were not. They are made with potato and corn starch instead of rice flour. Seriously. These are really good!
positive,8/5/20,"This cheddar cheese tastes great.  It's not truly a sharp tangy taste but it is cheddar. The drawback is the shipping cost of nearly $20 for 2lbs eventhough it arrives virtually over night.  The nutrional label is as follows : ( for  a 1 & 1/4 size cube ) Calories 120, total fat 10g, saturated fat 6 grams, 0 trans fats, cholesterol 30mg, sodium 210, total carbs less than 1 g, protein 7 grams.<br />This cheese cannot be frozen as the label states.  It can be stored in the fridge up to one month but we consumed this in a week for a special party.  ( I included the nutritional content due to the marketplace did NOT state the facts when I bought this;  hopefully this helps other consumers )"
positive,28/9/18,"I love this stuff.  It's like the Sencha shot, but with a bit softer flavor profile.  Still fills in like an energy drink but without the weirdly contrived and overly sweet flavors of those drinks.  This stuff is also actually good for you."
positive,29/7/19,"Product tastes really good, just like regular pasta if you ask me. However, it does take twice as long to cook...which is fine by me if it has lower carbs."
positive,9/3/18,"Realllllly good!, I saw this reviewed on Seattle Coffee Gear's site and being me I thought oo I wonder if its on amazon! sure enough.. They had the whole bean version which I wanted more but but no grinder yet so I bought drip and since I hadn't tried it before I was wondering if it was really good or if it was just meh. This is awesome coffee, the drip grind is really great too and strong! I learned quick that you do not want to use too much now if your big on strong coffee go nuts, I used a cone type filter and used 2 1/2 tablespoons and I didn't really level off much and it was sooo strong but not bitter it was super smooth and it was chocolaty really good, love this coffee plan on buying more :0) if you can't find it on here just go to their website."
positive,18/5/18,"This is a very tasty, powdered instant decaf chai tea mix. It blends easily and well and tastes delicious. i like to take a few packets when I travel"
positive,17/5/20,"As other reviewers have noted already, this seems to be Kellogg's attempt to replicate Honey Nut Cheerios, at least in appearance.  Nutritionally the two are also very similar.  Crunchy Nut tastes sweeter and I found myself eating it as a snack.  I can't say the taste is too similar to HNC so just because you like one doesn't mean you'll necessarily like the other.  Overall it's definitely to my liking and I can see myself buying both Crunchy Nut and HNC."
positive,26/3/20,"We cannot believe how flavorful this Kraft Thick and Spicy Brown Sugar Barbecue Sauce tastes.  I used this to cook some very meaty chicken breast and the flavors popped!  It's not too spicy for us and I assume it's because of the brown sugar.  You can't go wrong with buying a product from Kraft Foods."
positive,24/2/20,I started drinking this tea about 1-1/2 weeks ago and have seen my acne slowly fade away.  My co-workers even mentioned how bright my complexion was looking.
positive,3/5/19,All the cures work and taste great. I like hickory smoked/flavored items so this was great for me. Great seasoning.
positive,27/3/20,"Absolutely the best Nutella alternative. I actually prefer it over nutella, it tastes so rich and just plain phenomenal! A bit more hazelnutty than Nutella, gah just great!"
positive,31/12/20,"Great size to try out Xylitol before making a larger commitment.  I like that it is Birch and not Corn, and made in USA.  You should be aware that Xylitol has a spearmint type sweetness to it. It may alter the taste of some foods because of this trait. I use it in my coffee as a substitute for regular sugar and I am completely satisfied.  You need to add slightly more to get the same level of sweetness, but its close."
positive,13/1/20,"These bars (all of the roll types) are hard to eat. That's actually part of why I like them so much. Because they take some effort to bite into and chew, they basically force you to eat slower. As a result, you feel more satisfied at the end of eating one than if you had scarfed down a candy bar in three bites. I don't find them hard as rocks though, just very chewy. If you don't like chewy food, then these are definitely not for you. I also really like the texture contrast between the crunchy/crispy outside and the chewy nougat inside of the bar.<br /><br />There is a bit of a mess factor involved in eating these, as noted by one reviewer. The caramel is sticky and sometimes leaves traces on the wrapper, and the outside crispy/crunchy coating tends to crumble off a bit. If you want to keep the inside of your car spotlessly clean, you might not want to chow down on a Go-Lean roll bar while driving. Nevertheless, I still think these are some of the best bars out there. They are not discernibly chalky nor do they have a strange chemical aftertaste the way that many protein or energy bars do. They really are like fortified candy bars. And they pack quite a high protein and fiber punch for only 190 calories each, while only having about 13 mg of sugars--about 1 Tablespoon--per bar (I was expecting more like 25-30 mg when I tried my first one). The chocolate turtle roll is my favorite flavor, but honestly, I've tried every single flavor of the Go-Lean Roll bars, and they are really all quite good."
positive,21/9/20,"I've been receiving this product via auto-delivery for about a year now.  I try to eat one of these bars as my lunch at least 3 days a week.  It tastes like a candy bar and provides enough fiber, protein, etc. to replace a meal.  I think it's a great way to help me lose weight."
positive,2/12/20,"My wife and I are senior citizens on a fixed income, though not as fixed as it was six months ago. If you are like us and looking for a reasonably priced and tasty source of protein in a well-rounded package with other vital nutrients, look no further! This stuff is delicious. Don't be surprised when unsuspecting dinner guests ask for the recipe. We just reply that it's a family secret. The only con I can think of is having to choose between the beef, the lamb, and the turkey. But why choose? Just buy all three."
positive,20/11/19,"This dressing is awesome! It's very tasty and not so full of chemical ingredients as other dressings. We wish we would have discovered it earlier."
positive,2/12/20,I love the taste of this green tea. It has a natural sweet mango taste and not the bitterness of plain green tea. I use 5 bags to make a pot.  Great tasting and good for you!
positive,11/12/19,"I love to eat it as a snack while reading; before I know it, the jar is empty.  But I buy it from Plum Market online for $5."
positive,20/11/19,"As a big fan of Arnold Palmers, half lemonade half iced tea over ice, I'm pleased with this K-Cup variety.  I add a bit of sugar after brewing it over a big cup filled with ice, and its a great alternative to soda or trying to mix an Arnold Palmer myself at home."
negative,28/6/20,"Thought it tastes funny.  Not like iced tea, not like lemonade and no where in between.  There are much better flavors out there"
positive,8/8/20,"I just ordered these vanilla caramels, along with a bag of the sea salt kind.  Although I am more partial to the sea salt AvenueSweets caramels, these are also great - very fresh, soft and chewy, with a hint of vanilla."
positive,14/7/21,"I can't get decaf at the stores here and love this tea.  I am now well supplied and can share a box or 2 with friends.  You can make it with just water or for a special treat use 1/2 milk.  Add some honey and top with whipped cream - very decadent!  The price is very good and I got free shipping."
positive,2/12/20,"This is some of the smoothest coffee I've ever tasted. For people who don't really like the taste of coffee I'd highly recommend this coffee. It doesn't have any bitter aftertaste. It really is incredibly smooth!"
positive,20/11/19,"I tried Congo Bongo in my friend's house, and absolutely love it. But since I prefer green tea, I've ordered Fiji. It has great taste, hope the quality of the tea also good. Love Fiji, and going to try some other flavor from SerendipiTea."
positive,1/3/21,"I bought these in response to a 'Just For You!' recommendation and was very pleased.  The product was fresh and gummy, not stale at all.  I was surprised at how brightly colored these bears are.  I admire their tasty, tasty glow just before I pop them into my mouth.<br /><br />I was home when the box arrived and, since it was a warm day, I was glad I was.  The bears were crammed together at one end of the packaging and very warm, so I popped the unopened bag into the fridge for a while.  When they had cooled, I opened the bag -- it's not a resealable bag -- and divided the bears into 5 ziplocs, eating the ones that fell onto the counter for, ummmm, health and safety reasons.  Hopefully, this will keep them fresh a long while."
positive,5/5/21,"This is the only food I have been feeding my dog since I took him off puppy chow.  He loves it.  His coat is soft and shiny and I haven't had any health problems.  He is a 3.5 year old mini dachshund so this small breed formula works well for him."
positive,2/12/20,"I can't believe how great this water is. I got the Apple Pear flavored water and am really into it. I put a couple into the freezer and get them super cold - and then take them with me for the day.<br /><br />I also really love the way the bottle fits into a back pocket - let's me be hands free :-)"
negative,20/11/19,"I didn't like the taste of this very much.  It was OK, but it tasted a little odd.  I loved their White Lightening Chicken Chili, but don't recommended the Chicken Noodle Soup."
positive,9/10/21,"Ultra light weight and real live fruit, a great combination. The fruit is freeze dried, for those of you that remember space ice cream, it is the same idea. The fruit is sliced and placed in a machine that freezes the fruit and then a vacuum pulls off the water. The process retains a lot of the original flavor and preserves the fruit for almost eternity (well about two years expiration date on the pouches) without using any chemicals.<br /><br />The taste is really nice. These are all crisp fruit pieces, not the gummy fruit leather food. Banana / Strawberry is probably the tastiest and most fragile. The strawberry flavor is strong and the bananas are subtle without picking up the strawberry flavor. Apples come in a nice second. The pieces are thick and about two inches in diameter. The pears are good, maybe a touch tart and have the same texture as the apples.<br /><br />The fruit is completely dry and absorbs water in your mouth very quickly. If you eat it too fast, the strawberries coat your teeth a little bit. The others are very clean to eat.<br /><br />I like these packages in my carryon bag for plane trips. They make a great emergency snack, take up little space, and weigh nothing. Number two son packs these in his lunch almost every day now. He likes the strawberry banana the best. I really like all three flavors.<br /><br />The pouches list that they are a product of China. I list that as information so you can be aware of where this fruit comes from, and make no value judgment for you. The manufacturing process has been around for a very long time. It is a very safe process, and as long as the fruit going in is good, the food should be good. So far every pouch has been consistently good.<br /><br />I like these a lot. They make a great snack."
positive,6/3/21,The dried fruit are very tasty. The individual pkgs are handy and convenient. Great for people on the go. I recommend this product.
positive,12/2/21,"Whoa.....a really nice sweetness!  It is softer than the raw, organic cane sugar I am presently using and it has no aftertaste. I never could get used to Stevia in my coffee but this is delicious!  Just a very good product."
positive,2/12/20,"This is a staple item at our house.  I use it in soups, barbecue, meatloaf, and anything else that we want to spice up.  Pure tasting w/o any other spices overpowering the flavor.  You ""apply"" as much heat as you desire and still maintain the integrity of your recipe.  The 2 small jars were timely and intact when delivered."
positive,20/11/19,"I've tried many pancake batters and this one is up there, as one of the best. Great flavor. The texture is a little fluffy and ""stretchy"", but maybe because I added an extra egg. The batter needs a lower cooking temperature though, otherwise it burns rather easily. Easy to work with though! And best of all, NO SUGAR, only granulated honey."
positive,25/6/21,These are fantastic! They are a good price for what you get. I made sugar cookies and the kids drew on them.
positive,17/3/20,"The taste of Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee is so wonderful.  As soon as it begins to brew, you can smell it throughout the kitchen.  The taste is deep, rich, and sweet!"
positive,20/10/21,"Gloia Jeans Butter Toffee coffee has a great taste. The smell of the aroma as the coffee brews starts an enjoyable experience. Sit back, relax and enjoy a cup!"
positive,21/7/20,"This is a very tasty tea. I served it at a bridal shower and it was one of the favorites. My husband loved it and took the remaining tea bags to work. We'll be ordering more!"
positive,22/2/21,"My grandson loves the strawberry Kellogg's Special K Bars but the strawberry flavored are sometimes difficult to find in the grocery store.  I was thrilled to find them on amazon and be able to buy them by the case on a regular basis.  Heaven forbid that Nana be caught without a strawberry breakfast bar at all times!"
positive,8/6/21,"My first time eating Kelp Noodles. They taste great. Now I just need to find them locally so that i will not have to place an order for food. Nevertheless, recommend this company and their Kelp."
positive,2/12/20,"This is by far the best Teriyaki Jerky I have tasted. It is a thick cut, salty, sweet and tender. The price is the only thing that is no good. I would buy more if it was bulk or reasonable but this seems to be the only place to purchase. I am a repeat customer and will continue. Thanks!!"
negative,20/11/19,like eating soft plastic . we pored them in a big pile in the back yard under the trees. the squeals wont eat them!
positive,25/1/21,"I have been a marzipan fanatic for over 55 years. While there are finer and fancier marzipans, in my opinion, for the money, this is a very nice, dependable product. I buy a 5 pound wedge every year, and make candy gifts for family and friends, and always get compliments and cheers. If you are a serious gourmet, you might not care for it, but for most people, for general use, it is quite nice."
positive,1/7/21,"Only 90 calories and no trans or saturated fat. I love these things, but I can't eat just one so watch out."
positive,30/9/20,I was following a diet where no sugar was allowed.  I tried this product and it has a good taste with out sugar.  I also used to put some other mint flavor herb tea mixed with this to get my own flavor.  Worth trying.
negative,15/3/20,"well, do you know how difficult it is to find WHITE RICE PUFFED RICE?<br /><br />Only company that does it is QUAKER.<br /><br />Millet doesn't cut it. sorry. won't but it again.<br /><br />Have tried all the puffed rice products. Most don't tell you that these puffed rice products are BROWN RICE PUFFED RICE.. Truth in advertising?<br /><br />I think not.<br /><br />BROWN RICE PUFFED just doesn't have the taste of WHITE RICE PUFFED.<br /><br />I can still find it at ALBERTSONS at around $4 bucks a box."
positive,6/7/21,I ordered this for my diabetic daughter.  I found some not so great reviews from people  so I only ordered one bottle.  My whole family loves this stuff!!!  I even like it and I am not a sno-cone fan.  It has an excellent flavor!  The syrup is light and doesnt overtake the ice.  I will order all of my syrups from Back to Basics sugar free collection from now on.  I highly reccoment this product!!!!
positive,29/6/21,"I add this to my kids milk for added protein and calcium.  It clumps together so you have to mix it up in a blender, but it tastes great and is worth the price to avoid hormones in non-organic milk.  It is hard to find around here, and I'm glad Amazon carries it.  They offer it cheaper than special ordering it from the health food store.<br /><br />I add it to homemade icing and ice cream too!"
positive,29/6/21,"Great seller, a great customer service ,outstanding value & good tasting Italian coffee I will be back after I drink all of my coffee that I purchased to purchase another back from the seller I have advise you people to do the same."
positive,26/7/21,"These are awesome! Our Golden/Lab loves them and eats one daily. They DEFINITELY make his breath smell better, which is why we got them in the first place. Great product. Not smelly to humans, don't make a mess when eating."
positive,21/10/21,"I've never had Mallomars before.  I live in Wisconsin, and do not know if they make it all the way over here.  The only time I ever remember hearing the name before is in the Simpsons episode ""Hurricane Neddy"" when nice-guy Flanders finally snaps and cusses out the whole town.  Upon getting to the portly Police Chief Wiggum he says, ""The only case you've gotten to the bottom of was a CASE OF MALLOMARS!!!""<br /><br />I assume by what I've read that they are a fall only type product, like the McRib.  I am also informed by the box that they are a New York kinda thing.<br /><br />Regardless, I'm glad Vine gave me the chance to try them, because they are SO GOOD!!!<br /><br />The crunchy dark chocolate coating over a marshmallow lump and thin crunchy cookie gives a s'mores like experience that truly satisfies.<br /><br />An excellent snack.  Buy a box today."
positive,25/10/21,"I was told about this stuff at a party and, as a lover of Mayonnaise, thought I'd buy some. I don't use it a lot, but it's pretty good on fries. I imagine it will make a great tunafish sandwich too. If you've never had it before, it tastes a lot like traditional Mayo but considerably more vinegar-y. Some people who don't like Mayo have told me they like this."
positive,29/6/21,"I discovered these at my local Trader Joe's but then they stopped carrying them.  I hunted and located them under their original 'colors'.  They make a very tasty vegetable broth - carrot and onion flavors are not too strong as in some other broths."
positive,5/7/21,"I enjoy bloodymary's but at times making a mix from scratch is too timely so I settle for something different.  I've tried several other Bloody mixes with poor results.  The Zing Zang Bloody Mix is the closest I've come to homemade.  It's extremely tasty!  No more skipping an urge for a bloody when this mix is at hand. Highly recommend"
positive,17/9/21,This is the easiest and tastiest applesauce cake with out the hassle .  Everyone will think you made it fromscratch.
positive,18/8/21,"This is a great Chai Tea.  It's very aromatic and flavorful but not overpowering strong like some can be."
positive,31/7/21,"This sauce, with lobster added, was the hit of the night! Paired with pasta and garlic bread, my family couldn't stop raving about it.  I managed to save one jar for myself."
positive,18/10/21,"Despite the poor review below, this instant Udon Bowl is suprisingly delicious.  This instant udon bowl is so delicious, most people can't tell the difference between Udon served at a restaurant, and the Udon from this bowl.  I love adding an egg to my meal with this udon, I just plop it in there, with bowling water, and boom.  Fresh Udon with egg.  Can't be beat. Enjoy!"
positive,29/6/21,"I used to be able to buy this in the grocery stores but no longer.  I don't know why since it's the best pepper out there for cooking and flavoring.  It's easy to use (grind is just right) and more flavorful than bland black pepper.  I use it in salads and whenever I am adding pepper to a recipe."
positive,16/9/21,"It's hard to rate and review a Cheez-It.  If you like the white cheddar or monterey jack kind, then you'll like this one too.  These are just a little bit milder."
positive,24/8/21,"The new Cheez-It Mozzarella flavored crackers are great tasting. The crunch was transformed into a creamy cheese flavor as I greedily shoveled them into my mouth. I had to shovel them, because the crackers were broken into crumbs when I received them. This however in no way detracted from the flavor or deterred me from the swift completion of my appointed task. Wait, I think I missed one. Mmmmm"
positive,24/6/21,I came home from a hot morning in the Arizona sun and opened my illy issimo coffee drink nice and cold from the fridge. I found the expresso taste strong but refreshing and the amount of sweetness just right. Great Product.
positive,27/9/21,"Very deep and tasty Caffe drink. It's got just a hint of sweetness and a hint of chocolate taste. Not too much fat and less sugar than most drinks of this type. Even my husband who doesn't like coffee likes it. It reminds me of a Starbucks double shot, but less sweet and it has less cream. I'd definitely buy these and try them again."
positive,29/6/21,"switched to this melitta lite coffee from dunkin' donuts coffee.  delicious, flavorful, smooth brew without leaving jangly coffee nerves or early morning digestive difficulties.  the low acid and reduced caffeine really help.  highly recommend!"
negative,5/8/21,"Very little taste (weak) and no caffiene that I can tell. I even emailed Tao of Tea about brewing suggestions, and got no reply."
positive,29/6/21,"My 3-year old has been eating this soup since she was about 1 year old.  She absolutely loves it, and so do I. It's organic and very healthy (with lower sodium than just about any other canned soup on the market)."
positive,31/7/21,Great way for kids to get in their fruits and veggies. I add to yogurt & smoothies.
positive,11/9/21,"My husband and I love to cook.  Jarred sun-dried tomatoes available in our area grocery stores have been a disappointment.  Not these! Flavorful and easy to use in a variety of dishes.  The flavor is a burst of summer sweetness. Often, these are eaten as ""chef's treats"" during cooking.  Price is more than fair.  I will keep  these on hand always."
positive,12/8/21,This tea is very flavorful. The pyramidal tea bags seem to allow more flavor to infuse. I would buy this again.
positive,31/7/20,"I love this balsamic vinager. it has a great flavor, on par with some of the more expensive ones i have tried."
positive,13/6/20,"Not to sweet, not too bitter. The blueberry is not overbearing, but yet you know it's there.  Overall, I like it."
positive,31/7/20,"I like cashews any way, so I'm biased.  I really enjoyed these.  They do earn the name of salty, though.  So this product is not for those that need to eat low sodium, but for the rest of us they will be a tasty treat."
positive,13/6/20,"I was pleasantly surprised by this product. I like salt and pepper flavors in general, but this one has a bit garlic and onion flavor to it that I liked a lot.<br /><br />The pepper isn't too hot, but it gives it a nice kick. The pepper flavor doesn't compare with freshly ground pepper, naturally, but it's pretty good for a commercially made product.<br /><br />It's a tiny bit too salty for my taste, but I know that tends to be personal preference that's different for everybody.<br /><br />The nuts are well roasted and crunchy. They're also a really nice size--too often I see tiny nuts that don't have much flavor. These nuts are tasty.<br /><br />I would get these again. These would be an interesting snack to serve to guests."
positive,26/9/20,"I've been partial to Emerald's products so my favorable reaction to this one comes as no surprise to me.  However, I would warn that this may not be to everyone's taste - at least at first.  The sea salt definitely has more kick than the usual salted nuts and the pepper gives it a decided bite.  For those whose taste in nuts tend more towards sweeter concoctions, this may be a bit much.  But for those who like dark beer, strong coffee, and snacks with attitude, this is a welcome treat."
positive,17/10/20,"First of all, I'm a cashew lover, so I figured I'd like these nuts. What I didn't expect was how much I'd like the sea-salt pepper combo. There's a slight 'twang' after eating a handful of these, and they are great with a cold beer or soda. Each nut is big and bold, no little pieces in this jar. The packaging is great; good for taking along on trips. The twist lid is easy on and off. If you enjoy spice, go for these, the pepper does give a little extra kick."
positive,14/12/20,"I ordered this from another website and my newly diagnosed to need to be Gluten Free 16 year old son LOVED it. When returning to the other site to no longer find it there, I returned to my old friend Amazon.com. I am impressed with all the GF products that I can get on here....and even more excited that I can use the Subscribe and Save option to have a continuous supply of mac n cheese always in our house. Thanks."
positive,29/5/20,"Just tried my first cup and it's as good as the restaurant stuff I typically pay a premium for ($3 for 8-12oz with ice). I'm loving it!<br /><br />Update: I tried the Pantainorasingh brand, which is not nearly as good as this brand. Sadly, I may end up throwing away the other brand even though I hate to be wasteful. The taste is very different."
positive,9/12/20,"This tea is very tasty. It doesn't have the unappealing fresh paint smell that some other Thai tea mixes have. I'm very pleased with it. I agree with the other reviewer that the price is high for shipping. In my area I could not find it in the Asian stores so I have to order it. For three bags the shipping was just $1.50 more than the shipping for one bag so I bought three to offset the shipping cost. I also agree with one of the other reviewers that the tea should be brewed very strongly then add water or milk to it later. I love the tea hot or cold with or without cream. The lovely orange color shows up better when you use cream or milk and the color is part of the charm of the drink."
positive,4/8/20,"I don't know if this product tastes exactly like the thai tea in the restaurants, nor do I know if I'm brewing the tea exactly the way they do. But, it tastes very good, and I look forward to drinking it. It's a personal treat. It is best served with regular half and half. Not milk or fat free half and half. I brew it using my coffee maker. I put the filter paper, just as if I were about to brew some coffee. I use my judgement with the amount of tea to water ratio. And i can now visualize the amount I need for a specific strength. All in all, it's a good product. Only had a problem with the shipping. I live in NYC. And will perhaps search for this product in China town next time. But until then, I have two bags to keep me busy."
negative,31/7/20,"It is not worth the money.It does have a terrible taste.I bought one so far and stopped buying it and threw the unused coffee in garbage. If you want a good tasting instant coffee try Nescafe Classic or Nescafe Gold, available everywhere on earth but parts of the US."
positive,13/6/20,"I have a puppy that absolutely loves them! She considers them her personal ""reward"" for everything she does. A good training aid."
positive,21/11/20,"I am more concerned with sugar than fat. And this is a great sugar free item, best tasting creamer without sugar, not too sweet, just perfect."
positive,25/5/21,"I've been searching for a good-tasting protein drink since I had a gastric bypass 3 years ago. I saw this product on another weight loss surgery blog and decided to give it a try. You can drink it warm (unlike most other protein drinks) or cold and it mixes quite easily if you use a container with a blender ball. I thought it was a bit too thick when I mixed it according to the directions (2 scoops in 12-14 oz. of water) so the next time I used more water. Others might prefer the thicker version, though. I also added crushed ice after I mixed it which kept it cold longer and made it more like an iced coffee drink. When I travel, I take my empty blender ball container in my carryon bag, stuffed with ziploc bags filled with protein shake powders but on my next trip will be taking these packets instead."
positive,25/5/21,"I was just introduced to these olives on a United flight this week. Probably the best tasting green olives I have ever had (I usually never eat green olives). I was so happy with them I purchased two snack pack boxes with the Olove packs on my return flight to share with my wife and kids. I'm thrilled I am able to purchase these on amazon and really suggest them to anyone looking for a great snack."
positive,20/1/21,"I used this in cakes, cup cakes and candies, its great in drinks i found as well as long as your making mixed drinks. I really enjoyed this produce and i urge people to try this and experiment with it, be adventurous with your cooking and the flavors you use its truly worth it!"
negative,15/1/21,Tasted bland - did not have the freshness and aroma of sping onions - Would not buy again
positive,8/2/21,"My dog loves them, loves them, loves them. I find them a bit pungent, they are fish after all but my opinion isn't the one that counts."
positive,10/2/21,"We picked some of these up this week. They're very convenient and quite handy to have around just to grab when you're walking out the door. The taste is about what you'd expect from Hershey's chocolate milk, it's chocolate, it's sweet, and it's really good. It's nice that they don't need to be refrigerated either, at least until after they are opened.<br /><br />On the one hand these are better for a child than cola, but on the other hand there's still a lot of sugar in them and 200 calories in only 8 oz. I'm looking at the servings right now and for one container it has 29 g of sugar. I'll grant you it's not empty calories because there's 30% of the daily intake of calcium, but still if you can train the kid to drink skim milk that's fewer calories for them.<br /><br />When I was a kid my parents used to give me skim milk with not much chocolate powder in it. My real treat was the 2% chocolate milk at school, but it was fairly rare to get it; they'd have chocolate milk maybe once a week. These things probably aren't all that bad by comparison to some of the junk food kids eat. I just feel a little wary if feeding them lunch for lunch because the calories do add up.<br /><br />I'd never tell anybody how to raise their kids (or what to drink themselves), but I for one plan to have these as a treat every now and then instead of as a regular part of my diet. Anyway, they are tasty and I'd recommend."
positive,9/10/20,"My wife doesn't like chocolate, but she likes granola. I love chocolate and I'm fine with granola. Here's a granola snack we can agree on. She tasted it and pronounced it ""pretty good."" I'm a big fan of chocolate bars with add-ins, like bacon or fruit or chili, so chocolate with berries is right up my alley. I like it, and I don't have to feel guilty when I eat it. Now if I can just get our 5-year-old to try some, I can share the whole family's opinion."
positive,31/7/20,"I'm always looking for healthy snack alternatives. But healthy snacks are not always very tasty. This one was. It has a good crunch factor and the chocolate and berry flavors stood out without being overpowering.  My two teen aged sons fought over the bag. One enjoyed is as a cereal, the other just as a snack.  I, myself enjoyed it sprinkled over some fat-free frozen yogurt. The serving size (1/4 cup) is a little small. It would be easy to eat the whole bag without even realizing it. But it's perfect as a topping for yogurt or ice cream. My boys have asked me to add this to my regular shopping list."
positive,13/6/20,I bought this product as a gift for my son who is away at college. He liked the tea and enjoyed having a varity to pick from. I will re-order this again. Two thumbs up!
positive,5/12/20,"This mix is exactly as advertised . I Decided to add chopped onion ,sesame seeds and a small amount of Chile paste and  the results were outstanding . I also used .75 lbs of Ahi instead of the full LB. and it worked fine .I would buy this product again ."
positive,1/11/20,Without my miracle noodles I would go crazy.  My cravings pasta are under control with Miracle Noodles!!  They are delicious with any sauce or olive oil.
negative,14/1/21,"Honestly.............I used to buy this frequently before they stopped caring it in my grocery store.  So I was actually quite excited to see its availibility online!  I'm not exactly sure what's up with it, but it has absolutely NO taste whatsoever......very big disappointment :o("
positive,6/6/21,"This is a chocolate donut flavored coffee. It is not pre sweetened, has a great aroma and flavor. It is perfect for someone who likes it dark or likes to add cream and or sugar on his or her own. I have tried other flavors like this and this one is by far the best."
positive,21/7/20,We love K-cups and the ease of using them. The donut house collection (chocolate glazed donut) is great tasting! I would highly recommend these K-cups
positive,5/1/21,"This coffee is excellent. It's a lighter blend so those who prefer chewable coffee may not like it. It has an amazing scent of a chocolate donut. I'm new to the K Cup, but so far, this is one of my favorite flavors."
positive,23/1/21,I got a really good deal of this item in amazon.<br />Amazon provides must cheaper price than local stores.<br />The noodle includes two separate soup powders that make the taste so amazing.
positive,31/7/20,"fairly easy to cook, a little nutty  in (taste )for some ."
positive,13/6/20,"These flakes are smaller than I expected for something called ""large,"" but they taste great straight out of the package.  Throw them in your hot or cold cereal, on top of ice cream, or mix them into yogurt.  They're a sweet, crunchy, healthy treat!"
positive,1/12/20,This was good honey in a nice package. I used it as a compliment for the beer I made called Honey Britches. I taped the sticks to the side of the bottles and it added a nice little sweetness to the beer that already used orange honey in the brew process. Honey ferments completely so there was very little residual sugar left which this item helped remedy.
positive,30/1/21,This is my favorite snack bar. The price is about the same as the sale prices I find at the supermarket on a per unit basis.
positive,1/1/21,"At 80 cents a piece these are a good deal. They contain all natural ingredients which sounds like something for a tree hugger which I'm not; it actually makes them good and not disgusting like some other granola type bars. I'm torn between the apple pie ones and these which are both the same price. One of each makes a good cheap lunch @ $1.60."
positive,11/1/21,"The Cinnamon Roll flavors are not quite as good as the other Larabars.  There is just not enough cinnamon for my tastes.  However, they are still very tasty!"
positive,31/7/20,"Several people have written in to say that their Larabars were old and crumbly.  I just received a box of 16 Chocolate Coconut Chew Larabars and they are in date, moist, have a good consistency, and are delicious.  This is a perfect mid-morning or after workout snack.  I love that they are raw, vegan, Kosher, contain all-natural ingredients and have no processed sugar.  These taste better, are healthier, and have a better texture than most lines of exercise-oriented energy bars."
positive,13/6/20,"Best Energy bar ever...healthy, tasty, & less than 4 ingredients.  What could be better than that.  Great taste too."
positive,14/1/21,"I am a marathon runner and diabetic.  I have spent years tinkering with different energy/meal bars and eventually settled with ClifBar--which is not bad, though it has many sugary ingredients like rice syrup, etc.  I was extremely excited to discover LaraBar, it is delicious, contains no added sugars and provides an excellent source of energy for training.  Definitely the best bar on the market!"
positive,7/12/20,"This bar is good. It tastes like eating a banana mixed in with some nuts. I like that it doesn't have any sugar added and it just uses the natural sugars from the banana to flavor the bar."
positive,5/5/21,I was so hoping that Starbucks would come out with a mild blend for k cups. Starbucks has exceeded my hopes. This coffee is delicious. THANKS STARBUCKS
positive,23/11/20,"Great to have a sugar that tastes great, cooks with everything, and has not yet been cooped by the GMO crowd of producers.  We'll order again, and enjoyed the speedy delivery.  We wish this came in larger bags, for truly bulk orders.  25 lbs bags would be great."
positive,29/8/20,"Not my favorite, but for the price great product and It's handy, stores well and works well in coffee and other foods. I have added distilled water and used in my cereal. Straight is fine, but I am calorie conscious, so I prefer to add a little water. Organic Valley is the best, but for obvious reasons it cost more."
positive,18/1/21,"My 7 year old really likes them. They are worth the price, good packing and fresh to taste. I highly recommend this product."
positive,18/6/21,I have never used Gluten free pasta before. I absolutely love this pasta. I enjoy eating spaghetti once in a while and this satisfies that craving. It is very important to make sure the water is boiling prior to putting in the pasta. I say this because my daughter decided to make spaghetti for herself and added pasta in pan of water before it was boiling. Well what happened was a glob of gooey mess. Lesson learned.
positive,18/6/21,"I made this purchase for a visiting relative and although I did not drink it, she enjoyed the tea very much and ordered her own when she returned home."
positive,7/7/21,I received this product as part of the Amazon Vine Program<br /><br />This Lipton to go decard tea is good and is refreshing.<br /><br />I wished it had less ingredients but overall is a better<br />alternative to soda pop. And less calories.
positive,18/6/21,"I really liked the taste of this. I mixed it with 16.9 water bottles, cold from the refrigerator. I found it took quite a bit of shaking to mix the powder in, and never did get it completely dissolved as there were still tiny bits that settled to the bottom. I think if you drink some from the bottle before adding the drink mix, it would allow more room for mixing in the bottle.<br />The strawberry taste was excellent, not too sweet and no strange aftertaste. I really like that it is low calorie without artificial sweetner. It makes drinking my daily intake of water easier.<br />The packets are small enough to tuck in a pocket for use on the go. The package has a notch to make opening easier. I will definitely buy these. I would have given five starsnif it was easier to dissolve."
positive,7/7/21,"This product has great taste, and not too sweet. The tea mixes up in your water like coolaide, and comes in individual packets so you can take it along with you. However, the packets do not tear by hand, but you must use a knife or scissors to get them open. That is the only thing that needs to be improved."
positive,1/7/21,"This tastes like a tropical cocktail... all it needs is the alcohol (didn't try adding that).  The mango flavor is pungent and if you like that flavor, you will like this tea.  Very enjoyable taste."
positive,7/7/21,"When I try a powdered drink mix, I am interested in three factors: First, I want the stuff to taste good.  Second, I want it to dissolve well.  Third, I'd rather drink something without a lot of calories.  This drink satisfied all three conditions for me, so I would be interested in buying more in the future.<br /><br />The drink tastes good.  It's a little sweet for one packet mixed into a drinking glass, but there are enough fruit flavors to make the sweetness a bit complex and worth tasting.  I didn't taste the pineapple at all, but the mango flavor was nice and pronounced, not quite overwhelmed by the honey taste.  It doesn't taste like home-brewed iced tea, but it was closer than I expected from a powdered mix.<br /><br />The box warns that the powder needs some extra mixing to fully dissolve, but I had no problem at all stirring it in a glass for a couple of seconds.  There was no grainy layer at the bottom of the glass, and my drink was smooth.<br /><br />Finally, each packet is only ten calories, so this still counts as a viable low-calorie alternative to soft drinks.  There are lower calorie sweeteners out there, but ten is close enough to zero that this mix is a viable beverage for those who prefer to drink water most of the time.<br /><br />This is not a must-drink experience, but it's very good by powdered drink mix standards, and I recommend it."
positive,23/7/21,"This has lots of flavor and is great that it is decaf.  i don't like drinking caffeine throughout the day.  I would recommend this as it's easy to carry with you in your purse, briefcase, or tote bag and it adds a lot of flavor to your water.  It only adds 5 calories though.  Great stuff."
positive,20/7/21,"Normally I just don't like powdered drink mixes but these are really good! The package says that half a packet is for 16 ounces of water and has two servings per packet.<br /><br />I used them in 32oz of water the first time however, it was sweet enough that I cut back to a little more than half a packet for 32oz and it still had a nice sweetness.<br /><br />It's a great product and I would purchase it without any reservation."
positive,19/7/21,"I often buy products like this to use when traveling, because it is cheaper to buy a case of water and use a drink mix than to buy sodas and drinks on the road.  This tasted like fresh-brewed tea and disolved completely.  I wasn't stuck with a residue on the bottom.  Just the right sweetness level and a tasty mix of strawberry flavor."
positive,18/6/21,"I was surprised at how good this tasted.  It's sweet and you can really taste the pineapple.  It also has only 10 calories per 16oz serving (better than soda) and it mixes well in water.  The tea also doesn't have that strong instant tea after taste.<br /><br />I would definately, buy this again."
positive,7/7/21,"This has a great flavor.  If you are concerned about what you give your kids and don't like all the extras that are put into kids foods, you'll love this. I have been looking for these for a while. My kids love the flavor of these in their lunchbox, and I do too!<br />They taste fine with no extra junk in them."
positive,27/6/21,"The packaging makes this great on the go. The applesauce is tasty - I think it's green apples, so it has a little green apple taste but not sour. Kids like it and like the squeezy action involved. The amount is great for a quick snack. It would be easy to use while walking/runny/biking as an alternative to the energy shot/gel things that some people like to use."
positive,21/7/21,Taste is much better than competing brands and has a good shelf life.  Subscribe and save lets you be sure to always have the right amount on hand at the best price.
positive,18/6/21,We have been getting these Crisps for some time now and we love them. I also ordered some for my granddaughter they make a great healthy treat for her and she loves them too.
positive,7/7/21,"It tastes great, dissolves just fine, and provides the jolt I need to start my day."
positive,30/6/21,"When I was a kid, Post used to make a cereal called C. W. Post. It was a granola type cereal that was the absolute best. It disappeared from the grocery shelves sometime in the 1980's.<br /><br />Fast forward to today. Walking down the grocery isle, I noticed the single row of just bunches, high on the grocer's shelf. Over the years, I had tried to find a granola cereal that could live up to the legend of the C.W. from my childhood. Sampling all that I could find, I had no luck equaling that wonderful crunchy taste.<br />Likely this new find, Just Bunches, would also disappoint, but I figured I should give it a try to see if it came at least close to what I remembered. It was from the Post people, perhaps they reached deep into their cereal recipe box and revived an old flavor from the past.... One could only hope.<br /><br />It the parking lot of the Grocery, I cracked open the box to give it a taste. Instantly I was transported back to my childhood, munching on cereal and watching Saturday morning cartoons, the road runner, bugs bunny, it all came back...<br /><br />I had found the 'holy Grail' of cereals.... ok, maybe that's taking it too far, but man its really good. So good, I subscribed for auto ship every month."
positive,1/7/21,"So far these have become my favorite granola bar from Nature Valley or anywhere else. I just discovered them a few months ago, and since my supply was getting low, I went to Wally world today and bought them out except for one box that was way in the back and beyond my reach.  Sometimes I'll have one in the morning and don't feel hungry for hours. They are very crunchy, and take awhile to chew since I don't want to do any damage to my teeth, and also  have high fructose corn syrup~ wish it was honey instead, but I like them."
positive,24/8/21,"Very tasty.<br /><br />It's hard to find something which has as much protein (6g) as sugars (6g).  I just wish that the sugars were really sugar instead of corn syrup; also, it would taste even better (in my opinion) if it had 2/3 as much sugar.  but still the best snack bar out there."
negative,21/7/21,"I have a picky dog with tummy troubles who has to eat a prescription diet.  She loves the Newman's treats but they are too hard for her since she is missing half her teeth.  Still, occasionally I hear a crunching sound and she is munching down a Newman's.  I was hoping she would knaw on these treats and thought the center would be a little easier to eat.  Here's how the trial went:<br /><br />Me:  opening the bag ""you want a treat?""<br />Dog:  tail wagging, ears perked up and looking at me intently<br />Me:  I pull one treat from the bag and hand it to her<br />Dog:  She takes it carefully and sets it on the floor. ""sniff, sniff"".  She looks back up at me.  ""sniff"".  She walks away and lays down in her bed.<br />Me:  I pick up the treat and sniff and don't smell anything.  This doesn't mean much since I'm not a dog.  I pull on the outside ""wrapping"".  It's pretty tough.  I push the middle up a little.  It's hard!  I was expecting a softer middle. I taste the middle.  It's tasteless.<br /><br />I tried again to tempt her with one of these treats by giving it to her in place of our nightly ""bite of cheese"" ritual.  Once again she just sniffed of it and then ignored it.  The other treats I've tried with her (beggin strips, puperoni, blue bison apple/yogurt biscuits, milk bone) she will either attempt to eat or carry around in her mouth for several minutes looking for a safe place to hide it.  These treats don't even get the honor of being buried."
positive,25/6/21,"I had a recipe for a pear-pomegranate pie which required this ingredient. I also used it in a blood orange, pomegranate, fennel, shallot, beet, feta cheese and toasted almond salad. I served both of these with a crown roast of pork with Cumberland sauce for Christmas dinner. This molasses is sour and sweet simultaneously and imparts an interesting taste but could, if used too lavishly, overhwhelm a dish."
positive,13/9/21,"This is my favourite tea! At work, I sometimes cannot get to it right away and it doesn't matter how long it sits, it doesn't get that bitter bitter ""like your drinking a dandelion"" taste. It's refreshing and I can't start my day without it!"
positive,18/6/21,"I don't eat right at all I am very picky and I use these to supplement my diet. Great source of vitamins. for on the go. I actually drink one for breakfast and one before bed. I buy at sams in bulk"
positive,7/7/21,"The taste of the onions in this first jar is not up to the standards I've come to expect with my many jars that I have purchased through the years."
positive,15/7/21,"Having usually eating store baught peanuts I'd have to say the taste was much to my supprise..  Very fresh and tasty.  Their about 1 1/2 times bigger than regular peanuts..  I'm glad I got them with the skins they were very tasty.. The salt just right."
positive,11/7/21,"I can't get this Panda Express in stores or restaurant locations anymore. It is fantastic stir fry sauce. I ordered it on Amazon. Price was good and shipping was fast. Will be ordering again."
positive,7/10/21,These cheese balls are hard to find...and these are so good...They melt in your mouth and are very cheesy..If you love cheese this is a must buy.
positive,6/7/21,Everyone that tastes these chips LOVE THEM!!!!!!!!! They all ask where they can get them.  Thank you for the email on when they were back in stock. I will be ordering more. My grandkids @ children raid the cupboards for them when they come by.
positive,18/6/21,I have bought a few of these along the years just from local stores and the flavor has been hit or miss. But these are great. Hold flavor and gives the right amount of heat to your food. I will buy this product again once I run out. Be sure to keep in fridge or freezer to keep oils fresh.
positive,7/7/21,I ate some raw and roasted most of them at low temp and put in the frig.  Nuts can go rancid so have a plan to preserve and store in frig or freezer when buying this amount of nuts. Good buy. Tasted fresh.
positive,27/7/21,"Mi-Del Old-Fashion ""Swedish Style"" Lemon Snaps are a crispy, chewy, lemony delight! If you are always in search of healthy snacks that aren't short on flavor, these are the cookies for you.<br /><br />These Lemon Snaps are made with organic unbleached wheat flour, canola oil and natural lemon flavor -- there's no artificial ""lolly-pop"" lemon taste here. You can just imagine squeezing the lemon into the mix, yourself.<br /><br />Five cookies have 140 calories, so it's not too much for a little something to get you through your day, or after dinner as a light dessert without the guilt.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Yum!"
positive,13/7/21,I had a variety of granola. And this one ranks of my top most favorites. It is a very crunch granola with a coconut main taste. It is sweet but not overly so. I eat at as a snack when im craving something. Fills you up very fast and satisfies any sugar cravings.
positive,13/9/21,"This Chipotle Sauce is very tasty, and it can be used with many different things. However I loved it the most with vegetarian meat (I'm a vegetarian, living healthy and all *grins*), and this sauce is amazing in a veggie sandwich, or with cooked vegetarian meat. However this sauce is very fattening, hence why I took one star out, it contains 11 grams of fat in 2 tbsp. So one needs to be careful to have it in very small portions, or make sure to have a good workout session after indulging in a good hearty meal containing this sauce.<br /><br />Overall I love this Chipotle sauce, very tasty."
positive,7/9/21,"I've tried using this on chicken and hamburgers and really liked it. It's a nice change from ketchup and BBQ sauces. The Chipotle has a spicy tang but it's overwhelming. It's probably even milder than the spicy sauces in an actual Taco Bell restaurant. It actually has a slightly sweet taste. It is a bit salty and creamy for those who are health conscious, but I find that even a small bit provides a lot of flavor and can be spread quite far over your meal. The bottle seems a bit smaller than you might expect, but other than that I'd recommend this."
positive,17/4/21,"Mexican spices are so good on many foods...this chipolte sauce has a great flavor, unlike other hot sauces...not very hot, quite mild, but intense... I have put it on everything, not just tacos..."
positive,10/3/21,"I was pleasantly surprised by the taste of the Chipotle Sauce.  It is kind-of like a spicy mayonnaise.  I used this sauce in tuna salad, on sandwiches and as a salad dressing.<br /><br />Similar to mayo, almost all of the calories come from fat.  I think it is tastier than mayo and has a nice amount of spice.  You can taste the pepper in the sauce but it doesn't leave your mouth burning.  It's a good balance of flavors."
positive,17/4/21,"I can't say I would've purchased this in the store, but having received it to taste (and test out) at home was certainly worthwhile. Surprisingly flavorful with a slight kick at the end, this sauce makes a great accompaniment to chicken sandwiches, salads, even chili. Yum yum."
positive,21/1/21,"This sauce tastes pretty good! It's creamy, spicy (but not overly so), and has a nice flavor that pairs well with burritos and other Mexican-style foods. That said, I think it's a little bit overpriced for what it is. The bottle is quite small. 8 fluid ounces is the two-thirds the size of a soda can, so the amount of sauce you get really isn't very much at all. They make the bottle wide and skinny so that it has the appearance of capacity. The concave curves on the side further deceive the eye. So in summary, what we have here is a tasty sauce offered for a high price. I would recommend perhaps looking for a single bottle at your local supermarket before committing to an entire six-pack, to see if the flavor is worth the cost for you."
positive,30/1/21,"This is a great tasting product.<br /><br />It can be used on more than just Mexican food. Tried it on hot dogs, and it was great. Not too spicy.<br /><br />Give it a try."
positive,13/2/21,"This Taco Bell Chipotle sauce is quite enjoyable and has the tangy yet not very spicy taste you would expect. I have used it on burritos and as a dip. There is no question that if you like the flavor of Chipotle sauce you will enjoy this. But it is high in calories which I expected and did not mind for you do not need a lot too enjoy the flavor.<br /><br />Yet two tablespoons of this sauce contains 100 calories from fat and a total of 110 calories per serving size. The serving size is the aforementioned two tablespoons. It taste great just be aware of its high fat content and calories. When serving size is measured by the spoon full you know the calories are high. And even so, I would get this product again."
positive,15/1/21,"Taco Bell's Bold & Creamy Chipotle Sauce is perfectly described in its name. This is a thick sauce with a strong smoky flavor and although it is quite spicy, there is little heat. I first used it to spice up black beans being served as a side dish for tacos. The beans are so bland, they always need something, and this sauce was the perfect addition.<br /><br />The sauce also worked beautifully with falafels - again, just the right amount of spice and it gave the pita bread sandwich stuffed with lettuce, tomato, cucumber and falafel balls a needed jolt. Finally, I used the sauce on a veggie burger and it also worked beautifully there, too. I was pleased with the results each time I used it, and found the sauce very versatile.<br /><br />The only negative is it not low on calories - two tablespoons have 110 calories and 100 of those are fat calories - so I use it sparingly. That said, it is sufficiently spiced so that a little goes a long way."
positive,6/3/21,"This is a wonderful product, and I am not one who dines at Taco Bell. I used to eat there when I was younger in college, but have not in years, so I was pleased to try this product and find that it was great!<br /><br />First, I like that the bottle is not so huge because the taste will stay fresh instead of getting stale from lack of use. I have many dressings and toppings etc. in my 'fridge, so it's nice to have a smaller bottle.<br /><br />Second, the taste is excellent. I love the creamy texture, and it has just a little ""heat"" from the chipolte flavoring to be interesting but not too hot.<br /><br />I used this on a home made taco salad, but I also used it as a sauce on a noodle dish I made that was like a south of the border spaghetti - grandchildren like noodles, so we made noodles and taco flavored meat and this sauce with a few veggies thrown in and had a Mexican style noodle dinner that they loved!<br /><br />So I highly recommend this product!"
positive,8/6/21,"This is a great sauce to use on sandwiches to give them a little extra kick.  Love it with grilled chicken, lettuce, and tomato.  I would thin it a bit to use on a salad, but it's just right with a sandwich.  Could get creative with it.  Meatloaf, maybe?"
negative,7/1/21,I ordered this product hoping it would really change my mind about using whey or soy. I didnt. I have to mix it with my other protein just so i can drink it. It taste like dirt and grass. Not s very good product.
positive,17/4/21,"These noodles take just a couple of minutes to make and there is only one flavoring pack.  IndoMie noodles are absolutely fantastic and cheaper, but take a little more effort to make - I buy both brands and use as the mood strikes me.  The reason I'm writing a review, however, is more about the price.  Every Asian store I've been to that sells this noodle pack charges around .68, so it's definitely worth buying these at an Asian store (though not all Asian stores sell Sapporo).  I'm hoping Amazon will start selling the boxes of these for less than the Asian stores sell single packets! (Hint . . . hint, Amazon.) Just a note,too - IndoMie noodles are about half the price of these, at least at the Asian markets."
positive,10/3/21,"easy to use because of the pre-measured packets, the smell and flavor are just like at the theater.  very good popcorn!  on the negative side, there are two comments: 1. I only put half of the seasoning because it is way too salty; 2. too many unpopped kernels.<br /><br />Otherwise, makes watching movies at home a lot of fun!"
positive,14/1/21,"Everyone in our family liked these chips.  Great taste and healthy compared to other chips.  If you like spicy food, you will enjoy these."
negative,24/5/21,"I typically go for breakfast blends, but this coffee simply tastes bad. I'd recommend trying some variety packs rather than buying one big pack as I did."
positive,14/10/21,"this brand has always amazed people with their coffee flavors, and the vermont country blend is just one of them, my husband and i tried it for the 1st time and we loved it...."
positive,7/2/21,"I love this raw cacao. This is a really good value. This is so much more expensive in Whole Foods.<br /><br />I make a banana ice cream/pudding with it that tastes amazing. 3-4 frozen bananas pureed with 1-2 teaspoons of raw cacao and a pinch of salt. I place it in the freezer for a bit to set. Simple, Healthy and toddler approved."
positive,29/3/21,Mat&eacute; is an awesome drink and Rosamonte makes an affordable and good tasting product. I would recommend this product to my friends and family.
positive,17/4/21,Never just made the orange by its self.  Miked it 50 50 with the cream soda made by the same company.  People were begging me for the recipy.<br /><br />I never follow the instructions.  i have tasted this brand of soda prepared very poorly.  not by me tho.<br /><br />Tip:  1 pound of sugar per gallon.  no more.  no less.  that is the master rule.
positive,10/3/21,"I actually liked the taste of this drink. I would drink it without the energy factor. The taste alone is the reason I give this product four stars. There are two servings in one can. I only drank one serving at a time. I could not detect any extra energy or alertness. I am a coffee drinker though. It does have caffeine in it, but not an excessive amount. Probably just the right amount so it doesn't give one the jitters. I liked it."
positive,10/7/21,"This tastes great. I can't say too much about the energy factor, although I should point out that energy drinks don't usually do much for me. It has a very nice mango flavor and doesn't taste like weird chemicals. Try it!"
positive,27/1/21,"This product has a very good taste, not like many of the other energy drinks.  It tastes like berries and is smooth, not tart, at least to me.  I had 2 four ounce glasses during the day.  I didn't notice a huge spike in energy, but I didn't need an afternoon nap either.  It didn't make me jittery etc. and I slept well at night.  I wish it came in a diet drink, no calories.  I would recommend this for the taste."
positive,1/6/21,"I enjoyed the taste of No Fear, but I can't say that it gave me any more energy than the other energy drinks on the market today.  Since I do, occasionally, indulge in a few energy drinks from time to time, I can say it delivered as much energy as other supplement brands. The four stars were mainly for the taste."
positive,20/8/21,"This brand of energy drink tastes good and really gives you a jolt of energy.  I didn't have jitters afterwards and I noticed a difference in focus.  I have problems with some of them making me jittery but this one really worked with no side effects."
positive,14/8/21,"We really enjoy De Boles Angel Hair pasta.  It isn't heavy and it is very tasty.  My kids are picky and this is the best product we have found to appease their request for quick and easy pasta."
positive,21/4/21,This is the best angel hair pasta as far as I am concerned.  The taste and texture are great.
positive,1/4/21,"This couscous is absolutely wonderful. The couscous is large pearl and is delicious served hot or cold.  Cooks beautifully -- delicious plain with mushrooms, mint or any one of a dozen other additions. Highly recommend it."
positive,17/4/21,"I usually order this product from the actual Gevalia site because this flavor is quite yummy.<br /><br />I also order the Cafe Sperl, which is also known as Viennese coffee.<br /><br />When you first open the bag, the nose is tickled with the pungent smell of chocolate and a lighter aroma of raspberry.<br /><br />The coffee tastes unique because of the raspberry flavoring, but it's enjoyable either freshly brewed or chilled."
positive,10/3/21,"I love this dressing! It has such a good fruity flavor! I've already recommended it to friends!"
positive,22/4/21,"I bought this for my hubby, he loves dark rich coffee & Dark Magic offers it. Great convenience of the Kcup makes it that much nicer."
positive,25/4/21,i love ordering on line esp from amazon>> just as i am about to run out of coffee i get a email re special deals<br />and i simply order and in a day the products are shipped<br />this coffee is fantastic<br />try it<br />also donut shop is great
positive,1/4/21,"I'm grateful for my Keurig coffee maker!  The taste of Green Mountain brand Dark Magic is terrific & got used up real fast!"
positive,30/6/21,"First, the nutrition facts:<br /><br />Serving size: 1/2 cup<br />Servings per container: about 7<br /><br />Calories: 220<br />Fat: 6g<br />Sodium 5mg<br />Carbohydrates: 37g (Dietary Fiber 4g, Sugars 13g, Other carbs 20g)<br />Protein: 5g<br /><br />This granola is really very tasty. The chocolate chunks add a nice flavor and texture, and the granola is very crunchy. It comes in a plastic zip-seal bag.<br /><br />With so much chocolate and sugars, this is by no means a ""health food"", but it's a great snack that at least has some nutrients, unlike candy bars for instance. And it tastes just as good, if not better.<br /><br />Disclosure: Although I was not paid for this review, I received one pouch of this product for free."
positive,1/3/21,"I confess I do not eat this granola from a bowl with milk, I keep it stored in an airtight container and use a shot glass to scoop out an ounce at a time for snacking.  Very easy to toss back using the shot glass and my fingers stay clean.  It is very good and has no bad ingredients."
positive,29/1/21,"This product is an alternative to eating granola bars. The only downside is that portion control is easy with a granola bar, whereas once you start eating this product out of the bag it is difficult not only to stop, but also to gauge how much you have eaten unless you first scoop out what you want, put it onto a plate, and weigh it on a food scale-- which I doubt most people will do.<br /><br />This is very tasty, and is about the same calories as a granola bar for a similar portion. While some of the pieces are chunks, other pieces are single granola flakes or chips, though this did not really bother me.<br /><br />Much as I like this, since it is not superior in taste to the chocolate chip granola bars that I eat, and since it is just too easy to eat a large portion, for now I will stick with my granola bars. But if portion control is not a concern, then this is a great snack."
positive,17/4/21,"I am by no means a granola connoisseur, but this stuff is pretty darn tasty.  This product is made with all natural ingredients. There honestly isn't a lot of chocolate in it -- just the right amount. It's dark chocolate but isn't too bitter or too sweet. Overall it's just a very nice blend and tastes delicious. Maybe a little pricey, but not a dealbreaker when considering it's made with real ingredients. I'd say 5/5 for taste, 3/5 for value. Recommended."
positive,10/3/21,"This granola is a mix of rolled oats and semi-sweet chocolate chunks.  I couldn't find a description on the bag as to whether it's a snack or a cereal.  As a snack, it's a bit dry for my taste and isn't as sweet as the delicious Quaker 100% Natural, but I quite enjoyed it with milk.  Its crunchy texture is just right and the chocolate is a treat.  If you like granola, this is a good one.  A good source of fiber."
positive,30/5/21,"I'm typically a tea drinker. After the first pot, I made coffee every day until it was gone. Would definitely recommend."
positive,28/9/21,"I'm a cherry nut! All the soda I drink has some sort of cherry flavour so I wanted to try this too. Great taste and how can I go wrong with Vitamin C thrown in for good measure? Will be most popular with those that already drink 'heathy' sodas, such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EOOQSO"">airforce Nutrisoda Flex, Black Cherry and Apple, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>."
positive,6/5/21,"I tried another of these Switch products and was less than pleased, but maybe it was the flavor which I think was supposed to be watermelon. The black cherry went down a lot easier although it's still a tad too acidic for me. But it tastes good, you know, like black cherry.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks"
positive,20/4/21,"I tried Samu on a whim, thinking that it would taste like many of the other coconut water drinks out there (perhaps healthy, but not terribly tasty). To my surprise, Samu is FANTASTIC. It tastes fresh, has the right amount of sugar, and brings a subtle pleasantness along with it. The design is pretty cool, and my purchase supported an independent label. I highly recommend this product and am sure that I will continue to purchase it."
positive,20/4/21,"This is a great quality olive oil with a slightly grassy overtone to the flavor. It's obviously a bit more expensive than your average everyday supermarket olive oil; but it is well worth the money."
positive,21/4/21,These are really good tasting lentils. The first thing I notice was the lack of that shinny coating you see on store bought lentils. When you open the big you can tell right away there is something different about these. They cook easily and hold their shape and taste great.
positive,2/5/21,"Excellent snack that's healthy and nutricious.  My son loves it!  It is a tad pricier than other brands but it tastes better."
positive,25/5/21,"This French Roast is by far my favorite. I like a strong tasting coffee. I also like the new packaging but I am glad that I didn't buy a Keurig K-Cup holder. The way this coffee is packaged you will have to put it in a covered container. This type of K-Cup recycles better too."
positive,7/9/21,"This product exceeded expectation, makes you feel better after drinking.  Will buy again.  Thank you Dr. Oz for talking about it on your show!"
positive,25/5/21,"Coffee preference is just a matter of taste, so my opinion regarding taste probably doesn't mean much. You'd have to try this coffee for yourself. What I can tell you is that these soft bottom cups are certainly different from the usual all-plastic k-cups. I was initially concerned about how well they would work in my Keurig, but after making about fifty or more brews, they work perfectly. No loose grinds left behind in the pod well, my mug or anywhere else. They cost a little less than k-cups so that's a nice plus for me. The minor drawback is that they come to you in plastic bags that once opened, allow exposure of the pods to air. Simple fix. I just put the remaining pods in a ziplock bag.<br />I like the taste of this French Roast coffee and the fact that it's also cheaper than the competition. Hopefully when the patent on k-cups expires this September we'll see more vendors offering better prices. This is probably why Keurig recently came out with a new brewer, ""the VUE""  that uses different and patented cups."
positive,22/5/21,"I received my package today, ""FOG CHASER"" and was the first cup really good. Full body and full taste just like it came ground fresh....and no, i don't know or work for the company, just thought you would like an honest review from someone that buys 6-8 boxes of K-cup coffee a month.<br />I noticed NO sediment in my cup and yes they cut the corner by leaving off the pastic cup to avoid the copyright that says they would then owe Kuerig a percentage....which drives up the price of all coffe in K-cups. IT'S NOT A K-CUP, BUT WILL FIT A K CUP MAKER, and that is what they advertise.<br /><br />I can live with putting the filter cups in a baggie. I don't need to show off my coffee in a carousel, so this is just great to get a ""subscription discount"" for this good of a coffee that will fit my k-cup brewer."
positive,19/7/21,"Was buying the Kona Blend until it dried up and then the price went through the roof. Tried several different K-Cup coffees until I found the Fog Chaser. Now I have it on my subscribe and save list. I have it sent to my office, my home, my son's home every month. It ain't Kona but it is almost as bold, the aroma fills the kitchen in the morning and that first sip is great every time.<br />And at 1/2 the price of the Kona, it is the ""best bang for the buck"". I'll never go back."
positive,7/9/21,"As many other reviews have mentioned, these are not the normal K-Cups, but they work much the same. I generally drink the stronger K-cups (Emeril's, Jet Fuel, Kona, etc), and I find that these Fog Chaser pods compare very favorably. There is no bitter aftertaste, just smooth flavor. I have not had any sediment at the bottom of my cup (I've had sediment from other K-Cups). I think people are a bit thrown by the smell of the coffee bag when they get it, as it is a much stronger smell than you'll get from a box of K-Cups. It does smell like when you open a fresh bag/can of ground coffee, which is sort of refreshing after using K-Cups for 3 years. We've just finished the first bag of 12 (6 days), which we kept in a ziplock bag, and the last cup tasted as good as the first. I already placed a subscribe and save order for the French Roast to try out. I will be keeping my subscription for the Fog Chaser, as it is quite good."
positive,25/8/21,"This product makes a great cup of cofee, bold but not bitter, no bad after taste. The smell starts the experience  and the satisfied full flavor follows. I will buy this product as long as it is available !!"
positive,6/9/21,5MM Pink Edible Pearls are a wonderful addition to cakes & cookies!  They can instantly add sophistication to any piece!
positive,25/5/21,"I just have to say that I agree with the first reviewer.  I really had a good experience with this product.  I was buying it for a friend, it came very quickly, the product is unique, and it is something that everyone can use.  The customer service was outstanding."
positive,7/9/21,"Great tasting.  Kids love them and I don't have to worry that there are any genetically engineered ingredients.  A little pricey if you don't care if they are organic."
positive,13/10/21,"Out of all their different kinds of cookies, this is the one that rocks.<br /><br />You would never know this was gluten free."
positive,2/10/21,"I got this as a small gift for my girlfriend who was always forgetting to buy more cheap popcorn at the store. I thought she would enjoy some unique and gourmet popcorn and I was right - she really liked them, especially the purple kind. We cook it on the stove with oil and it worked perfectly. However, don't be an idiot like me and splash oil all over your face! Does NOT feel good. Popcorn has a great, distinct flavor and I think we will be returning for more."
positive,23/9/21,"This product is pretty delicious.  I love using stevia instead of other fake sugars because it's a natural product and seems less likely to cause cancer.  I wish more things would use it instead!"
positive,26/6/21,"If you love the flavor of toasted pecans, this coffee is for you.  Great flavor, good coffee taste.  It was very easy to brew the right strength. What a pleasure to wake up to the smell of toasted pecans and freshly brewed coffee! This is the second time I've purchased this coffee and I'll definitely do it again."
positive,25/5/21,I received a small box of these Ginger and Honey crystals and I fell in love with them! What a great way to bump up your cup of hot tea. They are strong and I would recommend starting with a small portion. I ordered two bags of thirty packs and now my Daughter in Law wants a 30 Pack. Love It!
positive,7/9/21,We can get these crackers locally but the price is a lot higher.  I absolutely love these crackers and they have a deep rich cheese flavor.  I will continue to purchase these crackers from Amazon to complement any holiday.
positive,15/7/21,"I'm thrilled with this extract. I ordered it on a Tuesday night and had it by Friday afternoon. It came wrapped nicely in plenty of bubble wrap and tissue paper and was accompanied by a nice little note from the seller thanking me for my order.<br /><br />It smells wonderful. It smells just like cocoa powder, and I use it in all my baked goods and even savory foods. Added to gravy it gives it that little something extra, and it's phenomenal in whipped cream, cookies, brownies, sweetbreads, cakes, even coffee and hot chocolate. It's not a sweet extract so it gives some depth to foods without adding additiona sugar. I will definitely be ordering this in the future and definitely ordering from this merchant again. I am very impressed with the quality and the customer service provided!"
positive,3/6/21,"Very flavorful and gives amazing taste to salads and food in general. Just a pinch make a huge difference in the way your food tastes like.  This is the only type of salt I am using since I discovered it. I put it on meat, fish, veggies, salads, soups,etc. Everything tastes better with this salt. I wish they would offer it in bigger sizes. I usually order 4 at a time so they last for a while since the size is small. You will not be sorry for ordering this salt."
positive,27/9/21,We love these little figs.  They are a great snack and a pop in your mouth size. Will definately buy them again.
positive,19/6/21,"I got this for my kids easter basket just to have something different and they loved it.  It tastes great and even travels well.  This is a great treat to take in the car or stick in a purse for that time when you are craving ice cream but can't have it."
positive,25/5/21,"True the flavor doesn't last for a long time, but it tastes great and lasts long enough!"
negative,7/9/21,First let me say I am a huge fan of endangered species chocolate.  This is my first time however trying this particular mixture.  I love orange and chocolate as a combination but this one definitely falls short.  Unfortunately from what I can gather and the type of bitterness it is I am guessing they add too much of the pith while creating the orange oil.  It has a smooth delightful start but the more you eat the more pronounced the bitter taste becomes.  I am disappointed by the purchase and will not order this type again.
positive,3/8/21,"I use this treat as a reward for getting on the grooming table.  My three dogs ""line up"" when I pick up the grooming brush.  What a treat!"
positive,5/9/21,"Very good. Tastes like Original Jack Links only with a little more flavor. Very tender and not dry, but a little on the salty side. The bag is HUGE though and there is a tiny amount in the bag! It's disappointing."
positive,25/5/21,"After having been diagnosed with a thyroid nodule, which later turned out to be cancer, I thought I had better try to get more iodine in my and my family's diet.  After researching some, I found that Dulse is a great natural source of iodine.  I tried a package of this, and found that it is pretty good.  The package came with a suggestion to stir-fry it a few minutes in a hot skillet, to make it like ""chips"", which I tried.  I and my family enjoyed it much better that way.  The quality of this dulse is great, and the price seemed comparable with others I could find.  I ordered more of this, and am using it as a regular supplement to our diet."
positive,7/9/21,"This is a must have snack.  If you like lemonheads and almonds you can't go wrong.  I found these in Walgreens so I decided to give them a try.  I was hooked!!!! They are addicting.  I have been looking all over for the Lemonhead Almonds.  Luckily, Amazon came to the rescue and I was able to purchase two bags.  You won't regret buying them.  Yummy!!!!!"
positive,11/9/21,My son loves this food combination and eats it without any complaints. The ingredients are simple and the taste is straightforward - no funky baby food smell like the normal food in jars often has. I will buy again and again.
positive,13/7/21,The taste of this Balsamic Vingear is very good for the price!!! Vinegar comes in a spray bottle wonderful for salads & cuts down on waste when you added to anything else!!! Vinegar comes in a six pack each bottle 8.5 Ounces.Price $33.25 for six pack but some of the Very Best sells for Over $100 a 4 Ounce bottle. I never tasted that Quality but like I stated earlier DeLallo tastes deliteful & its made in Italy!!!
positive,22/7/21,"Being diabetic, I always carry one of these little delicious, no added sugar snacks in my purse, in case I need a pick-me-up to prevent low blood sugar. Another thing in its favor is this snack is gluten-free. Ordering from Amazon is fast, and they always seem to have the food products that I need."
positive,22/6/21,"These cookies not only taste great, but they are prepackaged so you can just throw them in a lunchbox.  When you have a child on a gluten-free diet, saving time on food prep is always appreciated.  They are definitely a favorite in my house.  We love them.  They are small in size, but are the best tasting chocolate chip cookie so far that we have found gluten-free."
positive,28/7/21,"These chips make a wonderful snack.  They give you the crunch and saltiness that you need at times, without a lot of calories.  They also contain protein to keep you from getting hungry again until meal time.  They came in a single serving size package which is nice when you are mindful of portion control.  I would order them again."
positive,13/10/21,These treats are great.  The dog is crazy about them.  They are small but he really likes them.  You can also use them to conceal small pills if you need to give your dog medicine.
positive,19/2/21,"I ordered the hot mix by mistake because I didn't read carefully enough. It didn't matter this mix is great and not burn your face off hot, which I hate.  Super easy and quick to make and very tasty.  Highly recommended."
positive,14/12/20,"These pistachios are a ton better than you can get at Trader Joe's. High quality and great taste."
positive,14/12/20,"These were the best, and somehow fresher-tasting, that we have enjoyed, yet!  A good buy!"
positive,19/2/21,"It tastes great. I've only used it as a supplement and not in cooking. Also, Some people had given concerns over packaging, but mine was completely fine."
positive,10/1/21,"This curry paste has a geat taste, we use it in soups, stir fries, vegetable dishes and anything you would like to add some extra zing to."
positive,26/3/21,If you like spicy...then these are the snack crackers for you. So hard to find ANYWHERE ELSE...a really good price on here!
positive,24/3/21,"Amber, our Golden Retriever, ate this food right up.  She gave it 5 stars and said it was delicious.  We noticed that the food is ""puffed up.""  That's neither good or bad, just an observation.  I suppose if you have limited storage space, it would be an issue.  The food we normally give her is definitely more compact, and less airy."
positive,24/2/21,"I bought this Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water for my husband. He loves it! He tryed all different kind of coconut drinks, but there were with some preservatives and other junks (there were not tasty at all). This one taste great and is healthy!"
positive,19/2/21,"I love this stuff! I could drink it all day long! Nice and smooth going down and extremely refreshing! The amount you get for the price is just perfect. I have caught flack because it is ""expensive"" but this is the best Coconut Water on the market."
positive,14/12/20,Shipping was fast. The taste is great and reminds me of drinking from a real chilled green coconut on the sidewalk in Thailand.
negative,19/10/21,"This is mostly dry croutons with very little flavor. I need to try to find some way to salvage this mix as no one will eat it the way it is right now. I was expecting something more like Chex Party Mix, but was greatly disappointed. It should have much more flavor/spice to be enjoyable as a snack mix. As it is, it has less flavor than a bag of salad croutons or plain pretzels."
positive,18/5/21,"An other reviewer was right, these are better then wheat thins, and I bought those for a long time for the crunch.  I think it's the sea salt that makes them tastier."
positive,19/2/21,I have been trying to give up soda and I found that the Sparkling Ice Spring Water is a great Substitute. Love the taste!!!! Bob
positive,14/12/20,"Kraft homestyle mayonnaise is rich and creamy. A very good quality mayonnaise. I will certainly buy more of same. Previously I've bought mayonnaise that sits in the fridge for ages. Maybe for generations! This mayonnaise will go fast because it taste so good. I've used on tuna, hard boiled eggs and salad. I highly recommend."
positive,1/6/21,"I always have a case or two of Maruchan ramen in the pantry. Their shrimp flavor is especially good. I always drain the soup off the noodles before I serve them. I especially like it with some spinach sauteed with an onion and a head of garlic -- seriously, try it, it's remarkably flavorful and costs next to nothing. Or just the noodles with some chopped green onion to dress them up. Or with a little curry powder. I've tried Top Ramen in the past but prefer Maruchan."
positive,1/4/21,"This is a very good product and comes very close to ""fresh from the kitchen"" but breaking the clumps/adding the water to get the right consistency isn't as easy as one would think."
positive,15/4/21,"This is a very nice green tea.  I had to try it since I love anything mango.  The flavor is perfect whether its hot or iced or with some creamer.  It smells amazing as well, just like a real mango!  I'd like it if the packing was more eco-friendly like Celestial Seasonings, but its still pretty nice.  The packets are individually sealed and there are no staples on on the bag so you don't get any weird taste added to the tea."
positive,19/5/21,"My kids love Hamburger Helper so I figured this would be a great new product to try since anything with Velveta is good!  It was easy to make and only took a few minutes to complete.  The kids absolutely loved it and I thought it tasted great too.  My only complaint was that, visually, it was unappetizing.  It didn't look like the picture on the box.  It was kind of a grayish brown color and actually worried me a bit before I tried it.  Luckily, my kids and I don't really care how it looks so we all enjoyed it, but Kraft would benefit by working on presentation."
positive,19/2/21,"Having a busy schedule, I can appreciate an easy boxed meal to cook every now and then. I'd have to say I prefer this brand to Hamburger Helper because of the taste and the quality of the product. Instructions were easy to follow, the food was tasty and it's a nice back up to have in the pantry when you don't feel like making a meal from scratch."
positive,14/12/20,"My husband loves velveeta shells and cheese so we HAD to try these!! Very quick and easy. Don't need anything but the meat. But you may want to add a salad or some veggies for a round dinner! :)"
positive,28/7/21,"This is pretty tasty if you eat this sort of thing, and I'll admit it's a rare guilty pleasure for me.  As compared to the brand that is no doubt its main competitor, I thought this one tasted better, probably because of the already mixed almost-cheese sauce that is included (which also replaces the milk that's usually added).<br /><br />It's pretty much a toss-up in terms of nutrition, given that we aren't looking at a nutritional champ to begin with here.  As prepared, this one has 350 calories per serving, the other 310.  This has 140 calories from fat, the other 110.  This one has 850 mg of sodium, the other one has 810.  The Kraft Velveeta Cheesy Skillet comes out slightly ahead overall, with protein of 8 g compared to the other's 3 g and dietary fiber of 1 g compared to less than a gram for the competitor.  These differences are probably attributable to the ""cheese"" sauce.  The sauce also pushes this one over the edge for total fat, with 9 g for this one and 0.5 for the other.  After the ground beef is added, the difference is 25% of the recommended daily amount vs. 19% (virtually none of it ""good"" fat in either one).<br /><br />It is significant that although both brands claim zero transfat, both also list partially hydrogenated oil as one of their ingredients, meaning they certainly do contain transfat, just less than the half-gram per serving that would require full disclosure.  If you eat the whole package - about 5 cups, so realistically with a dinner and a leftover lunch or two, you easily might - you could get whacked with as much as 2.4 g of transfat, not to mention the saturated fat in the ground beef you add to both.  At 800+ grams of sodium, you probably need to skip another meal that day to avoid going over the recommended daily value for sodium, too.  You might consider fasting that day if you plan to eat more than one serving!<br /><br />But, as I said, it's a guilty pleasure; by definition, that's not the most nutritionally sound choice that can be made.  In any case, all other things (price, availability) being equal, I will probably choose this one if I choose it again."
positive,29/6/21,"I was skeptical to buy this because I've bought ""cheap"" coffee before I'm always disappointed with its taste.  This tastes great and the environmental factor is just a bonus for me!"
positive,15/10/21,"I ordered this delicious Kadayif dessert for my sister's birthday with her present that I also bought it at amazon took  them to my parents house to celebrate at their house.everyone at the party enjoyed this delicious kadayif I served it with some turkish coffee it was the best dessert I ever tried everyone said where did I buy it from I said amazon of course they have anything and everything you want to get quality exceptional prices very low.My son told everybody that I live in amazon website because I'm there looking at it everyday to catch those bargains.Thank you amazon as allways bringing us the International flavors to our homes."
positive,20/7/21,"This was a very pleasant surprise. I was a bit hesitant when I read through the ingredients. Sure, it sounded healthy, but would it taste good?<br /><br />In a word, outstanding! Good crunch, flavor and just the right amount of salt. Great to see that there's snack foods available that are a lot better for you than the usual chips and nachos.<br /><br />The only problem is that everyone likes them, so they disappear quickly!"
positive,12/10/21,"I love tortilla chips, just good ol' fashioned corn chips with salt on them.  I was curious as to how these fancy tortilla chips would fare.<br /><br />Before even tasting these chips, the bag shows that the company is serious about freshness.  It's tough and a little slippery; I almost couldn't open it by hand.  The chips are little hexagons about 1"" in diameter, with the various seeds clearly visible in the chips.  While the corn flavor is dominant, the various other elements of these chips really blend well to give them a unique flavor.  They're not overly salty - indeed, if I had any quibble, it's that a little more salt would be appreciated.<br /><br />These chips would be an excellent choice for finger foods for a higher end dinner party, a date, or just an evening when you want to treat yourself."
positive,19/2/21,"I liked the flavor and texture of the tortillas.  They are not spicy, but the taste is not bland because of the olives. The chips are small and the serving size in the bag is just enough for a quick, satisfying snack."
positive,14/12/20,"These chip/crackers were very tasty... however people who have allergies or problems digesting corn - like me - need to beware. If you just read the front of the packet it seems as if they are made without wheat or corn. Not true, the main ingredient is corn."
positive,2/7/21,These chips are great tasting!  You have to try them if you like sweet potatoes.
positive,11/3/21,"I am munching on these chips as I type, trying to keep the salt off my fingers and from going on the keys. I like the way they taste. The flavors are mainly of stone-ground corn, but you can tell there are other ingredients, as well. There's a nice nutty aftertaste. I like texture, too. Just the right amount of crunch.  These chips aren't overly salty, either, another plus.<br /><br />Nutrition-wise, these chips rank among the more healthy versions.  There are only 140 calories in a one ounce serving, a lot less than the normal 200+ I see on similar products, and the amount of fat and sodium is a lot lower, too. It's got 3g of fiber = 11% of an average daily requirement. There are no trans fats cholesterol, preservatives, etc.  It seems that the FoodShouldTasteGood company made a sincere effort to produce as healthy a product as was possible given the ingredients and requirement to make something that tastes good.<br /><br />One reviewer said the chips were too hard and tasted stale.  My own experience was that the chips tasted fresh and were crunchy but by no means any harder or crunchier than a regular tortilla chip.  The expiration date on the bag is in November.  With no preservatives, it seems odd that the bag the other reviewer tried had an expiration date more than a year away.<br /><br />My only hesitation would be the price.  Currently these chips aren't in stock on Amazon and there is no pricing given so I would say you'd have to evaluate whether or not you wanted to pay that much for chips, even though they seem better for your health than other brands and they taste good, as well."
positive,10/4/21,"I just got home from a long trip and was faced with making dinner.  Luckily, the Velveeta Cheesy Skillet dinner was sitting in my pantry.  I browned a pound of chicken breast strips and followed the directions.  It was a quick and easy dinner for the family and everyone enjoyed it.  The ingredients come in 4 different packets - the pasta (orzo I think), seasonings, dehyrated broccoli and Velveeta cheese sauce.  After browning the chicken, just add the seasoning and pasta along with about 2 1/2 cups of water and cover.  In about 7 or 8 minutes, add the dehydrated broccoli and cook another 2-3 minutes.  Then remove from heat and add the cheese sauce.  My kids loved it and there was plenty for everyone.  I found it to be better tasting than Chicken Helper and easier to prepare.  My only complaint was the miniscule amount of broccoli.  It was more like a sprinkling of dried parsley than broccoli florets.  Of course, you can always add your own fresh or frozen broccoli or other veggies to make it healthier and heartier.  Overall, a good choice for a hectic night when you don't have much time to cook and a lot of hungry little mouths to feed."
positive,22/7/19,"Wanted apricots to try making gluten free granola.<br />While I would have preferred unsulphered apricots<br />they are so nasty looking I didn't think my family<br />would eat them!  Everyone loves these!  Very good<br />price too."
positive,2/2/20,I mix this seasoning with Hunts BBQ sauce and the mix taste great on chicken. The only problem this product has is that if the enviroment you live is a bit humid the seasoning absorbs the humidity of the ambient and hardens..
positive,2/2/20,"I've made these for friends (both gluten-intolerant and not), and everybody loves these! They do not taste like they're gluten-free! Excellent job by Nuffins to mix convenience with quality and health."
positive,31/8/19,"Great tasting, rich flavor, perfect for making a nice hot cup of Mocha. I bought this to test it against Hershey's syrup for my Mocha and there is an incredible distinct taste difference that is noticeable. This is much richer and tastes more like chocolate, and less sugary then Hershey's syrup."
positive,22/7/19,"Gerber's Peach Cobbler tastes amazing...just like real peach cobbler but without the added sugars and butter.  My husband and I tried it to see why our daughter liked it so much and we quickly figured out that it was the best tasting baby food we've purchased and at a great price."
positive,12/1/20,"This soup is quick and tasty. Microwaves in no time. Let it sit a few minutes so the tofu and seaweed can mature to full blossom. I purchased thinking it was a miso soup but it is not, at least related to the miso soups I get at my local oriental restaurants."
positive,19/2/20,Will definitely buy again. I sent this to a deployed soldier who shared it with the other boys and they all love it! Great flavour.
positive,27/11/19,"While these are expensive for the calories, they are one of few foods that can actually be eaten before strenuous exercises such as biking. I also like these at 2am when I am rolling out of my sleeping bag to summit a mountain. Very tasty indeed."
positive,12/12/19,"This is really yummy instant coffee. I like the fine, powdery texture. However, I am not convinced it is organic coffee.....as the amazon description states. The can does not say anything regarding organic ingredients. Maybe since it is produced outside the US, it's not labeled as such?? But, I will not be re-ordering due to that."
positive,26/9/20,These taste fantastic!! And Amazon sells them for a less expensive price than my local health food store! Thank you Amazon!
positive,22/7/19,"These grapes are very tasty, the right mixture of sweet and tart.  Very light and so good I ate the whole bag in 1 day,  I will purchase it again."
positive,2/2/20,"Coffee flavor is so personal.  I love the taste of this coffee. I gave one to a friend at work and he thought it was much to strong. He freely admits that he has no problem drinking the company supplied coffee that sits in the big metal coffee urn all day,  My other friend drinks this kona blend  black and he loves it. I'm not a huge coffee snob, I drink Maxwell House French Roast at home. I  look forward to having a good tasting cup of coffee at work and this really fits the bill. I put sweetener and cream in my coffee so it's important to get coffee that has flavor can stand up to the added ingredients..  Even with cream and sugar the flavor is bold and smooth."
positive,23/5/20,The CHocorooms are so good and tasty with no cholesterol!!!  The kids love them and they are a perfect size for them to think they are getting a lot of sweets.
positive,22/11/20,"These were pretty tasty! They dont stick in your teeth like other fruit snacks which is a HUGE plus, but even better they're all natural and good for you. I'll buy them again for sure. Soon-- when this box runs out."
positive,30/3/20,"You can smell the spinach! It seems fresh and tastes wonderful. I fed it to my 2nd son when we were on the go during his babyfood stage and gave it to my preschooler as a snack. Now both often reach for these as a snack and I'm happy to offer them something other than cheerios or graham crackers when we're on the go."
positive,8/7/20,My son loves these pouches. It is a quick and easy way to get fruits and veggies into a picky eater. He loves the flavor and will grab these from me and eat the entire pouch.<br /><br />I love that it is organic and healthy. The fruits overpower the veggies which helps in making the flavor more acceptable to younger children.<br /><br />It is easy to grab on the way out of the door as a quick snack or as a complement to eating out.<br /><br />I highly recommend!
positive,4/1/20,"They used to carry a large jar of this at a local store, but I never saw it again after a few years ago and was deeply saddened. It is delicious with brie on a cracker (though I found out I am allergic to dairy so no more for me!) but it can also be used as a glaze, eaten on french bread, toast or in spoonfuls from the jar! I love this stuff. I only wish it came in a big tub that would last you the rest of your life."
positive,30/1/21,"This was the first time we've had tings - a friend told us about them and since since they ended up being 2.17 per bag - we gave them a shot.  My daughter has a severe milk intolerance and I have a wheat allergy - and it's rare to find something delicious that we can both have.  My daughter is 2 years old and can now enjoy cheetos just like her friends - and they taste wonderful!  I'm so thankful for products like these that taste good, help us feel normal, and are affordable!  If I could give 6 stars I would!"
negative,2/11/20,"The chips had an odd texture, tasting nothing like a corn chip. The seasoning was more of a salsa flavor than a cheese. It was even difficult to give these away to people"
positive,17/10/20,"Since I'm vegetarian I don't use meat with this, but rather a bunch of portobello mushrooms and a whole onion.  Turns out fantastic and the leftovers are even better the next day.  Could use a few more noodles in the box, but I just buy egg noodles separately and add a few."
positive,22/7/19,I had these when in the Phillippines and then when I came had to have some more.  Even though this a large bag we go through these fast in about two weeks.
positive,2/2/20,Much fresher than the usual sun maid i buy at store. Less sugar too so they taste at a much higher quality. I will continue to buy these in bulk to save $. Hopefully the seller is reading my interview and sends me a code for discount since I gave a generous review
positive,4/10/20,"It's somewhat hard to find a Macadamia Syrup but I happen to love this particular flavor.  My first order off Amazon of a different brand broke and was then discontinued so I gave this one a try and I'm happy I did!  It's quite tasty and comes with a pump which is a nice touch.  There are quite a few servings in each bottle and it's perfect for Italian Soda.  Also from a practical standpoint they are using plastic bottles for the shipped product which makes it much less likely to break in transit."
positive,1/4/20,This is absolutely delicious! My husband has had it on vanilla ice cream every night since it arrived. Just the right blend of chocolate and raspberry.
positive,8/5/20,"I love Blueberry coffee... and this was very good... But if you purchase, do not get whole bean, get it ground before they send it. The oils in the flavoring make it tough on some grinders."
positive,18/6/20,"I bought this product from vitacost.  I really enjoyed the fresh healthy flavor.  I decided to purchse from Amazon because it's in bulk thereore cheaper.  It'sso worht it. I've tried a lot.  This mix really impressed me.  No chocolate to melt in the car."
positive,20/8/20,"My husband and I love this ketchup! To me, the taste is better than the regular Heinz ketchup. The color and texture are exactly the same, but the flavor is better. You can't beat Organic!!"
positive,1/6/21,"The spice and flavor go hand-in-hand, so I usually add all of the flavor packet. I make these slightly soupy, and I often discard a little of the broth to reduce sodium levels + spare my digestive tract from the ravages of my taste buds. Also great (and more of a meal) with egg stirred in near the end. I could eat these every day, but alas, that would have dire consequences.<br /><br />Taking the nutritional drawbacks as a given, these are 5* for price/flavor."
positive,4/7/21,"If you like spicy noodles and don't really feel like taking time to make it, this comes really close.  Instant noodle at its best!  Just boil some water, toss the noodles in, add some vegie, kamaboko, tofu (whatever you like and have)..., that will actually look like a fancy bowl of noodles when you are done in less than 5 mins."
positive,5/2/20,"They're not for the faint of heart. I get so bored with most foods that claim to be spicy hot, but Shin Ramyun delivers. And it's not just hot, it's got great taste. I've been buying them by the 20-pack for years and loving every bite."
positive,22/7/19,"This ramen is so good. I also bought the Neoguri- also a good choice if you like seafood. I would highly recommend this. It microwaves well, I use pyrex. I'm deployed on a ship and it was sent out here pretty quick (relatively speaking ok? lol) and none of the ramen was damaged during VERTREP. It is spicy! Definitely seriously spicy. I cook it with minimal water so it stays that way. I love it. Will buy again. It's pretty much the highlight of my day."
positive,2/2/20,"I enjoy these noodles over most other noodles. It's spicy enough to make my nose run, which I like, and the noodles have a nice texture to them."
positive,22/11/20,"This is a knockout bold coffee. It is great cup at the 12oz setting with tons of flavor. Haven't tried it yet at the 16oz setting but assume it will still pack a flavor punch. Great deal in the 50 pack."
positive,1/3/20,If you like bold taste...then add it to your cart because you will love this coffee. This is one of my variety that I choose on a morning I need a jump start or a lecture from my Mom. Ha
negative,23/11/20,"Just when i got my shipment i tried it out on my pit but he only ate portion of it and he never ate it after that. So i also tried it on my rottweiler and she does not like it also. The only way they would eat it is if i add some caned meat with it then they would, but that shouldn't be the case. so i don't recommend."
positive,5/4/21,"Rarely can I say that a GF product tastes better than the gluten version.  Thse cookies do, though.  Melt in your mouth delicious, and just the right amount of lemon.  I am confident tht if you gave these to gluten eaters, they would not be able to tell the difference."
positive,27/4/20,"these little cookies taste fantastic! not too sweet, just right....chocolate melts easily, so we will be ordering these in the cooler months only"
positive,8/3/21,"This product is very tasty but if you are also lactose intolerant, better forgo the pleasure.  Milk is not listed on the allergy advisory (May contain traces of...) but the ingredients section lists whole milk powder as a component of the chocolate coating.  Otherwise, it's a great product."
positive,30/1/20,"THIS WAS BEYOND MY EXPECTATIONS.  THE VARIETY WAS A GREAT BLEND OF DIFFERENT SOUPS AND SO EASY TO FIX.  EVEN MY HUSBAND LIKED THEM.  I QUICKLY ORDERED ANOTHER SET, BECAUSE IT WAS SO GOOD.  TASTY AND EASY"
negative,22/7/19,"I love regular merengue cookies and I normally don't have a problem with sugar free, but these cookies had a terrible taste and worse texture.  Stick to the non sugar-free."
positive,2/2/20,"This tea has the real flavor of pumpkin.  It is nicely spiced and perfect for an autumn afternoon.  It is quite highly caffeinated so I do not drink it late at night.  But overall, a lovely tea."
positive,2/9/20,"This fondant was very smooth and easy to work with along with having a good taste.  You don't always get good taste in fondant."
positive,26/1/21,Definitely a very good jerky - not dry or chewy at all. Very tasty - did not need any extra flavoring. We went thru the 8 packs pretty fast even though they were supposed to last a while...
positive,9/1/21,We use this popcorn in an air popper on the weekends. It is delicious and tastes much better than anything we have been able to find in the stores.
positive,30/7/21,"I was looking for a hulless popcorn (due to my diverticulitis, boy do I miss popcorn) and tried this based on the reviews. I was disappointed that this has way to many hulls for ME (the hulls do not disappear or get so small) but the flavor of the popcorn is amazing, very very tasty, my family loves it so I will buy it again.  We air popped it, sprayed it with a little cooking oil and sprinkled some popcorn flavored seasoning ""butter.""  Hardly any calories but lots of taste :) They are tiny when they pop so you really should not flood it with anything heavy or it will turn to mush."
positive,30/10/20,"I bought this from my local health food store, It has a wonderful coconut taste. I use it in everything from my morning oatmeal  to yogurt. I put some in my dogs food and their coats have been so shiny and soft. I also suffer from a dry flakey scalp so i massage a small amount into my hair and let it sit for 30 minutes before i shampoo it out, it leaves my hair so soft and shiny. it is a great waterproof mascara remover too. I will be buying this item in bulk! I love all the benefits coconut oil has to offer."
positive,3/8/20,"These almonds are the best. I love the tasted but was not quite as zippy or strong as I had hoped. I do eat lots of hot items so perhaps my taste buds are expecting more. Having said that, the flavor and freshness is tops."
positive,29/1/21,"This was my first time ordering from this company. They're fast and a great product. Will def be ordering more flavorings in the future."
positive,24/10/21,This is a great Olive oil. Great price.  I love Colavita products in general.<br />Delivery was fast. Shipping was a bit pricey.
positive,24/10/21,"This is a really great product, not sweet at all. The name describes it perfectly. However I am not sure why it is $40 a case. I would buy it in the store. Much cheaper"
positive,16/10/21,"This has a strong granny smith apple taste. I eat apples all the time, so if anyone says otherwise they are mistaken. Same texture, just a different and better taste. Now I'm purchasing three packs a week because it taste so good. Tasty enough to substitute an unhealthy dessert for this tasty treat."
positive,24/10/21,"Very good flavor and not filled with a bunch of chemicals. Although there are still questions about some of the ingredients, it is a great alternative to what's on the shelf in the grocery store."
positive,25/9/21,A must for anyone who loves to cook.  This sauce along with the Raspberry Chipotle are so tasty and add a nice twist to spice up otherwise boring chicken and steak. Also makes a nice and cost effective gift.
positive,19/10/21,"The coffee has a bold without bitterness taste.  It is very delicious. I enjoy drinking Grove Square Coffee, Dark Roast every morning."
positive,20/10/21,"I wasn't too sure about trying this product because the price seemed too good to be true-gluten free products are usually so much more expensive. What a pleasant surprise! We really liked it, we really liked it! Seriously, this product is worth a try. I used it for a base for lasagne and for a change from the regular spaghetti noodles. Delicious!"
positive,19/10/21,"I just found PB2 and PB2 with chocolate and I am thrilled.  I love sugary goodies but I'm not a fan of calories and I don't like chocolate.  I thought I'd try PB2 with chocolate anyway and I'm so glad I did!  Eating a serving or two of PB2 with chocolate satisfies my sweet craving without breaking my calorie bank!  Sometimes, when I want to splurge, I spread some PB2 with chocolate on a graham cracker, spread some marshmallow fluff on another and sandwich them together! YUM!"
positive,15/6/21,The chocolate PB2 is just as amazing as the regular PB2 - plus a healthy indulgence. I love to use it as a dip for animal crackers! Also great on apple wedges.
positive,4/8/21,This product tastes great. I use it in my protien shakes to help mask the tastes of some of the flavors I have tried and do not like. With the PB2 I now like the taste of the shakes and use this every day. I prefer the PB2 with coco powder but both products taste great.
positive,4/8/21,I order this because of the other reviews.  It is really good.  Went to their website to get more receipes.
positive,18/7/21,I USED TO PURCHASE THESE AT MY LOCAL WAL-MART BUT THEY DO NOT CARRY THEM ANYMORE AND WHEN I LOOKED AT OTHER STORES THEY WERE SOOOO EXPENSIVE.<br />I DECIDED TO CHECK ONLINE AND WAS ABLE TO ORDER THEM AT A REASONABLE PRICE AND RECEIVED THEM PRETTY QUICK.<br />NOW I AM A HAPPY AND CONTENT CUSTOMER
positive,18/10/21,"I sent this collection of Italian cheeses to my daughter and needless to say she was delighted. They were excellent!! <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000C0248E"">Formaggio del Cucina (Italian Cooking Cheeses  2 pound) by igourmet.com</a>"
negative,15/6/21,"This blend is bitter and does taste earthly  like drinking mud?  Really, it is the Wake Up blend is much better"
positive,4/8/21,"This is one of my favorite kinds of coffee for my Keurig. It has a nice dark taste that is not overpowering while still being strong. My mother hates strong coffee and when she comes to my house she will resuse one of these K-Cups after I've made mine to knock the punch out. Whatever your pleasure, I guess!"
positive,8/6/21,"For those of you who drink coffee black, i think you are going to love this blend of coffee. It is very delicious and has a great bold flavor."
positive,15/6/21,i love tazo teas i dont really like friuty ones but this one is okay it is tart so i have to over sweeten it its not one ove my favs
positive,4/8/21,"I like this and will order again.  Just a little spice and sweetness.  The corn flakes are actually fried, so they remind me of a thin corn chip rather than breakfast cereal."
positive,25/9/21,The whole family (even those who are not GF) loves the flavor of this mac & cheese.  Tastes like the Kraft velveeta cheese & shells. We made the recipe on the box which was yummy.
positive,19/10/21,"I love popcorn.  We have popcorn about 4 nights a week. I started out looking for popcorn on the cob as I had that this year and it was lovely, and then stumbled upon India Tree.  It's the closest that I can find to the dried on the cob popcorn and I love it. It is so fresh and natural tasting.  I've been using it for several months and ran out the other day and had to use a popular store brand.  Though the kernals popped up larger, the taste was stale and processed...not to mention, the India Tree popcorn is actually cheaper than the store brand.  I'm placing my order for more India Tree right now!"
positive,4/9/21,"Although a little crumbly, these are very tasty for a rice cake. I would definately get them again. Simple taste, but sweet enough to stave off an after lunch craving."
positive,31/8/21,"This rice is delicious, vegetarian and easy to make. I usually add some extra vegetables to it, but other than that, it's perfect just as it is.<br /><br />* Calories 200 (1 cup/145g) (2 servings per pouch)<br />* Total Fat 2.5g (no saturated or trans fat)<br />* Cholesterol 0mg<br />* Sodium 830mg<br />* Potassium 125mg<br />* Total Carbs 41g (Fiber 1g) (Sugar 1g)<br />* Protein 4g"
positive,9/10/21,Very fresh tasting and refreshing.<br />Better than any other brand I have tried.<br />A good buy if you get it delivered on a regular basis.<br />Short reviews not wanted by Amazon.
positive,15/6/21,"After trying many different brands and being totally disappointed, I reluctantly tried Taste Nirvana.  It tasted great.  Refreshing, not too sweet and mildly nutty, coconut flavor.  Signed up for monthly delivery - that says it all."
negative,4/8/21,"If you like vanilla, you will love this. I am not a big fan of vanilla, and this literally tastes like I am eating the melted vanilla ice cream out of a bowl. Much too sweet for me."
positive,15/6/21,My husband loves these. They are easy to make and yield consistent results. Easy to customize the strength by just using more or less water. We bring a few packets when we go away on weekend trips. Buying in bulk here is definitely cheaper than buying at the store. Cheers!
positive,4/8/21,"As we sample many flavors of k-cups from Amazon.com, a few stand out and Timothy's World Coffee, Italian Blend stood out. It has a fantastic flavor. Rich and delicious. I recommended it to one of my co-workers and they enjoyed it as well. This will be one of my stock items from now on."
positive,15/6/21,"I'll admit on the advice of my trainer I was not excited about adding protein shakes to my daily regiment. I was pleasingly surprised by the taste though. It's difficult to get the powder to dissolve in water but mixing it with soy milk and shaking it up did well for me. It also fills me up for a time between meals while providing me the protein I was lacking."
positive,4/8/21,"I'm glad I bought these before the price rose from $14.78 to $24.82.  They're good, but not worthy of such a large price hike. If the cost returns to a reasonable value I'll consider buying them again."
positive,1/10/21,"Took a chance on this peanut butter because it was a great price.  Turns out it's also great tasting too.  And I used it to make cookies, loved the smoothe texture, no separation and definitely lots of peanuts."
positive,1/7/18,"I purchased this to use on my hair and it has done wonders for my hair. I purchased other brands after I purchased this brand and by far it's the best. I also eat a teaspoon of this everyday and it taste so yummy. If you are looking for coconut oil that tastes great and works wonders for your hair all at a good price, then this is the one for you. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />I just received my second order of Vitacost coconut oil. I love this stuff. I now use it for stir frying veggies, frying up burgers, i even fried chicken with this oil and it came out great. This brand by far beats all the other brands on the market in value and taste. And if you suffer from dry skin especially during the cold winter months, just whip this with some shea butter and apply to your skin. Your skin will thank you for it"
positive,10/8/18,"It's great for making popcorn in my Stir Crazy popper.<br />We bought it because it's suppose to be really good for you.<br />I'll let you know in 50 years if it made me live longer."
positive,1/7/18,"I bought this green tea because it is organic. I knew I was getting a healthy product but what I got was much more. The taste is really good. It is fresh, smooth and full bodied. You will be pleased with this high quality tea. What a nice surprise. Note: This Bigelow product comes 40 bags to a box and 4 tea bags to a wrapper."
positive,10/8/18,"This tastes great, I love it in my coffee, and have even used it for pancakes.  It really doesn't give me a spike in blood sugar, as promised.  The only negative is the packaging they are using.  During shipping, some of the seals underneath the lids came off, and the bottles leaked.  I probably lost about a tablespoon (each) from 3 of the 6 bottles.  The lids don't really fit the bottles, either.  They have a pop-top, but if you use it, the syrup sometimes leakes out from under the lid where it attaches to the bottle.  If they could fix the bottles, this would definitely be a five-star product.<br /><br />**Update**  The product was not available for a few months, and when it came back--NEW PACKAGING!!  My last shipment was sealed up tight.  Five Stars for sure, but Amazon won't let me change that part."
positive,13/9/18,"I think this is a great tasting product,use in coffee every day.I am saying goo-bye to white sugar!!"
positive,17/7/18,"I have been using this for a year now, very good in tea, I use it on anything. My son puts it on his cereal, he is a very picky eater and he has no clue it isn't real sugar. I put it on my pancakes....Yuuuuummyyyy"
positive,16/1/19,"This is the second best bar I've ever had, just after Labrada's Cinnamon Bun Cookie Roll. Perfect for hiking as it stays soft and delicious when it's cold out and doesn't melt in the sun. Love these things."
negative,16/1/18,I had expected the peach tea to taste like peach and it does not.  Very disappointed.
positive,16/1/19,"I love Earth's best foods and this was a price I couldn't pass up. My infant loves this combo :)"
positive,1/8/20,"A bit sweet for my son, but if your baby has a sweet tooth, this is for you!"
positive,1/7/18,"We have purchased this on Amazon and had it shipped to our son's dorm room in college.  A great way to send snacks--spend over $25 and shipping is free!"
positive,10/8/18,"I found this once in a store but they don't carry it any more. I am so thankful that Amazon.com carrys it. My son says it's his favorite meal."
positive,15/2/20,I order this for my office and everyone loves it. I think its a great low cal alternative to chips and such.
positive,22/4/21,"More of a cross between a cracker and a cookie. I love these! They have a very distinct flavor that both my wife and I enjoy, as well as the kids. Trust me, to find a snack that everyone likes in our family is no small task! But we are very happy with the Newtons Fruit Thins Fig and Honey, and look forward to trying other flavors."
positive,25/9/20,THESE FRUIT THINS ARE VERY TASTY.  THEY ARE LOADED WITH FIGS WHICH ARE LOADED WITH VITAMIN B 6.  THEY ARE ALSO NOT NAUSIATINGLY OVER SWEETENED WHICH IS GREAT FOR US DIABETICS.  I REALLY LIKED THESE COOKIES AND PLAN TO BUY THEM AGAIN.
positive,16/11/19,"This newton product is a good adaptation of a cracker. The fruit is in the product but, it is thin and chewy! My 3 year old enjoyed it also.I would highly recommend it for adults, youth, and children. The idea of making this type of change shows creativity and ingenuity with such a wonderful brand."
positive,9/9/20,"These treats were surprisingly tasty and filling.  140 calories per serving (3 cookies).  But the cookies were really the perfect size for a light snack. These had more of a gingerbread taste than a honey taste, but that isn't a bad thing.  Allergy alert:  contains soy product."
positive,1/7/18,"at first, i thought i wouldn't like these.  i like fig newtons but i don't love them.  however, i couldn't be more pleased.  first of all, my first bite tasted like an oatmeal cookie.  i immediately checked the ingredients and yep, there's oats in there !  absolutely delicious.<br />there are bits and pieces of fig scattered throughout the cookie or thin but it's not like a spread.  now i am not sure if  it's supposed to be spread between 2 thins but its like spots of fig here and there and the fig is kinda hard and chewy but fortunately or unfortunatley, there is very little fig so it's not that big of a deal.  i couldn't taste the honey but that's ok. i absolutely love oatmeal cookies and it tasted like that.  they are a nice size and crisp.  i dunked them in my tea and they were delicious.  my hubby hates fig and i slipped these in his lunch and he loved them too.  he didn't even taste the fig.<br />these are very good however, if you really really want to taste fig, get the regular fig newtons."
positive,10/8/18,"These are good but I think I was spoiled by the Blueberry flavor.  They are my favorite.  I like the whole line because they use better quality ingredients.<br />These are delicious but I'd like more figs."
positive,15/1/20,"I have been a david seeds fan since I was a kid, I didnt think anyone could beat their seeds. Since trying Bigs seeds Buffalo wing I now have a new favorite. The seeds are a little spicy but you can eat a whole bag wihout it leaving your tongue raw.<br />I have tried all the flavors but Buffalo wing is my favorite.  Try them you will be surprised. I am not a young kid I have 45 years of sunflower seed eating experience."
positive,1/9/20,"Would have given it five stars, but the product needs to be 1 inch away from perfection for that to happen.<br /><br />All in all, it does what I needed it to do, and in spectacular fashion."
positive,22/7/21,Of the Plum tots pouches I have had this is by far the best tasting. These are a little pricey but when they are on sale they are worth every penny. Great for throwing in a diaper bag or purse.
positive,1/7/18,"I discovered these when my daughter was about 15 months old.  I wish I had found them earlier.  They are organic, taste great, are easy for toddlers to handle and very convenient!  I always keep some in my purse and in the car when we're out and about.  They are not messy, unless of course they decide to squeeze the pouch, which only happens for us when she's not hungry.<br /><br />The Plum Organics line also includes some varieties with fruits and vegetables mixed together.  They taste surprisingly good and are one way to get my picky eater to eat some veggies.  You can find some varieties at reasonable prices on Amazon, others are more expensive for some reason.  Babies R Us has had a sale every other month or so where you can get them for $1 each if you buy them in sets of 8.  That is usually when I stock up for the next two months. :)"
positive,10/8/18,"I am a very satisfied customer in which, will<br />purchase again. I couldn't receive them fast enough.<br /><br />Thank You,"
positive,14/5/21,"I am pretty happy with this product.  It has a good taste, the peanut is clear and not burnt, and like the low sodium in it.  I don't miss sugar in it, pulling all that other stuff out brings the peanut flavor forward.  My one negative is that it's not as silky as I'd like, maybe just a tad too low on oil."
positive,17/10/19,"Bars tasted good, were fresh, and I am pooping better! I would recommend this product to anyone. And they are cheap!"
positive,3/10/21,"I don't know why other people are complaining about the taste.  I mixed it with almond milk and really liked it.  Maybe the flavors go well together.  In any case, it tastes a lot like every other protein powder I've tried, except without the disgusting synthetic sweetness."
positive,15/9/20,"These snacks are SO fresh and tasty, I have never had any snacks that are fresher than these.  After trying the first bag of Mareblue snacks, they became our favorites for everyone in the family.  They are not very sweet, but just right for our taste.<br /><br />Thank Goodness for Mareblue!  Now we have a great snack that is healthy and tasty."
positive,30/8/20,This item was purchased as a gift and my step-dad really enjoyed them. The package was large and substantial so it really felt like he was getting a good gift. I was pleased with the company and had a smooth transaction. I would purchase from again!
positive,1/7/18,"This product tastes just like peanut butter, so a great alternative for those with a peanut allergy or for children who attend ""peanut free"" schools.  My granddaughter could not taste the difference.  We all use this product now and love it."
positive,10/8/18,"I have a home daycare and have a child allergic to nuts. I ordered this because we couldn't fool the kids with our local alternative (Sunbutter). I had two toddlers that would go without before they would eat sunbutter because they could tell it wasn't peanut butter. I ordered this without putting much hope into it as I've tried several and could never trick the pickiest kiddos. I was pleasantly suprized when I served this and not a one kid could tell it wasn't the real thing. I'm glad I ordered such a large quantity. I will be using this from now one. It is by far the best alternative out there.  A HUGE bonus is the fact that there aren't a bunch of additives.  Anything that uses Cane Sugar and Sea Salt always sit better with me anyway. Great product!"
positive,5/12/19,"Good stuff if you are allergic to peanut butter, tastes the same to me but I am not that picky, although it did give me the same heartburn as peanut butter so I stopped using it, it may be that I cannot digest high fat foods of this type not the product itself."
positive,21/10/19,Very good maple syrup!  I use it daily in place of sugar.  The no-drip spout is very nice.
positive,8/9/20,"Thank you King Arthur for this wonderful mix!!! I enjoy baking, however after being diagnosed with Celiac disease last year, it kind of took the fun out of baking for me. But with this mix...the baker is BACK! ;-) These cookies are exceptional!!! My gluten consuming friends couldn't tell the difference!! Can't wait to try the other products!! Please keep developing more new gluten free mixes!"
positive,22/9/21,"this cereal packs a flavorful punch. the blueberry oat clusters are divine. i only wish it had less sugar, but even then its not at all overly sweet."
positive,2/10/20,This is what you need to make your gumbo taste the way it should. It is difficult to find in stores and I was happy to be able to get it from Amazon.
positive,25/7/20,"This is the best salad dressing I've ever had. It really does taste like bruschetta, and since it's oil-based instead of cream, it's way healthier. Five stars!"
positive,4/7/21,"Seems to get rid of stomach acid coming up my throat. forgot what that's called. May just be the placebo effect.<br /><br />I put a tea bag in a 20 oz container with reverse osmosis water before I go to bed. I then drink it in the morning with my breakfast."
positive,11/9/21,"I love this tea, It has flavor, and zaz.<br /><br />you should try it."
positive,4/7/21,"I grew up on this juice in England. The lemon flavor was the original. Look for the orange and black currant......mmmmmm It is great. In the USA you don't tend to find what we call 'cordials' so much. It is a economical way of getting a great tasting juice. It is so concentrated, it goes a long way. I have a soda stream (again something I grew up with in the UK) and I make a lot of club soda with it. I then add a small amount of Barley water and it is so refreshing.<br />I love it !!!"
positive,21/9/21,"I was never a pop tart fan, but on a lark and due to the coupon, I tried these. I was pleasantly surprised at how good they tasted. I would prefer more filling as you can barely taste it. The frosting is very light and adds a perfect sweetness. One package w/ coffee is a perfect quick breakfast. Since AMZ is now out of stock for this flavor, I ordered the apple frosted ones.I think the unfrosted might be too flavorless for me."
positive,11/9/21,"I have always been pretty picky about my poptarts, so I wasn't sure if these were going to taste like cardboard or not when I first got them.  They are great poptarts.  My kids love them."
positive,12/10/21,"We love Pop Tarts (the name brand ones) but wanted to get away from all the chemicals, food dyes, and especially HFCS that those are loaded with. These are a great substitute!"
positive,11/10/21,"Having to ditch pop tarts for their extensive list of ingredients, including trans fat, I first bought the strawberry ones of this brand. I loved them, and bought and entire case here. Then I decided to try blueberry. Both are great, but I liked strawberry better. The only bad thing is that they have a lot of sugar (20g each)."
positive,28/9/21,I love to have soup for lunch and as a result I like to have a variety of soups available.  This soup is very good.
positive,19/10/21,"when i was first introduced to this product and business opportunity i was a little skeptical about it, but after i started drinking it i really like it i experienced good things. i didnt get any coffee jitters and crashes, plus i lost some weight like most people experience. so i decided to sign up as a representive so i can get it the products at wholesale. then as time goes i check my website and there were alot of people as my downline, then i relized that this business is really growing whether i do anything or not so i decided to purchase the bronze promotional package and i started getting on this business. my upline and leaders are a great help and im pretty much just trying to duplicate their success and its working. ive just upgraded to the silver promotional package to really get my business growing. ive made all my investment money back and some in the short time that ive been involved in og, considering that i dont do much, i just give people samples and show them the business opportunity. if you like to know more about this business give me a email at zang-xiong@hotmail.com. im more then happy to share this opportunity with anyone that is interested and looking to change their lifes."
positive,4/7/21,"I purchased this lime juice a few years ago on a trip to Florida.  Goes great with everything, especially in a bloody mary."
positive,11/9/21,"Seriously I didn't taste it but my dogs love these.  Shipping was very fast... I received them within 2 or 3 days of ordering.  Good price."
positive,12/9/21,This is excellent coffee - a bit strong - which I personally like.  Price is good enough for this quality.
positive,13/7/21,"This is a great snack. Easy to prepare in the microwave, just make sure you bring it to a boil or it has a slimey texture. Tastes way better than instant in our opinion."
positive,23/10/21,"Wanted my daughter to keep organic as much and long as possible so we tried this brand first & this veggie when she started solids.  It smells and looks bright, and from the first spoonfull (it's not so runny it won't stay on a spatula style spoon) she loved it!  This is a veggie she doesn't refuse.<br /><br />She'll eat a jar of this even after a full bottle if I let her!  No side effects noticed and I even tasted it & found it barely sweet and wholesome.<br /><br />This is a great deal and cheaper than in store; arrives bubblewrapped to death and no weird or broken jars so far."
positive,22/9/21,"It tastes pretty good. I mix it in a single-serve blender with water, chia seeds (that's been soaking in the water for 30 min), a banana, an apple and sometimes frozen mixed berries.<br /><br />Don't mix it with coconut water. I tried that and it tasted horrible.<br /><br />I bought this at first at Whole Foods but Amazon is MUCH cheaper, especially with the subscription program."
positive,4/7/21,"I love this green mix.  I mix it with almond milk, half a frozen banana and a whole pack of frozen acai and use it as a meal replacement.  Love it."
positive,11/9/21,"I honestly was scared of ordering this as some of the reviews are less than positive about the taste but seriously, it is good! If you are already a vegetarian or if veggies are a primary part of your daily diet you will have no problem with the taste, it's like eating sweet fresh grass. It is gritty but it doesn't bother me at all."
positive,8/8/21,Grove Square Cappuccino Cups were excellent. Tasted really good right from the Keurig brewer with nothing added.  wWould highly recommend.  RCCJR
positive,9/7/21,"I also bought this product and I can tell you that I received my shipment in a timely manner and it was worth it!! This cappuccino tastes delicious with no additions like milk, cream or sugar. Just brew it by itself and enjoy the perfect combination of a great cappuccino. Absolutely worth the price and I saved a ton of $$$ by not purchasing from starbuck's.."
positive,24/10/21,"this product is hard to find for us in stores in ohio, most k cups are french vanilla coffee, not cappuccino, its delicious, will buy again for sure!"
positive,4/7/21,"Wow, these k cups are so yummy and perfect if you are on the go. They don't require cream and sweetener so just brew and go! The only thing I would like better is if they were sugar free using a sugar substitute and were lower fat or fat free. They do taste yummy though and for the price, you can go wrong!"
positive,11/9/21,Looking for great coffee at a great price?  This is it. K-cups are expensive but this coffee is great tasting at a great price when purchased from Amazon
positive,24/10/21,"This may not be ""real"" cappuccino, but I am not sure I know what that is.  This tastes good and I really enjoy a cup of it, especially on these chilly mornings."
positive,22/6/21,No complaints coffee tasted good and it comes out to less that .50 a cup.<br />I personally think it is a bargain.
positive,30/7/21,"I absolutely love this cappuccino! I had my doubts, but they were proved wrong! I myself have a sweet tooth and I was worried that this product would taste too much like coffee and not enough like a cappuccino. But thankfully, I was worng and it had the right blend of both. I had 2 cups the first day I bought it! Shared it with my family, they loved it too!"
negative,10/7/21,Very disappointed in the taste ... nothing like it is described. Tastes very watery with some sugar added to it. Bummed I wasted my $$$.
positive,4/7/21,"Yummy, great tasting and very convenient.  Only drawback is you must clean your machine at least once a week to keep it from clogging, just like with hot chocolate."
positive,11/9/21,"These are the best seeds I've ever tasted.  Full of flavor.  It's hard to stop eating them!!!"
positive,20/9/21,"I bought this mix at the local grocery store and was very happy with them. Quick, easy and tasty. My boys love them!"
positive,13/10/21,This product is so easy to use/make and is delicious. Reminds me of my trip to the Holyland.
positive,2/8/21,"When I opened the package, I thought this tea smells exactly like Italian pignoli macaroons.  But, the taste is definitely ""darker"" and more bitter; perhaps I let it steep too long, or perhaps sweetener would bring out the ""cookie"" flavor more.  Whatever.  Black, it tastes pretty similar to the Republic of Tea Vanilla Almond flavor, which I also like.<br /><br />This tea seems to have bigger leaf pieces and less fannings than typical for bagged teas, BTW, so it's probably a higher grade of tea underneath the flavorings."
positive,11/6/21,"This product is a great substitute for sugar in drinks.  It doesn't have a funny aftertaste or change the taste of the drinks I put it in.  Obviously, it's a good alternative for sugar, but another reason I purchased it was because of it's benefit on teeth.  Xylitol is used in other countries (I've read) to fight tooth decay and improve oral health in adults and children alike (You must used 8-10 grams daily for this benefit).  My husband and I both use the toothpaste (also excellent) and gum.  Last week I saw a dentist on primetime TV doing a show on oral health, and he strongly recommended Xylitol for children also."
positive,2/8/21,"I recently gave up coffee & made the switch to teas.  I've tried all the usual suspects.  Lipton & other grocery blends were bitter or weak.  I purchased the loose tea leaves from Amazon at a fair price & quick shipping.  English friends suggested PJ Tips Tea, which we ordered from another online site.  Twinning's blows it away.  The Earl Grey & Irish Blend are great both on the pallet & to the nose."
positive,18/10/21,"Delicious loose earl grey tea.  I use it for making iced tea, my favorite.  Check out the Adagio IngenuiTEA brewer available here on Amazon for a great tea making setup.  My only wish is that Amazon stocked it in a bigger size.  I'm running out of ideas for things to do with all the dozens of little metal tea boxes i have around the house now.  Good for storing electronic cables, screws, poker chips, etc...<br /><br />Loose tea is much better than bagged tea... more room for the leaves to brew."
positive,23/7/21,This product is absolutely delightful. They are better than chocolate to me and one taste and you are hooked!
positive,8/7/21,"Great tasting coffee. Hard to find decaf hazelnut coffee, found this at Amazon, taste great, at a reasonable price. Tried more expenive decaf hazelnut coffee and was disappointed with the taste, didn't even taste like hazelnut, this is a full bodied hazelnut coffee"
positive,11/6/21,"I find these are a great alternative to the licorice laces we are all used to. The taste and texture seemed very similar to me. In fact, I like them better because of the lack of the artificial aftertaste. Would definitely buy again."
positive,25/6/21,"Taste is great, exactly what I needed for my cocktails. I just wish there was a way to buy only one bottle."
positive,2/8/21,I bought this for my mother who tasted the tea in a restaurant.  This is now her favorite tea.
positive,11/6/21,"wasn't expecting much from the product however it delivered a lot better taste than other products of this type that I have tried"
positive,9/7/21,"great taste, greater tasting, greats tastes, greating tasteeses, greate tastee, greatr taster, greatt tastet, greaty tastey, greati tastei, greatm tastem"
positive,22/6/21,Used this last night and we had great tasting spaghetti.  Packaging was good and it came in a reasonable time.  Good job.
positive,2/8/21,"My baby LOVES this stuff! I don't like peas, but I tried this once and it was not bad. I add cereal to make it thicker (my baby likes a paste-like consistency, always has), otherwise it is more like a medium-thick puree in consistency. I would absolutely recommend this product."
positive,11/6/21,Very tasty product...and low fat and natural. I have tried most of their flavors and like them all. Will buy again.
positive,8/7/21,"This product,though expensive along with the shipping, is the best tasting non-instant I've tasted.  Add a little vanilla and sugar and it's very drinkable.  My grandkids call it ""Magic Milk!""  The only complaint I have is that one package was received not fully sealed so I had fine powder all over."
positive,28/9/21,i purchased 2 single packs from a supermarket<br />i made them by using the provided method but i added 2 eggs (the soup base got way too thick)<br />for the other pack i did the same but added extra water (it was much better)
positive,23/8/21,"Well, first got this from grocery at a premium price. Ordered from amazon and saved some cash. Just as tasty and definitely worth it. This product was one of the contributing factors that led to getting a prime membership."
positive,1/8/21,"I haven't been able to find this in any store lately. I had some a few years ago, and it is REALLY GOOD.  This is more like coffee cake than anything else.  The swirl is a cinnamon sugar with small pecan pieces, and the bread is sort of like yellow cake.  I'm excited to find it on Amazon."
positive,16/7/21,I love the taste of this. I used it to pop my corn in. It made the popcorn all buttery. I have to deduct a star because when it gets cool it leaves that film that crisco-like shortenings do on the roof of your mouth. I hate that. And it has trans-fats.
negative,2/8/21,"I recently went on a gluten free diet.  Where this hurts the most so far is breakfast.  There is barely any flavor to this cereal.<br /><br />I picked up mine from Whole Foods, not Amazon.<br /><br />I'd rather it was fortified by vitamins and even though I'm sure it would taste worse, at least it would have taste and do me some good.  It really isn't filling.  The barely darkened milk doesn't taste chocolate, though does lose some of the good taste of the only thing with taste - the milk.  I don't know if it is the rice flavor, or the general lack of flavor, but there is a hint of staleness, I think.  Could I add sugar?  Sure, and then I'd taste the sugar or sugar substitute, but that doesn't make it more healthy.<br /><br />To be fair, it isn't bitter, or too salty, or too sweet, or sour, so there isn't anything there to offend.  If you are eating it fast enough, it won't be mush.  If it has stopped making noise, you are in danger of mushiness.  It makes some truly good snap crackle and pop noises.  I suppose the cereal is bad enough to encourage you to eat some fresh fruit to have a good taste in your mouth and remember to take a daily vitamin (I can only take those every other day).<br /><br />It is cheaper than granola.  When I can afford it, I'm totally getting outrageous gluten free granola.  I also have envirokids to try next."
negative,11/6/21,I am a HUGE Vita Coco fan. I drink it almost ever day. This flavor terrible. I cant believe that Vita Coco sells it. Stay away
negative,26/6/21,"I wish Rihanna would get her face off this product.  It tastes nasty.  I bought a couple dozen since I love Vita Coco's products. However, this flavor is just the worst. They tried, and the taste has a hint of guava.  But it doesn't work in this package.  I have tried giving them away and nobody wants them - I still haven't seen anyone who likes the taste."
positive,20/8/21,"I had never tried blackstrap molasses before and I was expecting not to like the taste after reading many online comments about how awful it tastes and how much it's an acquired taste.  I bought this from the grocery store since it was on sale, and I actually love the taste of it.  I read on another site that some people thought it tastes like licorice, but I don't think it does at all, which is good because I hate the taste of licorice.  The only thing I don't like about this is that it's really messy.  Maybe if it was in a squeeze bottle it would be easier to pour into a measuring spoon."
positive,25/8/21,"Read the ingredients on most cereal boxes then read the Kashi boxes. What a difference. You may never eat a ""regular"" cereal again. Kashi cereals taste better, eat better, and make a true cereal lover happy."
negative,19/10/21,"I love strong tasting tea and these has no taste. I feel like I'm just drinking hot water. I would not recommend it."
positive,2/8/21,I think this is the best chicken rub ever!  Very tasty and very easy to prepare.  We are huge fans of roasted chicken so I try different recipes with regularity but find I keep coming back to this one.  It is a favorite and has never let us down.
positive,11/6/21,"Bought these to try some new recipies, but have found they are quite tasty straight out of the can, chopped up in my salad!"
positive,22/10/21,"I'm not a beef stick/beef jerky eater.  These were bought for my son's school snack, however I have eaten a few and really like the beef flavor."
positive,6/8/21,"If you're looking for authentic, Thai curry, this is it.  After you've made the dish a few times, you can tailor it to your liking.  We like it VERY spicy, so we're generous with the portions, and add chili flakes and a little madras curry powder.<br /><br />Buy with confidence, and keep your pantry stocked!"
positive,24/6/21,These little fruit cups of peaches are quite scrumptious.  Being packed in apple juice is so much better than syrup and does not destroy the delicate peach flavor.  The fruit tastes freshly ripened but not mushy.  Each serving is perfect for one person and can be taken to work or where ever without a problem.  The price for each pack of 36 is good too (for now anyway).  I highly recommend these little (just 4 ounces) fruit cups.
positive,17/4/21,"I'm still not a food reviewer. The problem is that I can't turn down free coffee. That said, this is good stuff, mellow with none of the bitter edge common with a lot of the cheaper stuff sold at the local grocery store. I subtracted one star from the review because of the ridiculously pretentious ad copy on the box. Drinking this coffee won't fix the world or make your life more fulfilling, I'm fairly sure."
positive,10/3/21,"Marley Coffee One love Organic is dark, rich and flavorful with good mouth feel and a medium roundness of tone. Not bitter, but there seems to be almost a salty undertone to it, that does speak of Jamaica and Blue Mountain although the label does not claim it is Blue Mountain coffee. These packets are about one normal scoopful, and can be used in single serving coffee makers but I put one in my 2-4 cup espresso machine and it was fantastic."
positive,17/4/21,"I received my order in time.  The walnuts are very good, fresh, and delicious.  There was a slight issue with the package.  It's a plastic bag.  There were a couple of small cuts on the bag.  Since the package was left on my front porch for a few hours, some ants got into the box.  Fortunately there wasn't enough time for them to really get into the plastic bag.  Overall I'm satisfied with this purchase."
positive,21/1/21,This stuff is great to make egg dishes special.  It does add a truffle scent but you must cut down on adding other salt.
positive,30/1/21,"I'm not a coconut oil savant, but I got this for my stovetop popcorn popper and it's awesome.  It's not super-greasy, very light, cooks the popcorn to perfection and leaves an amazing hint of coconut without the sweetness (although my husband says it doesn't get the coconut hint, but he misses a lot of hints).  It shipped quickly, was well-packaged, and is a good price, I didn't want to buy a ton in case we didn't like it."
positive,13/2/21,I have been buying Garden of Life products for several years now and have tried other coconut oils but still come back to Garden of Life.  Even though it cost more than other brands it still taste the best.
positive,15/1/21,"This soup mix is so easy and tastes great! That being said, I add, 1 can of chicken breast, 1 can of white kidney beans, 1 can of stewed tomatoes and 1 1/2 cups of frozen corn. I also add another 2 cups of water so it yields much more than 6 servings and is VERY hearty!  Overall, still a great price!"
positive,6/3/21,"I never thought one salt was different from another but wow!  This salt is special.  It is very flavorful, not fishy!  It really enhances the flavor of food.  I add a little salt when I make a sweet food and it brings out the sweetness.  For example, add a little salt to the boiling water before you add the oatmeal.  Yumm!  Fantastic Salt!!!!"
positive,8/6/21,"I had tried a tahini before I bought the Kevala tahini and I didn't like it at all.Then I found the Kevala tahini on Amazon and I decided to give it a try. I love it, it's rich,creamy, organic and it tastes good. I will probably buy it again."
positive,7/1/21,"Great tasting healthy snack.  And when I say great tasting, I mean it, I am very picky about food, so it is not ""great tasting"" for super health conscious people who only eat bad tasting health bars.  And it's great to know you are getting a ton of fiber which most of us do not get enough of!"
positive,17/4/21,I like that these are all individually packages. They are great to snack on or share with other. Great flavors!
positive,10/3/21,Fast service the items arrived the next day - Our dog loves them and they make great stocking stuffers for the holidays for our dog and the neighbors.
positive,14/1/21,"My cats absolutely love all the Fancy Feast Appetizers and this is definitely a favorite flavor. They look at me with love when they see me reach for the container and that's the part I like best."
positive,24/5/21,Tastes great when you combine 1 pack of Twinings Green Tea and 1 pack of Lipton Black Tea in a hot cup of water and add 1 or more teaspoon of sugar. Make sure to remove the teabags from your cup within few minutes to avoid the strong bitter taste.
positive,14/10/21,"I like these! They are crispy and flavorful. Also, they are very colorful which any cook knows is important when preparing food for others. Place a bowl of these on the table at your next BBQ and just wait for the compliments. Read the nutrition information and compare it to your favorite potato chips and ask yourself why you would want to ingest all that junk when these chips taste just as good."
positive,7/2/21,"It was a great gift! The recipient loved it. He was happy and if he's happy, so am I. I would definitely do business w/ these folks again."
positive,29/3/21,"Tinkyada's brown rice elbow pasta is a great tasting gluten free choice. It is just like having ""normal"" pasta only better! It cooks just like any pasta, and can be used in any pasta dish. I highly recommend this product."
positive,17/4/21,I like this almond flour very much.  It is a good price and tastes great.  I appreciate the texture<br />of almond flour.
positive,10/3/21,THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE FLAVORS. THESE LOLLIPOPS HAVE NO<br />COMPETITION. GREAT FLAVORS TO CHOOSE FROM AND BEST FLAVOR IN A<br />LOLLIPOP YET.
positive,10/7/21,"This is one of the best protein bars I've tasted yet.  That it's vegan and made with more natural ingredients than most bars is a huge plus, but the main selling point is that this bar is something you actually want to eat."
positive,27/1/21,"I got a sample of this item at a food industry show and really enjoyed it. It is delicious and nutritious, a great way to start a cold morning. It is a nice touch that the pouch can be used for measuring the water."
negative,1/6/21,"Bad tasting coffee, no aroma/baked, very dry, bitter, hard, harsh and unpleasant aftertaste of burnt charcoal. Not suitable for espresso and not creamy at all."
positive,20/8/21,"I've been eating raw honey for a while now and this is among the best tasting that I've tried.  It was also reasonably priced, unlike some of the other raw honey products that give you a tiny jar for the same price (or more) than I paid for this large 3-pounder."
positive,14/8/21,"I am a jasmine tea lover.  Might Leaf Organic Spring Jasmine is so reasonably priced!  It has the taste of of a tea that make you believe it is a very expensive, exotic Chinese tea.  A cup in the afternoon is so special.  The foil bag keeps the tea fresh."
positive,21/4/21,First of all I was very surprised to get this so fast. I just ordered it yesterday and it was at my doorstep before 11 am. ( which never happens) anyway I opened it and had a serving and was shocked that it tasted pretty good. Now for those who have tried vegan drinks you know that they are not always the best tasting thing but this is definitely one of the better drinks I have had. I will be reordering this and I will now try the other flavors and hope they are as good as this one.
positive,1/4/21,"If this is as healthy as it is tasty then a great product.  A little pricey for only 15 servings, but that Organic Red Dutch Cocoa is delectable."
positive,17/4/21,"We do not grill steaks if we are out of this product - it really is THAT good. In fact, we have turned so many friends onto this after having them over for perfectly grilled meat (if you love charred outside and medium rare to medium well done - fantastic). We have tried several other flavors they have, and while they are good - this is our favorite by far!!"
positive,10/3/21,I am trying to get away from drinking diet soda so I decided to try sparking water with lemon.  I love the taste of this brand and Amazon has a great price.
positive,22/4/21,"This is a tasty flavor but not one I could drink everyday.  The honey flavor makes it a little sweet for my palette but for a dessert coffee it works wonderfully.  I won't but this for everyday repeated use but it is a good special treat flavor."
positive,25/4/21,"This is our favorite chicken seasoning sauce.  Add orange juice in a bag along with this sauce & chicken pieces and toss!  Easy and the chicken tastes better than El Polo Loco's!"
positive,1/4/21,"I really like this coffee for both the taste and the size of the cup. I can brew one cup and get a full size cup, unlike so many of the other selections that only give a small cup of coffee. In the mornings, I want a full cup of coffee to go. I don't want to full around with a small sample. Besides that, the taste suits me. We have tried lots of the others, but I have since settled on this one for my taste. Try it! I think you will agree with me."
positive,30/6/21,"This tonic water is the best! It does not contain high fructose corn syrup, so it tastes better. Buy it! You will not regret it!"
positive,1/3/21,"Wow, we've never had so much Macaroni and Cheese in a long time! And Annie's is really, really good. This doesn't need additional milk or butter, and the sauce is an easy-to-squeeze out paste in a foil package. It tastes great, and makes a great receptacle for some creativity of your own too.<br /><br />Tips to enjoy it:<br /><br />- Just boil in plenty of water, the six-cup requirement is a minimum.<br /><br />- Drain quickly, put the pasta back in the hot pot. The remaining heat is just right to melt the thick cheesy sauce into the macaroni. Don't rinse the pasta in cold water, it will make it hard for the sauce to combine well.<br /><br />- All the Deluxe versions are animal rennet free. Annie's FAQ is very specific about which ones use vegetable rennet (not all do) but Amazon isn't picking up the information. I tag the really vegetarian ones ""animal rennet-free"" whenever I can.<br /><br />- Try blending sundried tomatoes, a fresh tomato, olive oil, garlic, pizza peppers, salt, freshly ground pepper, and a touch of balsamic vinegar into a paste. This really complements the mac and cheese and gives it a new, gourmet taste that still doesn't take away from the ""mac and cheesiness"" of it.<br /><br />- Tabasco Chipotle sauce makes a great addition for the adventurous. The smoky taste is tempered by the creaminess."
positive,29/1/21,"Placed my order and shipping was fast.  The product arrived in great condition and they tasted wonderful. I recommend them to other family members who also purchased them.  After I finish my review I'm going to buy more. Great taste and great value."
positive,17/4/21,The price great. The only thing that could be better is an assortment.
positive,10/3/21,"I love these meal replacement bars. I warm one up in the microwave almost every day for breakfast. They are nutritious and delicious and keep me full all the way until lunch. I decided to go with the ""Subscribe and save"" feature and get these for a great price!"
positive,30/5/21,I have trouble finding anything like these in the stores so I was happy to find them here!  They taste great and are a very good bargain.
positive,28/9/21,"Tastes great.  Good price.  I eat them after lunch when I'm craving something sweet.  Donuts and pastries mess up your diet, but these are great to get the sugar you crave in a low calorie treat.  I get them through subscribe and save, best way to go."
positive,6/5/21,"These have GOT to be the BEST tasting gluten free cookies I have EVER tasted. I was just blown away by the taste and texture. My husband couldn't believe it was Gluten Free. I won't buy another brand. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004T348UW"">Pamelas Products 39439 Extreme Chocolate Simple Bites Gluten Free</a>"
positive,20/4/21,"These taste great. Very sweet and flavorful without the aftertaste of conventional candies. 10 lbs requires a bit of a financial investment but it's a great value if you're a ""natural"" candy lover. This comes shipped in a plastic bag so I recommend getting a plastic tub or a using an old popcorn tin for storage (2 gallon size or thereabouts)."
positive,20/4/21,"I hope I don't offend but I am not a regular visitor to Starbucks.  It is not because I don't like them but it is because I usually have my coffee at home.  Their product is actually pretty good from the few times I have been to one of their stores.  This product ranks high on my list of prepackaged coffees.  Light as I like it, but very flavorful, it is a nice way to start the day.  Don't shy away from it because it has a ""chain restaurant"" brand, it is actually pretty good."
positive,21/4/21,"Loved the depth of flavor in the vanilla flavored starbucks coffee.  I really loved that the rich coffee could still be tasted through the flavoring, the vanilla complimenting rather than overpowering.  Tastes like a true vanilla bean, not just sugary syrup.  I only wish that starbucks, and everyone else who has flavored coffee, would include nutrition facts on the side.  Not sure why coffee doesn't see to have to, but I wish they would."
positive,2/5/21,"I've had many different types of Starbucks coffee and there are very few I don't like. I don't really care for the more mild blends but this has a nice taste to it. I usually prefer a dark bold brew like French but this milder tasting coffee did not disappoint. It has a smooth subtle vanilla flavor and is a nice alternative for a change. The smell of vanilla fills the kitchen as it brews.<br /><br />It's made with Latin American beans and has natural ingredients. Bring the empty bag to Starbucks when you're done and you'll get a free coffee.<br /><br />Overall, the taste/quality i'll give 4 stars."
positive,18/12/19,"This is a product I have tried before and always have come back to.  Great aroma,flavor, and value!  Wikll buy again and again."
positive,19/1/20,"it arrived in a timely manor and in great shape... by ordering on line i saved close to $100 and couldn't be more happy"
positive,19/1/20,the gaint slim jims taste so much better if you keep them in the refrig for some reason & make great snacks on the run...
positive,31/3/20,"I enjoy slimJim Tabasco, for the spicy taste and a quick fix for something simple and on the go.With any kind of cheese brings out more spice. Zion"
negative,18/12/19,"It contains too much fat and when you bite it than you can feel the fat in your mouth, it's disgusting."
positive,13/10/19,"My husband love monster slim jims. Alot cheaper to buy it by packs then pieces. He ate 2 packs in a month, he is something but anyways I do recommend this to everyone. Great price for great products."
positive,28/9/20,"It is a flavorful snack that provides enough flavor but isn't too salty nor that boring of a snack. It's a pretty good alternative to potato chips or any other snack product."
positive,16/11/20,"Organic green tea, with absolutely fantastic aroma is hard to find. This is a great example of a great tea. The leaves are very large when they open up, which is how the tea is supposed to be. Aroma is not overwhelming, great!!!! Will buy again and again!"
positive,27/2/20,"Have been using this bean to make the morning mocha's for about 6 months, its a good quality bean.  Makes a nice dark flavorful espresso with good crema. Highly recommended."
positive,26/2/21,"I do Bikram Yoga almost every day and this is by far the best rehydrating drink I have had. It's so refreshing and one of these after class cures my thirst."
positive,18/12/19,"This quick bread is really easy to make even though it does require extras to be added.....2 eggs and 1/2 cup of melted butter and water.  It cooks up fast and easy and tastes great.  It's a bit on the heavy side...sort of like pound cake with very few poppy seeds but it's truly enjoyable.  I would recommend it for an occassional treat but a lot of butter is used so I wouldn't suggest daily intake of it.  Give it a try, I think you will enjoy it too."
positive,19/1/20,"I don't have time for much shopping, and finding any sassafras drink is nearly impossible for me. Ordering this from Amazon saves me time and and gas money. It tastes good too. I mix it into a Mr. Beer bottle, then carbonate it with the Fizz-Giz Soda Maker. In this manor I am controlling what the sweetener is and how much I use. The sweetener that you use will make a big difference taste."
positive,13/9/20,"I was looking for all natural flavored coffee (not easy to find) when my college aged son brought some of this home. I could not find it locally at grocery stores or Starbucks locations so I'm glad it's available at amazon. It has a mild vanilla flavor- not overwhelming like some of the artificially flavored coffees. I will continue to order it."
positive,10/7/20,"I tried a pack randomly today at Starbucks.  I wanted something different from the banana bread or chocolate-covered graham crackers that I would otherwise buy.  This is some solid trail mix.  I highly recommend.  As a matter of fact, I am on amazon now to buy more of it so I can let friends try."
negative,14/4/21,"Thought I'd give these a try because I was looking for an afternoon slightly sweet snack bar that's high in protein, low-fat and great tasting.  Well these are high in protein(which I like), are low in fat(which I like), but I think in their processing to make it low-fat they compromised on the flavor. I was expecting a more natural peanut butter taste but was disappointed with the texture and taste. Artificial!!  I will not buy these again.  I'm stuck now with the whole box. My hunt continues for that great snack bar."
positive,24/4/21,"I love this tea! My wife is usually the big tea drinker in the house but after trying this in my Keurig I have to say I LOVE it. I didn't purchase through amazon though because I got the same amount 24 in a box for only 9.99 elsewhere but I would recommend it to anyone."
positive,28/4/21,"Great tea for the Keurig.  We love it!  Now for a good cocoa and apple cider.(Don't get the Green Mountain cider)"
positive,12/7/21,"Great Keurig tea pods.  This is not chai latte, so don't expect white milky beverages.  This is just tea flavored with chai spices.  I suppose if you add hot milk you could make a decent chai latte though, but I haven't tried it yet.  Very bright flavors, but not overpowering."
positive,18/12/19,"I really wanted to get a chocolate syrup for my sons to make chocolate milk with but hated buying hersheys because of the HFCS and other ingredients. Being in Alaska options were zero. So I ordered this off amazon in a 4 pack to save money hoping it was good and it is! We keep ours in the fridge, so maybe that's why, but it takes a few extra stirs to get it mixed well. But the flavor is great and I can rest at ease knowing (even though it's still sugary) at least it is organic and natural."
positive,19/1/20,"This is the greatest chocolate sauce I have ever tried.  It beats gourmet sauces, dairy sauces and any other form I have used in my life.  And the best part is that it is vegan and contains no nasty chemicals.  Its only problem is that it is seriously addicting to the basic chocoholic!"
positive,28/4/21,I love these Splenda options and I truly dislike every other sweetener on the market.  Totally Light has mixed in Splenda perfectly (unlike some diet sodas I will not call out by name...).  This read tea peach is very light and refreshing and definitely makes drinking water much more enjoyable!
positive,8/8/20,"If you are a lover of dark chocolate, marzipan, and ginger this product is the sublime combination the the three."
positive,22/5/21,The taste of these teas are great. but i added honey to make it a little more sweet.
positive,18/12/19,"Thankfully it is getting easier to find great tasting gluten free products. we have two members of our family who can't eat gluten due to medical issues so we have to shop with that in mind. Many gluten-free offerings taste dodgy or ""off"" but this product is an exception. We had this for dinner last night and it was great. We served it with shrimp and tomato sauce and everyone loved it. We will definitely get this brand again next time we have a chance."
positive,19/1/20,"My son loves these for self feeding and it's a good snack on the road, in the car or whenever you go to a restuarant and need to keep them busy. My son loves them, and even I do!"
positive,3/8/20,"This is better than chocolate!!I mix it along with stevia in yogurt, cottage cheese, almond butter...whatever I think of.  Also, makes awesome brownies."
positive,29/7/21,These work great in reducing nausea for my pregnant wife. Much better than preggie pops. These also taste good. I would buy again.
positive,8/7/20,I love this product! I have been taking wheatgrass for over a year and this is by far my favorite way to take it. Many of the other flavors are good too but this one mixes so easily with just milk. I also add this to protein shakes for a quick and easy way to get a helping of wheatgrass. I have found that it is best to first mix with a little water as it helps the wheatgrass mix better.
positive,13/4/21,The stuff takes a lot of stirring to get it dissolved.Then drink it quickly before it starts to settle on the bottom.
positive,20/2/21,I normally buy the original green superfoods but the chocolate is quite tasty. I mixed it with Vanilla Almond Milk. It mixes well enough although you do still get a bit of grittiness. I never tried it with just water or milk so I cannot really testify to its taste with those liquids. If you like chocolate...nice choice.
positive,9/12/20,"I enjoyed this tea just plain, without honey or sugar.  It was tasty and refreshing.  It was good hot and cold.  Very mild and much tastier than just plain green tea.  I would definitely recommend this."
positive,1/4/21,"I like this tea. It's one of the better green teas I have tasted. It has a smooth and subtle flavor. I definitely enjoy it more than Bigelow's green tea, and it compares favorably to other brands as well. The packaging is also very elegant. I don't really have much more to say about this tea. Try it, you might like it."
positive,25/2/21,"This salt works great in my grinder and is yummy. I had no problems with the package; all the salt was contained. A great price for the amount of salt. I'm quite pleased."
positive,18/12/19,"Haven't bought these from Amazon, but I do buy them from Trader Joes. These cherries are VERY good and the best part is that there is no sugar or other sweetener added (which is pretty hard to find). The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because some of the cherries are too dry and not that tasty, but the majority of the bag is delicious."
positive,19/1/20,This is item is on my regular grocery list.<br /><br />They have a good texture and are tasty.<br /><br />I only wish they were organic.
positive,14/10/20,"I've tried many of the MTR ready to eat meals and this is one of the tastiest. I will buy again."
positive,10/3/21,This salt makes anything better.  My burgers take on a wonderful flavor.  I buy more than one at a time so I can share with friends.  The grocery does not stock this item all the time so ordering is the best way to get it.  I always have a bottle on hand.
positive,15/8/21,"This tastes great on bar-b-qued food; it adds more bar-b-que taste. It is absolutely fabulous on grilled salmon. In winter, I use a cast iron skillet for the salmon and it adds a great outdoor taste to it."
positive,27/4/21,I was expecting a plain old cup of coffee when I popped this into the Keurig; Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be a party in my mouth.  This coffee was delicious.  I will definitely buy this again.
positive,24/1/21,"We've tried a lot of coffee cups and I find this one the best tasting.  I hit the ""biggest"" cup button and the coffee still has a lot of flavor for me."
positive,14/7/20,Very good tasty.It is a great feeling to have it while i am watching the Crayon Shin-chan. And I think someone will share my feeling.
positive,5/6/21,"I like Lance products but I wasn't sure how these would be received. Both kids loved them, they have a good texture and taste. Great change from chewy granola bars or cookies. Lance packs these with a small stiff liner so they generally survive in the lunch box without shattering. Definitely buying again."
positive,9/7/21,Product was received from vendor quickly.  It is the best tasting non calorie juice around.  So glad to be able to get it here.  thanks
positive,5/6/21,"Real Food Organic Corn Thins are great tasting !<br />They go perfect with ""Let's Do Lunch's healthy eating<br />program. Their are so many ways to eat them. I like them plain<br />or with honey spread on them for a snack. Melt low fat cheese on them ,<br />then add a slice of fresh tomato and basil. I put them in the food processor or Ninja and make flour out of them.The flour makes great pancakes! There is endless ways to use them. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKXJW0"">Real Foods Organic Corn Thins, Original Flavor, 5.3-Ounce Bag (Pack of 12)</a>"
positive,25/7/21,"This Healthy Request version of Chunky Chicken Noodle is delicious. It tastes the same as the regular version, which isn't true of all of the varities of Healthy Request soup.<br /><br /> Before I start to warm the soup. I add a package of Ramen noodles, without the flavoring packet. The Ramen noodles absorb the chicken flavor of the liquid for a great taste. And makes for an inexpensive, and filling, complete meal that is quick and easy to prepare. With much less salt than the regular version."
positive,13/7/21,"No gluten free diets here, but I buy it and make it fat free by substituting apple sauce for butter, sweetener for sugar, skim milk for buttermilk and extra egg whites for eggs.  I know, sounds dreadful, but it tastes suprisingly good.  The best mix I've tried for the fat free adaptation."
positive,9/7/21,I love this!  I have made it for cornbread and also to use as breadcrumbs for cornbread dressing.  It is great to have cornbread again since being diagnosed with Celiac.
positive,8/7/21,"Those who label this as weak and  tasteless must be used to drinking straight espresso because this is very good tasting coffee and not weak at all. Although sometimes I question amazon reviews generally...<br /><br />This is a delicious cup of coffee not to strong not too weak (I tend to lean towards strong coffee personally). I do have 1 complaint though, It did not seem to brew a larger cup than that of my other t discs, I really doubt if that is 12 ounces.<br /><br />That being said I prefer this to my Starbucks blend t discs. Starbucks is a slight bitter in comparison, this is richer and a perfect middle ground between dark and light brew with terrific flavor!"
positive,15/7/21,"If these are as nutritious as they are tasty, it's a fabulous alternative to real apples. These are NOT the fully-dried apples you may have had. They are partially dehydrated, with a nice chewy texture. They are a little tart, but I'm not sure if that is the apples or the sulfur dioxide. It's a pleasant tart, in any event. Hope sulfur dioxide isn't a dangerous ingredient, as it's all there is except apples.<br />Quality of the source fruit is excellent - no core, seeds, skin or other ""bad"" bites.<br /><br />I should also mention that this is a rather large serving.<br />I snack on these in my office, and one bag serves as about four 120-calorie snacks for me.<br />So it's a much better buy than it might appear."
positive,6/7/21,"This company has the best quality tasting baby food so I buy them all even though the packaging is kind of messy to scoop out of. This flavor is my little ones favorite and it is made of healthy quality ingredients. I've tasted all of their foods and understand why my little one gobbles this right down and spits out other baby food."
positive,13/8/21,"I live in a major metrpolitan area and have a vacation home in Florida.  The Florida home is in a city that does not have a<br />craft coffee shop.  I do not count Starbucks as a craft coffee shop.  I puchased an espresso machine for Florida and I am using<br />the Lavazza pods to make espresso and coffee drinks using espresso.  The results are outstanding.  The espresso is bold,<br />smooth and flavorful.  Best of all little to no cleanup.  Just toss the used pod in the garbage and you are done.  I buy<br />the box of 150, and the cost is about 35 cents per pod."
positive,5/6/21,"My entire family of 6 love this popcorn.  We're all big popcorn lovers...and are very picky!  We've converted to this brand.  My only complaint is that now we go through popcorn twice as fast!"
positive,9/7/21,"My mom loved iced coffee.  Living in Sacramento, hot coffee just isn't appealing when its 110 outside.  But you want your coffee fix.  So, she brewed up a whole pot of coffee using the 60s version of the coffee maker, the percolator coffee maker.  The coffee wasn't that good, but you could make a lot of it, and then refrigerate it, pour it over ice, and sweeten and cream it to taste.  Yumm!<br /><br />Starbucks makes it easier.  You just purchase the Frappuccino Mocha, pop it into the refrigerator, let it cool down, pour it over ice, and you have delicious iced coffee, sweetened and creamed just how I like it.<br /><br />What's not to like?  It is expensive.  But I suppose when you add in the cost of the half-n-half, the coffee, the sugar, and the time to make it, it's not that bad.  It's really more of an indulgence than a necessity.  I like to have a couple of bottles in the 'fridge during the summer, for those times when I want something cold to drink, but don't want to have a soft drink.  Iced coffee sometimes is just what you want.<br /><br />Moderately Highly Recommended.  Five stars for taste, five stars for the convenience, three stars for the price.  Over-all, a winner."
positive,17/6/21,"I am an experienced cook but new to Indian, so this spice box was the best way for me to jump in and test the waters.  This was out of stock at the time I wanted it, so I contacted the Ajanta site directly and spoke to the owner and author of the accompanying cookbook (who signed my book) at their west coast CA restaurant--and it was shipped promptly the next day and I rec'd it two days later...mind you, I am on the east coast, in NY. I couldn't have been more pleased with the speedy delivery.  I was impressed with the spice box too.  Everything was in its place, and the top of the lid is 'mapped' out in alphabetical order, just like a box of chocolates, so you can quickly find the specific spice you want--a veritable file cabinet of spices.  Someone else mentioned that theirs arrived all jumbled up, so I have to assume that it got that way in shipping.  Mine was pristine and thoroughly organized, with a gold sticker sealing it down, lovely enough to 'gift.'  Having all spices in front of you to see, touch, and smell is easier to learn about too, better than just seeing illustrations in a book.  All in all, as a beginner of Indian cooking, this was an economical and practical way to try almost 100% of the necessary spices needed for ANY cookbook of Indian cuisine. I highly recommend it."
positive,31/8/21,"I was looking for a light cookie/biscuit to have with tea in the afternoons that was low in calorie and sugar.  I naturally went to Sprouts (formerly Henry's) looking for this first since they have all the natural items.  I picked these up to try thinking that I liked the taste of honey gram plus they were 100% percent natural and 14 pieces has just 130 calories.  All criteria's were met.  Later that night when I had them with tea I also loved the flavor.  I'll be a regular buyer now."
positive,7/8/21,"Since being put on a low-sodium diet, this has been the best seasoning I've found!  It adds lots of flavor and has NO sodium.  Hurray!  I love it in rice, grits and potatoes."
positive,6/9/21,"Arrived on time, perfectly DRY roasted, just like I love 'em. No nasty, oily residue everywhere.  Nutty and sweet as one would expect Cashews to be.  Great product."
positive,5/6/21,"I first tried this tea when my local grocery store had it at Christmas time. I went back and bought a ton of it because it immediately became my favorite tea. I love the peppermint & ginger and I love the fresh new bud taste of white tea, over green tea leaves (Same plant, different part). This tea has it all. Mildly spicy, and smooth yet refreshing. I practically live on herbal teas and have tried lots of different ones. This is my number one all time favorite!"
positive,9/7/21,Good herbal tea. Seemingly air tight individual packages lock in freshness. You can really taste the peppermint oil but not in an overbearing way. I am happy.
positive,19/6/21,We enjoy the flavor of this tea.  We use it for hot tea and ice tea.  Using a regular teabag and this pumpkin spice tea mix good ice tea.<br /><br />It is good for the holiday season.
positive,5/9/21,"My husband and I are coffee and tea freaks!  We'll try just about anything once.  I really like this tea, even if it's not Christmas.  Very smooth, the mint finish is very nice.  The ginger note is subdued, and not overpowering as I thought it might be.  Well worth trying at least once."
positive,10/10/21,"Very nice mild taste, doesn't have any burned or bitter taste like most of dark roasts"
positive,29/9/21,"I normally drink half-caff and am very pleased with it, but after trying a sample of the Tully's French Roast decaf that came in a variety pack, I was truly AMAZED at the flavor.  I anticipated it being bland, not much taste but I was sooo wrong.  The flavor is so rich and robust that a couple times I checked the box to confirm it was actually decaffinated! Although I will continue to drink the half-caf, this product has taken the #1 spot on my coffee list!"
positive,11/9/21,"Got for my fiance and she loves the taste, and the half calf is much easier for her to handle than a full caff, and it doesn't make her fall back to sleep like the decaf does.<br /><br />Before switching to half caff she was drinking Dark Magic, so if you want so switch to half caff from that, this might be a good one to try."
positive,5/6/21,This coffee tastes so good we have completely given up going out for coffee.  Love the ease of the product and Amazons fast shipping with Prime
positive,9/7/21,"This is going to be a staple in my house from now on- good flavor, less jitters, makes a great 'anytime' coffee. Decaf can be so uninspiring.<br /><br />I wish they would make flavored half caf....are you listening, Green Mountain.."
positive,26/8/21,"When we got our Keurig coffee-maker, I was excited to try new coffees.  Most are way too strong for me.  I do like flavor, but way too often the K-cups are more bold than I like.  This Caramel Drizzle has just the right combination of coffee and caramel and makes for a nice rich but smooth cup of coffee."
positive,26/7/21,This rice blend is very tasty and has nice chewy bits in it from the addition of the barley and rye berries.  I greatly enjoy it.
positive,11/9/21,"I've been trying with limited amounts of success to eat vegan and low-gi. Amys soups are excellent for this, they make it very easy to lose weight. One limiting factor is fat cravings, eating vegan it's actually hard to get enough fat.<br /><br />This is a long way of saying this soup tastes great, I can tell it's oily and i love that about it. I need fat in my diet or I'll lose my mind and eat a whole pizza. Low-fat diets are a travesty anyway, creating a market for high-sugar high-gi products labeled as ""healthy""<br /><br />So this soup brings oil and mushrooms and a very good flavor. I've had about a dozen types of amys soups, and this is at the top with golden lentil, no chicken noodle, and trader joes lentil vegetable (made by amys)."
positive,11/9/21,I would have given this a 5 star but the container was not completely sealed. I took off the cap and the seal was partially lifted up. I have used it several times and the flavor is great.
positive,15/9/21,This brand has a wide variety of flavors.  This makes a great gift or when you want to satisfy your sweet tooth.
positive,5/6/21,I just love the taste of this tea. The weird thing is it cuts your craving for sweets. I drank it in the morning and before bed and lost 20 lbs.
positive,9/7/21,"I don't know if it really promoted weight loss, but it tastes great and is perfect on cold winter days. I will say that if I drank it late in the afternoon I felt like I had trouble getting to sleep, but that may be in my head."
positive,14/9/21,"Mixed with ice water, this has a great taste.  For those of you having grown up in Europe, the taste will bring back memories."
positive,29/9/21,"these are a very hard to come by item, very tasty but not too strong. Recieved them very quickly for an international order"
positive,10/7/21,Purchased my first Keurig brewer after using a regular machine.<br />Quick and easy in the morning and the Emeril coffee tastes great.
positive,1/3/20,This coffee is not to strong but strong enough and has great flavor.  We love it.
positive,28/7/20,"I love a very strong coffee, but dislike any trace of bitterness. This coffee has a very delicious, smooth flavor. I highly recommend for any true coffee lover."
positive,28/7/20,"i love this butter. it's better than regular butter and makes eggs or anything else taste great. Plus it's organic with higher levels of Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA). A must in every home, i think"
positive,10/11/19,"The package doesn't lie: these are BIG bars! They are also very dense, and as a result are very filling. They're very chewy, so if you've got jaw problems you might wanna skip these. That's the only thing I didn't like about them. That being said, they have a great peanut flavor and I enjoyed the layer of peanut butter on the bottom. I think the peanut butter makes the bar. Overall, a very tasty snack and a nice, large bar."
positive,1/3/20,"I'm not sure that these bars are really all that different from a candy bar -- they're pretty sweet and not exactly low-calorie. However, they are quite tasty."
positive,3/8/19,Dark Chocolate cookies taste great!  I have just tried the peanut butter and those are good too.
positive,6/2/21,"These are quite good tasting!  Even though you have to buy several boxes rather than just one at a time, the individual boxes are manageable enough for use over a period of time.  It would be nice, as with most things, if they were a bit less expensive and also didn't have to be bought 'in bulk,' but overall they're very good especially compared to some other 'organic' offerings."
positive,24/2/21,"These cookies are really good, you wouldn't even know they are gluten free if you didn't read the package. My only complaint is the size is a little small for the money althogh the individual packages are really nice to help with portion control."
positive,13/5/21,"Taste exactly like what you can get from store in Asia, beats all the US made products in the taste department.  Also great for making bread, not sure why not more US grocery stores carry them?!"
positive,1/3/20,"I wasn't sure that we would be able to find a powdered milk that my family would like, but this is it.  We'd gladly use this product on a regular basis if the price was a little lower.  Powdered whole milk doesn't have as long of a shelf-life as non-fat so this should be taken into consideration for long-term food storage."
positive,28/7/20,Tastes great and so easy to make in the K cup machine!  Little more then I like to spend on Kcups but well worth it!
negative,13/5/20,"Tastes funny ...IT WAS NOT LABELED FROM CHINA ON THE INFO PAGE WHEN I BOUGHT IT ...I WILL NOT EAT THIS PRODUCT ...WILL NOT GIVE IT AWAY ...CAN'T RETURN IT ...ONLY THING LEFT TO DO...IS THROW IT AWAY!..will not purchase any food from China ..MY health is more important!"
positive,26/3/21,"I just bought these fiber one bars a couple hours ago and I'm completely satisfied with the taste, actually I was surprised it tasted so good. I will definitely purchase more in the future. The only down side is that it has to many carbs, but taking one a day for those times where you need something sweet is perfect."
positive,29/8/19,"I'm glad I read the reviews saying to only use a few drops in a beverage. Too many drops and it quickly goes from delicious to strange and bitter. The directions on the bottle say 5-8 drops, but I find 2 or 3 is perfect in a 12 oz drink or a cup of yogurt."
negative,7/2/21,"I didn't like the taste of this at all. I tried the Stevia packets before and didn't like them and I thought this would taste better because of the vanilla flavor but I still didn't like it."
positive,14/10/21,"This is the second time my wife and I order these from Amazon. They are extremely hard to find and the one place that sold them, no longer carries them. They taste great, honestly the best mints available. I will continue to order these from Amazon."
positive,7/8/20,"I've loved this tea eversince Starbucks sold it in select stores. Now that they've stopped I needed to find it elsewhere. Please continue to sell Tazo Lotus Green Tea, as it is hard to find, and very much appreciated. Very quick and excellent shipping.<br />Thanks again!"
positive,1/3/20,"I was surprised to finally see vegan baked goods on Amazon. I normally bake my own vegan baked goods but am always looking for products to try or send to my daughters in college. Because I do bake when I have time, I'm pretty picky and I have make pumpkin bread, zucchini bread, muffins, and carrot cake. Marge's  breads were outstanding! They were moist and not overly sweet. The icing on the carrot cake was delicious. They arrived in a couple of days as promised in a cute little basket which I'm using elsewhere now. I did freeze them as soon as they arrived and they held up beautifully. Since my order, I went directly to their website to order just the carrot cake. I wish Amazon would allow the option of only ordering three of the same breads. Thank you Marge's Bakery for making an outstanding product...thank you Amazon for finally carrying some vegan products--please continue to find these small businesses throughout our country!"
positive,28/7/20,"taste better than sea salt and although i still use sea salt too, said to be good for your health in moderation,great price. quality is first rate. delivered on time. so keep a jar in kitchen, order extras to give to friends. sprinkled on salmon before baking is really good and easy."
positive,14/9/21,"These are okay.  I love their Gummi Bears so I thought I'd add to my On-the-road snacks."
positive,17/12/20,"I split this bag up into a bunch of sandwich bags and bring them to work with me, they are great little snacks!"
positive,2/5/20,"Excellent product! Healthy and delicious, this product contains only high quality ingredients, no preservatives or refined refined food items.<br /><br />You can keep them in your office when you are pressed for time and hungry.<br />Mine came with a 2 year shelf life and also has a ""spork"" which is a handy feature."
positive,14/7/21,"Obviously opinions vary on this, but I eat Enjoy life granola daily.  I don't understand the comments about it not being crunchy, unless perhaps people have had outdated bags. I appreciate Enjoy Life being dairy, soy and corn free as well as gluten free, as I can't have any of these.  The Cranapple flavor is the best--I mix it with Erehwon Gluten-free brown rice cereal and use vanilla rice milk.  Since opinions differ so on this product, if you're on a gluten-free diet you should try it."
positive,18/7/19,"This is a really great tasting snack with the right amount of kick.  I bought a 24OZ bag from my local Waldbaums for $6.49.  There was a buy one get one free sale, so I actually got 48OZs for $6.49.  Totally worth it."
positive,1/3/20,"I love simply love it.  It's organic.  It's inexpensive.  It has a wonderful flavor.  This is great hot or cold."
positive,28/7/20,"I'm very happy with this tea.  The flavor is smooth and not bitter.  I've shared it with several people and gotten the same response.  Will buy it again!"
positive,13/6/20,"I'm not sure about the calorie count, but I do enjoy this product."
positive,10/3/20,"All my family really likes this rice. It goes good with fish, chicken or stakes."
positive,9/5/20,"Super tasty and super easy to make, healthy too! I can only recommend this one to anyone who wants organic yummy pancakes with healthy fibers in too."
negative,14/5/19,"My husband and I have each tried drinking this coffee a few times and it tastes bad, a real chemical/artificial taste.  Do not recommend it.  We are throwing away the rest of it, which I don't like to do, but I wouldn't try to pass it off on a friend."
positive,19/10/20,"I love this pumpkin coffee, it tastes and smells great.  Not too much flavor, and it doesn't taste too artificially flavored"
positive,1/3/20,"We also found this to be great tasting. Flavorful, not weird tasting at all.the negative review des not sound like this product at all.  Good value."
positive,28/7/20,"I am not much of a fan of Amaretto.  I followed the advice from other reviewers (purchased the variety pack and tried them all).  The Amaretto and Vanilla flavors are my favorites.  I normally don't drink flavored coffee but that is about to change.  I am so glad to have found this caffeine free option so that I can continue to enjoy a cup or two in the morning.  I really suggest you order the variety pack first and find out what suits your taste."
positive,7/3/20,I am using rice pasta because a family member is gluten intolerant. This pasta tastes so good that everyone in the household eats it.
positive,4/8/20,"First, you can either soak or spray this product.  If you're lazy like I am you can put it in a spray bottle, spray your produce in a colander in the sink, and rinse a bit later. I've never had it affect the taste or appearance of food in any way (with the exception of when it starts to clean the wax from apples & the wax turns whiter & starts to chip off).  When I've used the soak method, I've seen the dirty water after, so I do feel like this does a nice cleaning job.  I love this stuff and many grocery chains don't carry it reliably, so it's great that Amazon has it!"
positive,26/12/19,"These taste great and exactly like their ingredients. Also, they do not have too much sugar. The only thing that I would watch out for is the fat content, since each little bar have 11gms of fat."
positive,28/3/21,"I want to begin by saying that I'm no Cacao expert; this is the first time I've tried it. I wanted to try it for three reasons: 1)Honestly, a trusted friend suggested it, 2)I'm always looking for healthy snacks to fill my day (I'm on the go constantly), 3)Cacao's ""supposed"" health benefits (I'm not saying it does or does not have them...just alluding to the fact that I'm no health/nutritional expert). So, here's what I think. These are going to be an acquired taste (like beer). Actually, they very much remind me of a red wine (a burgundy, maybe)...the bag even smells like wine when you open it up. They are very tiny pieces. They are very crunchy (if you have teeth that are very sensitive I'd think twice about getting these). Upon tasting them: on the front of the palate it tasted very much like a red wine, then slightly bitter, and moving to the back of the palate it tasted very earthy and you got the flavor of cocoa powder...then swallow (you are going to want something to rinse it down...it's a little grainy at that point). I like the texture and I like the taste (but then again, I like wine). I have mixed it into yogurt and I find it rather good...you get less of the wine/bitter flavors and more of the earthy and traditional cocoa powder flavors. I use honey flavored Greek yogurt. I also eat them plain as little nibbles...they don't bother me that way either (a little ""wake-me-up""). If the flavor really offends you, but you want the health benefits, you can order Organic Sugar Cacao Nibs (do an internet search), they are tossed with organic cane syrup (I will try those for a treat soon). That's all I got! Cheers."
negative,6/2/20,Saw this on Dr. Oz so of course I had to try it.  Bitter....bitter....bitter - only way you could eat it was mixed with yogurt.  And...did it help increase my metabolism like Dr. Oz said it would?  Very doubtful.
positive,25/4/21,"This (and most of the Malt o Meal brand cereals) taste just as good as the major name brands, but not the with the high price. Great if your on any kind of a budget."
positive,3/8/20,"All the Fancy Feast Appetizers are top quality and cats love them. They are a little pricey but because my cats enjoy them so much, I purchase them on a regular basis."
positive,15/4/19,"This is one of my all-time favorite candies.  Lays used to have a slogan, ""Bet you can't eat just one!"" and there's no doubt, for me, that's the case with these.  My biggest 'problem' with these is I can't leave them alone and my waistline is suggesting I SHOULD!"
positive,9/3/18,"I first tried Violet Mints several years ago and LOVED them. I recently found them again offered here at Amazon and I HAD to buy them. The flavor is unlike any other ""mint"" or candy you may buy. It truly is a floral smell and taste that is quite delicious. Whenever I eat them I usually get comments from others as to how good or fresh my breath smells. I would highly recommend Violet Mints. Once you try them you'll know why!  :o)"
positive,18/5/18,"I'm never a big fan of any kind of cold cereal. I bought this cereal only because I need some quick/easy food that's also healthy. Wow I was so surprised. This is the most tasty cereal that I have ever had! It definitely doesn't taste as boring as the usual ""healthy"" products and it is indeed healthy! Eating cereal is fun now. I'm so glad that I gave it a try. Will definitely buy more."
positive,9/3/18,"My whole family loves this stuff... tastes great and has a great texture also.  The granola has a ""puffed"" texture so it's not as hard as some other granolas.  The pumpkin seeds give it a great flavor and it's good both with cold milk or warmed as a hot cereal."
positive,27/2/18,The wife had me buy it for her..it actually tastes good with nothing more than a little 2% on it..not real hard like some of the cereals that make your mouth hurt from chewing it up..
positive,20/2/18,"Our family loves all of the Worthington/Loma Linda products, but I was concerned about meatless hot dogs since I think most of them remind me of  Play Doh.  Fortunately, the Veja Links are very tasty and they are nice and firm like real hot dogs.  Buying these cases from Amazon Grocery is a nice deal, too.  I hope they continue to carry them!"
negative,22/3/18,I did not care for the taste or texture. I was able to get rid of these by sharing them at  parties.
positive,12/3/18,"""These were very good. Bought three 36 count boxes and only two pieces were a little bit hard on the top layer of the petite four. Would not hesitate to buy again, very, very good."""
positive,9/2/18,"Great quality, great price!  I'm using this after my workouts instead of sugary Gatorade or similar.  You can even mix in some whey powder after resistance training for an added protein boost -- tastes great.  Organic too... this is the best deal I've found on coconut water so far."
positive,7/12/17,These are one of my favorite rice cake flavors.  They are just a little sweet and a great healthy snack between meals.  Will order again.
positive,24/5/19,"the blueberry flavor is amazing, works well w sparkling water or adding a dash of flavor to lemonade.<br />the product arrived fast and the price was great!"
positive,9/3/18,These were delicious!  I would definitely recommend this for a snack or a wedding!  This was a great purchase for my husband and me.
positive,18/5/18,"In my constant search for gluten free products, I was happy to find this snack bar.  Generally this type product leaves much to be desired, taste wise.  I am very pleased with the taste of this bar and will continue to use it.  I will probably end up trying all the flavors.  I have been happy to find Amazon carries such a good variety of gluten free foods."
negative,23/3/18,"This is good if you like hay for breakfast. Also, it gets soggy quickly. If you add mueslix it greatly improves it."
positive,8/9/20,"This macaroni and cheese is the only kind that both the adults and the kids in our family enjoy.  It has a slightly sharp cheddar flavor that makes it taste so much better than the ""processed cheese food"" types.  Our whole family swears by Annie's Homegrown Deluxe Shells & Real Aged Wisconsin Cheddar and it is much cheaper buying them here than one at a time at the grocery store."
positive,23/2/18,"It is hard to find whole bean decaf coffee in the first place, but finding one that actually tastes great is even better."
positive,18/7/20,Like everything about these except for the 9 grams of fat.  I would like to see it about half that amount or less.
positive,14/6/18,Some coconut oil has no taste or a bad after taste.  EfaGold oil tastes like coconut!  Love it!  We use it for every thing.
positive,2/11/18,"I'm trying to get more whole grains in my diet, and try as I might, I detest whole grain bread. These crackers are a wonderful substitute - crisp and pretty tasty as well! I love them with cheese. The only reason I knocked off a star is once you unwrap the package, you really need to put the whole thing in a Ziplock bag. There's no way to reseal so they stay fresh."
positive,14/10/18,I love these noodle bowls. They taste very good and you can easily add to them if you want...such as chix or more veggies. I have referred many friends to using them.
positive,6/4/20,"This power really gets me ready to workout without making me jittery. I do find that I can workout a little harder, longer without feeling exhausted. Love the taste, too."
positive,9/3/18,My wife is now addicted to this.  She uses it to make her own style of salad dressing and of course it is great for making garlic bread.  This is too good.  We need to buy another one real soon.
positive,18/5/18,"I like this produce because it added up favor in my smoothies. Good for health, and easy to use. But the price is a little too high."
positive,7/3/18,"Had this fabulous oil at my daughters wedding at Frankies in Brooklyn, NY... just had to order some. Extremely fast delivery and they even included a personal note.... highly recommend."
positive,24/1/19,"My husband loves this tea. Out of all of the slimming teas he has tried this is my favorite. A good minty and refreshing taste. Other slimming teas are very licoricey or bitter. This one is nice. I'm not sure how much it slims or suppresses appetite as he usually drinks it after he eats (I've told him a million times it's supposed to be the other way around). However we like drinking it nonetheless. Best price we've found is the bulk pack on Amazon."
positive,27/2/19,"It is very hard finding this item in the stores. I use it on meats,dips and even gravy. It has a great blend of garlic and herbs. I even gave my daughter some of the boxes, now she is hooked"
positive,19/4/20,"This chocolate is very smooth, rich, and full bodied in flavor. It makes great truffles, cookies, or whatever it's used for. Melts evenly and can be used for hot chocolate drinks too."
positive,17/4/20,This brand is the best tasting ever.  No bitter flavor at all.  Filtering the tea after brewing assures a clear beverage.
positive,3/4/20,"What a convenient and tasty product! Love these cups!!! Tuck in your purse,  stroller, car or to work. Very affordable.  Love the 12 packs!!!"
positive,7/8/19,"First, great value for this sport drink and second, the tropical fruit flavor is good (even better cold). I used it to train for a marathon and I will continue to use it; I always feel great and keeps me hydrated on those long runs. Seems to give me the energy and hydration I need.  Also I switched it from FRS, which is also good but the citros powder on the FRS seemed to stay longer on your mouth, not this one.  Mixes very well too-fast with no lumps."
positive,9/3/18,The taste is great(tropical punch).  You have to dilute from the measurements they gave you or its way to strong.  Only knock is that if its not drunk immediately it collects at the bottom
positive,18/5/18,"I use about 1 and 1/2 scoops in my 24 oz. bottle and it tastes great.  It allows me to drink more than I would plain water, which is the best way to stay hydrated.  So far, no complaints."
positive,27/1/19,"I have been drinking the original Cheribundi for a bit now, but it was a tad expensive.  So I checked out Amazon and they had it for a bit less.  I discovered they have additional flavors like the Ginger Cherry.  Cherries help calm inflammation, which is why I picked it up the first time.  I have a bottle about every other day and use it to flavor my homemade kombucha.  Great item."
positive,10/11/19,"I don't eat chips often, but when I do, these are some of my favorites. They have all the flavor and texture of traditional tortilla chips, but it is the subtle lime flavoring that makes them special. The lime flavoring appears to be a seasoning that has been sprinkled on. Some chips have minimal flavor and I find myself looking for those with the most. Still, none of them have quite enough for my tastes. I wish that these chips had more than just a ""hint"" of lime."
positive,8/11/19,"I bought this for a trial run with my new meat grinder and it was excellent! It took a total of two days for shipping and the price was great, too!"
positive,25/10/21,"This is a great tasting healthy drink, but for some reason mine didnt come with straws?"
negative,8/5/20,"this has  too high of a sugar content.  I didn't know they add sugar to coconut water.  Its supposed to be natural.  I am trying to avoid processed sugar.  This is my last order."
positive,28/9/18,"I bought this as an impulse buy today.<br />I'm really trying to cut out soda from my diet.<br />I'm a Pepsi junkie I'll admit it and I have the waistline to prove it.<br />So I brought my water bottle and honestly? I hate water.<br />So I shot three squirts of this into a 24 oz bottle and....it's good.<br />Tastes good.<br />Mixes well.<br />It is a tad pricey but it's either that or go back to my Pepsi.<br />I like it.<br />Recommended."
positive,29/7/19,Buying a latte from a coffee shop or fast-food place can be expensive and contain many calories. I was surprised to see that Hill Bros. has brought out an instant mix called Skinny Latte with has 0 grams of fat and only 100 calories. It takes 3 Tbsp. for every 8 fl oz of boiling water and it taste great!
negative,9/3/18,"I had high hopes for this product.  It was reviewed on the local morning news and I got the impression that it was a good, low-calorie substitute for ice cream.  In my opinion, it is not a good substitute at all.  It doesn't taste like peanut butter at all and barely tastes like chocolate.  My daughter tasted it and thought it tasted gross.  I wouldn't go that far but I will never buy it again - especially since it costs so much more than ice cream.  I'll probably take the suggestions of other reviewers and use it as a base for a shake. I have only tried the chocolate peanut butter flavor so I can't vouch for the other flavors."
positive,18/5/18,"Excellent fine ground coffee that easily bests more well-known brands, it is aromatic and tasty without bitterness. For the price (currently about $5 for 12oz can on an Amazon subscription) you can't beat it."
negative,17/5/20,"I have been buying the fireworks popcorn from Amazon and have been very happy with it. I bought this to try something different. First of all I was disappointed by the rather small container for the price, but then I was very disappointed by the taste. I use canola oil in an electric popper. This popcorn had a slight taste of insecticide. I tasted it in every batch from the jar. It was a very distinctive and unpleasant taste."
positive,26/3/20,"It's a great product. I got some while I was in England and brought some home to share with my family. My children ate the entire box at no time. Very tasty, crunchy... Too bad it's so expensive to buy it here in the U.S.!"
positive,24/2/20,"Since visiting Hawaii, I have fallen in love with Passion Fruit Juice.  This flavor is hard to find, even in California.  Often other tropical flavors are mixed in.<br /><br />This tastes exactly like I expected it too.  It is very concentrated.  I am happy with about an ounce in a 20 ounce bottle.  I add water, ice and Splenda to taste.  The directions say to mix the 16.9 ounce bottle with 8 more bottles of water = makes over a gallon.  As far as I can tell, it is unsweetened.  It does contain some preservatives including cirtic acid, sodium bezoate and metabisulphite.  This comes from Brazil.<br /><br />Great product!! I use it for juice, to flavor Greek yogurt, and to add to a white or yellow cake for a tropical flavor.  You can also make a great pie.  Follow your favorite lemon chiffon recipe, and use this instead of the lemon juice.  I will be buying more.  I bought 4 bottles = same shipping cost as one bottle!!!"
positive,3/5/19,"This true bar is very tasty and feeling and a great pick me up between meals.<br /><br />The flavors are great and and it doesn't leave you dry in the mouth like some bars do."
positive,27/3/20,"The Simply Bars are the best tasting gluten free, dairy & soy free bars that I have tried to date.  You won't be disappointed"
positive,31/12/20,"I had purchased some extract beans (from another company) and was looking forward to trying the higher grade beans.  When I opened the package (which arrived promptly) I was not blown away by a heavenly aroma of vanilla and at first was dissapointed, the beans, however, were (are) moist and plump and when I made a custard with them the flavor was rich and heavenly.  I put the beans into a couple zip lock bags and put them away, and a couple days I started smelling this amazing smell, like REALLY nice pipe tobacco, it of course was the beans (I bought a nice airtight container for them)<br /><br />These are fantastic and far FAR better than anything I've ever gotten from the grocery store, I will be buying these again (and again)."
positive,13/1/20,"These are better than ""regular"" pretzels. They are light and crunchy with a buttery taste. I am so glad to have found these. They restored hope that I can have good food without the ""aftermath"" that typically comes with eating.<br /><br />My mother, who has no problem with gluten, tried them and liked them. She even packed up some to take with her after tasting them. She was surprised, because she thought they were going to be salty - like ""normal"" pretzels."
positive,21/9/20,"I was shocked after tasting these to find that I like these better than other pretzels that are not gf, which is great due to having to switch to gf diet.  This makes a wonderful snack and the price is not that bad (even in the store, meijer's by me and whole foods both carry)"
positive,2/12/20,An excellent product that holds up well.  Not soggy and very tasty.  These rice noodles are especially wonderful in soup.  On the box there is a terrific recipe I immediately tried.  My husband and I loved it.
positive,20/11/19,"The banana flavor lean body has a great taste! It doesnt have the watered down nutri-sweet taste to it either. I have been very satisfied with the lean body ready to go shakes so far although I havent yet tried all the flavors. My husband usually drinks the pure protien ready to go shakes and he recently got a hold of mine and now he wants me to buy the lean body ones for him because they taste so much better. I told him he cant because they are more expensive then his but I dont think he's going to let me get away with it!"
positive,2/12/20,"I bought Blue Sky Organic Black Cherry pop at a local health store along with their orange.  While I found the orange to taste a bit flat and un-orange, the black cherry was outstanding!  Just the right amount of sweet, not over powering at all.  I do not like my drinks to taste like they are full of high fructose corn syrup.  The cane juice gives it the taste it needs and a healthful reprieve from HFC.  The cherry flavor was decently bold and very refreshing.  I love that Amazon has this pop for sale and as an option for repete orders because I can't afford to buy it from the health store too often!"
positive,11/12/19,"I am not a coffee drinker, but tea is what wakes me up in the morning. This is a great black tea, with a wonderful flavor.  I french press it to bring out the flavor, this loose leaf tea is perfect for this.  I have never enjoyed a cup of tea more than this one."
positive,20/11/19,"All of the Mrs. Dash marinates are wonderful.  They're quick and delicious.  We initially tried them for their health benefits... but the flavor is why we continue to buy them.  I highly recommend every flavor!"
positive,28/6/20,"These were excellent for the price. The gummies were soft and fresh and tasted great. I'm looking forward to purchasing them again in the near future."
positive,8/8/20,"I have purchased two of these products and the only reason my review is 4 stars instead of 5 is because on my second shipment, the cap was loose on one of the bottles and it ended up pouring all over the other bottles in the carton. I was wondering why all my bottles were sticky until I hit the one that was almost completely empty :(<br /><br />Otherwise great drink."
positive,14/7/21,"Everyone in my house loves these cookies, even my sister who is not into ""healthy foods"""
positive,2/12/20,"My wife and I love to cook. This product is excellent. We have used it as directed and the results were great pulled pork. we also have added our own spin by adding other spices and herbs or a little wine. McCormick's BBQ pulled pork has never let us down, whether used as directed or adding a few of our favorite flavors we have always had mouth watering, exceptional pulled pork. If you have not tried this product, please do yourself a favor and give it a try, I believe you will be extremely satisfied with the results. Our most difficult problem is waiting for the slow cooker to finish blending the flavors, but it is worth every minute we wait just thinking how darn good dinner is going to be.<br /><br />Al Schweiger"
positive,20/11/19,The basis of my diet is using the Zesty Italian with little or no oil and I still get that great taste.
positive,1/3/21,"Exactly how I expected, but more gel than paste. Actually, no paste at all, just gel.<br /><br />Like Vanilla Bean extract, but without the alcohol bit.<br /><br />Great."
positive,5/5/21,"Knowing that I like ramen my sister suggested that I give these a try. I'm on my second order as I really enjoy the flavor and texture. The noddle's in this Yakisoba have a different flavor and texture then what I am use to in the ramen packets that I normally eat but are very tasty. As with most of these type products it is easy to prepare and the flavor can be adjusted to your taste by the amount of seasoning used.<br /><br /> I reason for only 4 stars has to do with the container that is used. After it is cooked in the microwave and the lid is peeled off there is a sticky adhesive left around lip. Not a problem if you are going pour the contents into a bowl but kind of gets in the way when eating directly from the container."
positive,2/12/20,I already loved Raisin Bran but this is even better.  I love the almonds and there are crunch bits that stay that way through the whole bowl.  The flavor is the same Raisin Bran that I love with a little cinnamon flavor boost and extra crunch.  I think it is awesome.
positive,20/11/19,"I like the original Raisin Bran and it was a staple in our home growing up, but I think I really like this much better.  When eating the original Raisin Bran I actually added a little extra sugar, not sure why exactly, but I always felt that it needed it.  No extra sugar needed with this new Cinnamon & Almond Raisin Bran.  It has the right amount of sweetness, crunch, almonds, and cinnamon.  I was afraid the cinnamon would be overpowering, but it is a perfect balance.  Not sure if the flakes turn soggy, like the orginal flakes, because I keep eating it too fast to find out.  My six year old was eating it straight from the box last night and he said it was delicious.  I would definitely purchase this cereal again!"
positive,9/10/21,"I like this a lot as a topping on my popcorn instead of butter. It's very good and has kept well in the refrigerator after several months. I will order more.<br /><br />Update:<br />I bought a second batch. I didn't have room in my fridge so I've been leaving it in the pantry. I've had it a few months now and it still tastes great."
positive,6/3/21,GREAT SUBSTITUTE FOR SODA AND TASTE GREAT!  DISSOLVES COMPLETELY WITH NO ADDED RESIDUE!  I WILL TRY OTHER FLAVORS FROM THIS MANUFACTURES.
positive,12/2/21,This is a great tasting coffee.  It gets my day started off on the right foot.
positive,2/12/20,"I am a real coffee lover and am hooked on Senseo coffee.  My regular coffee pot is gathering dust in the corner of my kitchen.  I recently tried Sumatra and just fell in love with it.  If you like the real taste of coffee you'll love it as much as I do.  Highly recommend this."
negative,20/11/19,THE COFFEE MAKER WORKS FINE. I AM NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE TASTE OF THE COFFEE. IT TASTES TOO MUCH LIKE INSTANT.
negative,25/6/21,"Not as good quality as the regular flavors of Senseo coffees and we have had our machines for over 6 years... Medium and Dark Roast, Kona and Breakfast blend are by far the best. Sumatra is good also if you like dark rich coffee...<br />Love the ease of the pod system but will probably go to the K-Cups! Just not available enough anymore."
positive,17/3/20,"The packaging isn't too sophisticated, and (as another review mentioned) it's more liquid than other kinds of tahini, but it really tastes great.<br /><br />This how I've used it:<br />A Goya package of dry chickpeas - dipped in water for 24 hours, then boiled for 3 hours<br />About 8 ounce Tahini<br />Half a cup water<br />Lemon juice<br />Salt<br />Garlic<br />Blend everything until smooth"
positive,20/10/21,"This stuff tastes great.  I wasn't expecting much when I mixed it with my orange juice, but I was wrong.  I can't claim any miracles in the health department, but I haven't had any recent cholesterol checks either.  It makes a delicious smoothie, and I will continue to use it because I read and believe the studies on acai."
positive,21/7/20,"This was the first product from Amy's that I tried, and I like it.  It doesn't taste like regular chili, but I think that it has a good taste to it.  The sodium content is quite high, though, so check that out if your watching your sodium intake.  I think that it's a little too expensive, but I'll probably buy it again if it goes on sale."
positive,22/2/21,"This coffee has a wonderful flavor and provides the convenience of a one cup brew instead of a pot.  You may also purchases flavors and it's as good as the $5.00 cup you get at one of the coffee chains.  The automatic refill program offered is an excellent and convenient way to make sure you never run out!"
positive,8/6/21,almost the best home brewed coffee i have ever had and the price is great much less expensive than the grocery store i highly reccomend it if your into coffee
positive,2/12/20,Got this for my sister and had a bite. As some one who normally eats gummies i gotta say  i thought it tasted better then the normal sized bears. Also i dont recommend eating it in one sitting ;)
positive,20/11/19,Love these. They taste so good and are good for you. I love giving my son something that is not full of un-natural sugars!
positive,25/1/21,"I have been drinking powdered cocoa for nearly 40 years.  I consider myself pretty familiar with the powdered/add water-type cocoas and most of them taste like sand.  They are gritty and are either too sweet or far too bitter or have no real flavor at all (and stay in a thick lump at the bottom of the mug no matter how much you stir with a spoon).<br /><br />In nearly 40 years, I have only found two brands of cocoa that did not taste like gritty sludge (e.g., Swiss Miss, Carnation, Nestle's).  One powdered cocoa is from the LDS Church and it's almost impossible to get in Kentucky.  The Distribution Center is in Indianapolis and none of the wards here seem to have anyone who holds the calling of Preparation Specialist; therefore, no one goes to Indy very often.  The second great cocoa was made by Cold Stone Creamery.  It was sold through Walmart and was as smooth as the Church cocoa.  Unfortunately, Walmart no longer stocks it.  I'm not sure it's even manufactured any more.<br /><br />Yesterday I ran across Stevens Cocoa.  It was on the shelf for $1.00 (that's right -- a measly buck) so I decided to try it.  I knew that if I didn't like it, I could take it to work and give it away.<br /><br />I'm in love.<br /><br />This stuff is equally as good as the cocoa from the LDS Church and Cold Stone Creamery.  One sip and I was hooked. It dissolves well, it's not overly sweet, it has a nice mild flavor and it's just downright good.  I top it with Redi-Whip for fun but it doesn't need it, it's good without any help.<br /><br />I'm headed back to stock up on more cans.  If it disappears from the shelves in a couple of weeks, it's nice to know I can get it from Amazon.  I never thought I'd fall in love with a product enough to buy it from Amazon when the supply dried up on the shelves but I'm making an exception for this cocoa.  It's worth it."
positive,1/7/21,"Like the chocolate, hard to find the other flavor, don't know why but no one carries it."
positive,30/9/20,"Needless to say these cookies didn't last long once they were opened. They reminded my wife of the Tagalongs the Girl Scouts used to sell.<br /><br />Very smooth fudge coating and that oh-so-lovely Oreo crunch. I could eat these all day.<br /><br />Viva la Oreo!"
positive,15/3/20,"I love Oreos, especially these new fudge ones. They're now my favorite. I've tried both the mint and the peanut butter versions now, and while the peanut butter are good, the mint is still my favorite. That being said, these aren't bad at all. I still very much enjoyed them. My two kids (5 year old boy and 2 year old girl) both loved them as well. Whenever they could, they were begging for these cookies. In my mind, that's a good sign. If you've got a kid begging for these, you've got a pretty good product.<br /><br />My one disappointment is that it's not the full cookie. It's just half of it. Maybe they've done that to cut costs, but, as I recall, there was a similar Oreo product at one time that offered the full cookie. Either way, still worth it, and definitely a cookie I'd recommend."
positive,6/7/21,"Those familiar with regular Oreos (and, really, who isn't?) won't find anything too terribly unfamiliar with these peanut butter Oreo Fudge Cremes.  They consist of a single wafer which is topped with a layer of peanut butter creme, then enrobed in a fudge coating.  The wafer is thin and nicely crispy.  The creme is purportedly peanut butter-flavored, but, to be honest, I was unable to pick up any of that.  It was still tasty, just not as peanut butter-y as I'd hoped.  The fudge coating was not too thin, not too thick, just nicely adding a hint of creamy chocolate goodness.<br /><br />What else can really be said about an Oreo?  Although I might wish that the peanut butter flavor was more intense, I was still quite happy to nibble on them.  I certainly wouldn't mind doing so again."
positive,29/6/21,"These pickles are amazing.  Once you have tried this unremarkable flavor, you won't go back to those retail manufactured brand of pickles.  Nothing comes close to these pickles.  Definitely will be a repeat customer!"
positive,29/6/21,"Medium/light roast you can really smell and enjoy the aroma of high quality arabica.  If you are a fan of medium/light roast you will enjoy this coffee.  Smooth, no burning flavor."
positive,26/7/21,"Small, just right for a little something sweet.  Ginger flavor is good, it comes on gradually until it is almost intense.  A bargain."
negative,21/10/21,The mushrooms I received had absolutely no flavor.  It was like soaking up cream sauce with pieces of rubber.  Really disappointing.
positive,25/10/21,"These colors are so true to life and vibrant!  The drip, drop out of the bottle makes it so easy to duplicate the exact same color again.  The food color doesn't change the taste or texture of any food.  I had no problems with shipping, and it was super fast."
positive,29/6/21,I ordered three bags of these with a past order. All I can say is yum. I did not compare prices too much but this product tasted better and fresher than any I have found in local markets.
positive,5/7/21,"I have nasty food allergies to wheat, dairy, eggs, corn, peanuts, and about 2 dozen other foods so when I find something I can actually eat I have a tendency to buy a case.  Simply put, these are great.  They have a wonderful, soft texture with a mildly sweet (but not too sweet) flavor.  For anyone with allergies or intolerances like myself, they're a real lifesaver.  They're satisfying, nicely packaged, and very fresh tasting.  I'll be buying more."
positive,17/9/21,These are the best gummi bears available. I got hooked on them when I was in Germany. I was so happy to see I could get them through Amazon!
positive,18/8/21,we searched everywhere to find this jerky.  It is the best on the market and they ship very quickly.  We had it in less than 3 days. We have already reordered it.
positive,31/7/21,when i first bought this product i thought instant cornmeal it csnnot be that tasty! wow i cud not believe it it tasted like the real thing. very easy<br /> to travel around with and a small flask of hot water. Very filling.
positive,18/10/21,"very tasty and delicious. I like this tea very much. It has a very good flavour and my whole family likes when I serve them a cup of tea,"
positive,29/6/21,"I had used these smaller jars of honey while on a trip in France a few years ago. They were in the hotels with the breakfasts. I don't use honey very often and the larger jars I purchase at the grocery store end up going to waste. These little jars are perfect for me. The flavor is not too intense and the size is perfect for my use. Plus, they bring back memories of a wonderful trip I took to a country where I grew up."
positive,16/9/21,"These are very good!  I can't say which is my favorite flavor, but I'm leaning towards the Key Lime. When I read the review and description I figured they'd be crispy, but they are normal shortbread with little chips or ""snaps"" you might say of flavor.  I love the packaging of the four flavors as well. I will be reordering."
positive,24/8/21,"Emerald Cove Organic Toasted Nori Sheets, ever since I found the Emerald toasted Nori I put it everywhere, I make Sushi with brown rice, decorate Fish dishes with shredded Nori and even fish burritos. It has a pleasant fishy taste that I like, each sheet has only 10 calories and each bag contain a packet of moisture-absorbing powder to protect the Nori from dampness.<br /><br />Also on the back of the bag there is a Pledge of Organic Purity ""All Ingredients Certified Organic - No Ingredients have been Irradiated"" I am glad about that because that was my very first concern. There is a nice and simple Sushi recipe on the back as well and Emerald Cove Nori has no Sodium. Even my Cat likes it! Product of China, Certified Kosher, I like that! Thank You"
positive,24/6/21,"These things are better than steak.. filet mignon! It was well worth the purchase of this package. It saves you a couple bucks versus buying them in the store. Go ahead, splurge yourself and get some."
positive,27/9/21,I love it.  Going to be on my shopping list from now on.  Great as a snack.  Dont need milk but great that way too.
positive,29/6/21,Ribs were very tasty and tender and I will definitely buy them again.  Just had to put them in aluminum foil with a little water and heat so easy to fix.
positive,5/8/21,"This product is the best raw honey...  Growing up, my dad had bee hives in South Louisiana and this is exactly how I remember the taste of raw honey.  I highly recommend this product."
positive,29/6/21,"I did not know I was a fan of soy milk! It taste great and I have one in the morning instead of cow's milk. It is also gluten free for all the Celiac's out there. No casein or lactose as well. I have already recommended this to friends."
positive,31/7/21,We have artifical sweetners for years. I tried this sweetner. Now we only use this. The other sweetner do not taste as good.
positive,11/9/21,"Hard to beat the flavor of this stuff, its fresh and clean.<br /><br />Still not going to blow your head off, maybe Melinda needs to come out with<br />a XXXXXXXXXXXtra Hot version of this stuff, but you'll still have a hard time<br />finding any other habanero sauce that tastes better on fish, pork, or chicken.<br /><br />Still not as universal as Tabasco Habanero, but a great complement to veggies<br />and other light dishes, and when you go to Firehouse for a sub you can try this<br />on your smoked turkey and you will be pleasantly amazed at the effect. Great stuff,<br />a staple for any decent collection. BTW, if you like the flavor of this stuff and<br />still crave more heat, check out Iguana Radioactive Atomic Sauce, its got the same<br />basic ingredients as Melinda's, the same consistency, but is about 6X up the heat<br />scale from this relatively weak XXXX sauce. 5 Scovies"
positive,12/8/21,"Unusual and very tasty.  As you might expect, they taste like okra.  I wish they were a little less expensive, but I don't know of any alternative."
positive,31/7/20,"This product sells for $7 at trader joes for ONLY one bag!!!! Here you get 4 BAGS FOR $22 and since Amazon Ships it the Shipping is SO FAST! All you need to add is Cinnamon and brown sugar and you are good to go! I have eaten this for everymeal and promise you it is great! Also, it is very very filling! I have missed oatmeal since being diagnosed with Celiac's and am so grateful I found this prodcut. Thank you Amazon for making this much more affordable, I will continue ordering it from you!!"
positive,13/6/20,"Lately I've been trying about 20 or more sauces to find just the right one that balances flavor and burn.  But, to put this into perspective, I really go for the insanely hot so this may need to be measured by that.  This sauce is not really that hot, but the taste is awesome.  It definately has heat, but doesn't really have much burn.  In short; if you want something that shames commercial pizza place hot wings in both heat and taste this is a great choice.  In fact I'm browsing the internet to see about ordering a case.  (for those days when I don't want my food to have the last highly pronounced word if you follow my meaning.)"
positive,31/7/20,"When I got my miniature Labradoodle puppy, the breeder recommended getting one of these.  I am so glad I did.  This will entertain your dog for hours.  The inserts are a little expensive but well worth the price for the amount of time your dog will enjoy this product.  So far she has not been able to damage the ball itself, after 8 months.  For me that means it should last about two years or more before I have to replace it.  For a puppy/dog toy that is ""everlasting"".  I love it and highly recommend it.  Just a note: my dog is small and the medium size ball seems perfect."
positive,13/6/20,"Stevia is a safe, natural sugar-substitute that has been used for thousands of years.  I have used it safely myself for years.  NOW is my favorite brand because there is no bitter aftertaste.  Use it in Coffee, tea, yogurt, milk, cereal, puddings, fruit dips, etc.  It is truly an amazing produce that keeps my life 'sweet' and not fat :)"
positive,26/9/20,"If you are looking for a fantastic glass of iced tea WITHOUT the fuss, this product is for you! Just add water, your favorite sweetner, and enjoy!"
positive,17/10/20,"I am completely hooked on Lipton's glass size cold brew tea bags. The small tea bags can stay in your glass of tea all day and never leak leaves like the big tea bags.  Thank you Lipton!"
positive,14/12/20,"We like to make Smoothies in our home. Throw a little yogurt, some milk, some ice and lots of fruit into a blender and yummmmm. But sometimes we are out of yogurt or milk or even fruit. Or sometimes we want a fruit that isn't in season. That is where this smoothie mix comes in.<br /><br />You put this smoothie mix into a blender with some ice and you have a smoothie. W<br />e have tried the peach flavor and the wild berry flavor. Out of the two, we prefer this peach. It has a great flavor and mixes up well.<br /><br />In addition to using this for smoothies, we also use this when we make ice cream.<br /><br />This is a great product that will save you time on those mornings when you are rushed and just need something fast for breakfast or a snack.<br /><br />Enjoy."
positive,29/5/20,"I love Mrs. May's. These aren't my favorites of what they make, but they are tasty and handy to have around. The cashews or the black sesame seeds are the five star snacks!"
negative,9/12/20,"I am disappointed in this product. First, there's a distinct aftertaste. Secondly, it is not as sweet as they promise, and doesn't work at all in cold drinks.  If you need a sugar substitute I suggest Somersweet, not perfect either but better than this.<br />  Sorry I was taken in by the promises."
positive,4/8/20,"My 14 year old cat wasn't eating, had to have a tooth pulled, and was generally miserable.  He's always been thin and a picky eater.  After the tooth was pulled, he was interested in food, but wouldn't eat.  I had to squirt it in his mouth a few times before he got the idea I wasn't going to give up.  Once he started drinking it, he loved it and began asking for it.  His coat is thicker and doesn't fall out as much.  He's put on weight, and even if he's having a 'sick day' from hair balls, he can drink this without throwing up the rest of the day.  He's so much happier and plays more.  Now even if there's a day when he isn't interested in food, I don't worry as much because he's so much healthier now.  Thank You !!"
positive,31/7/20,"Easy to make without a bread maker and very tasty.  It's good with everything, but we especially like it for breakfast toasted with butter and honey.  Very good value."
positive,13/6/20,"I loved this bread.  Very tasty with a good texture and taste.  I tried making something similar from scratch and it didn't turn out anything like this bread.  Slices great warm or cold.  I bake for my boss and her family and they all voted a resounding ""Yes, we like this"" when I brought her in a loaf.  Freezes well and toasts up great either plain or with butter or cream cheese.  My boss ate hers with spaghetti after lightly toasting.  She said it was outstanding and wanted more (am I surprised, no).  Would highly recommend if you want a good Italian style bread.  I made mine in my horizonetal Wolfgang Puck breadmaker and used a crisp or dark crust setting.  I tried all other settings, light and medium and the bread came out great with a little different texture but still great nonetheless."
positive,21/11/20,I make bread all the time & always look for variety...this bread is tasty & delicious! I have a two loaf bread machine and my husband kids favorite is this one!
positive,25/5/21,We want you to know that we are very pleased with the quality of service your company provides. We sincerely appreciate your responsiveness and the way you conduct business. We have recommended your company to others because of our satisfaction with your service & product. We look forward to doing business with you for years to come.
positive,25/5/21,"Received 3 boxes.  1 box was shy one squeeze pack.  Daughter was EXTREMELY angry when she did inventory.  Otherwise she's happy.  Will be more cautious/reactive if it happens again."
positive,20/1/21,"Great, refreshing, nonperishable treat - keep it under my desk at work and enjoy an 'apple' whenever I have a craving."
positive,15/1/21,"Product is as advertised!! My grandkids love them and I do too.  Great for on the go! B<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019413WA"">Brothers-ALL-Natural Fuji Apple Crisps, 0.35-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>"
positive,8/2/21,"I love this chili! I've seen Amy's products in the supermarket and have been really tempted to purchase any of their products. I've had other meatless products that were awful but this was entirely different experience. I'ts spicy but still holds it flavor and you would never know it's meatless.  I Will definitely order this again."
positive,10/2/21,"I like these because they're not too sweet. But of course that also means you can just keep eating and eating them without realizing how many you've plowed your way through, so be careful...  a three-cookie serving contains 140 calories and 5 grams of fat<br /><br />Lots of fruit, and the citrus flavor REALLY comes through. And as they're thin and crisp, they're the perfect accompaniment to a cup of tea because they don't immediately go soggy. I'm not usually a big cookie person, but I'll probably be getting these again."
positive,9/10/20,"This have been a huge hit with the whole family.  They remind me of a tea cracker more than a cookie or anything ""Newton"".  They aren't overly sweet and have a subtle orange and cranberry flavor.  The cranberries can be a bit chewy but add to the overall texture of the cookies.  They also travel well and are great cookies for lunch boxes and toddlers!"
positive,31/7/20,"These are a pretty healthy, tasty snack.  They are more like a cracker, with a bit of dried fruit baked into the product.  My kids loved them!"
positive,13/6/20,"What I liked about this product was first, the way it was packaged.  Inside there are several rows of thin cookies in a plastic tray.  You can grab to your heart's content.  When eaten, the cookie and the bits of fruit blend and make a great taste.<br /><br />The only qualm is the package wire on the top.  It is not really easy to close and that may need to be redesigned.  But the product itself is tasty and I can't get enough of the bits of fruit.  What a good idea!"
positive,5/12/20,"I requested two types of Chips Ahoy!'s newest cookies.  These were tasty, and the others were not.  So don't interpret this review as relevant to similar cookies... just these alone.<br /><br />The cookies tasty chocolatey and don't have an overpowering processed aftertaste one finds with many foods of this type.  They are very sweet, but you can tell you're eating a chocolate cookie.  In moderation (I had two at most at a time) it's decent and easy snack.  They are very chewy, almost a dough consistency, but the cookie doesn't fall apart easily. I think the frosting center helps the cookie's structure.<br /><br />Very good with a cup of black coffee."
positive,1/11/20,"We all enjoyed these very chocolatey cookies!  They have a nice chewy texture and gooey center which complement each other well.  They may not be homemade, but they were still great with a glass of milk!"
negative,14/1/21,"This product is sweetened with Splenda, and tastes very artificial. Maybe if you like diet soda you will like this, but the 3 people that sampled it did not."
negative,6/6/21,"The seeds are really good, but this new flavor is a big time MISS.  The taste is just terrible.  I bought a whole case, I don't know if I will eat em.  I have to put a bunch in my mouth, then put in some water, rinse the flavors off in my mouth and spit all the liquid out, just to eat the seeds.  I don't know what they were thinking on this flavor.  It is rather indescribable.  They should've made a spicy BBQ or cajun instead."
positive,21/7/20,The MTR bisi bela bath is authentic and tasty. I highly recommend it. You can have this with<br />pappad or some yoghurt on the side and it makes a complete meal.
negative,5/1/21,"They came during a heat wave so some of them melted. However that's not the issue. They tasted burnt and just not that good. The ones at Trader Joe's are soo much better."
positive,23/1/21,"I honestly think it makes my regular recipes taste better then when I make them with table salt. About half as salty as table salt so the 5 lb bag was a must for me. Reasonable price. Great way to lead a little bit healthier lifestyle. You're going to eat salt anyway so why not get the extra minerals and a great taste."
positive,31/7/20,"Good flavor, you can use less than the directions suggest and get the same flavor without the thickness of syrup. Good stuff though"
positive,13/6/20,We have been using enjoy life products for awhile due to life threatening food allergies. During a walk for FAAN they gave out samples of this cookie. My child loved it and wanted more. At the time they did not carry it in the stores so I found it online. It was a great purchase. It came when expected and the cookies disappeared fast. I will be ordering more soon. :)
positive,1/12/20,"I've been using this liquid sucralose for about 10 months on a daily basis, and I couldn't be happier. If you are on a low-carb diet, remember you are adding carbs to your coffee with every packet you open (from the anti-caking agents). But you don't have to be on a special eating regimen to appreciate this, because it is so cost effective. One 2oz bottle lasts me about 5 months for ~13 dollars. It is easy to over sweeten if you aren't careful (especially when the bottle is full), but you get used to that."
positive,30/1/21,best big train flavor out there! and price is way cheaper than finding these packets locally at a coffee shop.
positive,1/1/21,Loved the flavor of strawberry and rhubarb - texture perfect for me.  Definitely would order again.  A treat for me!
positive,11/1/21,This is a great dish!  I thoroughly enjoy it every time I eat it.  So easy to prepare.
positive,31/7/20,"I made these Brownies for a function I was attending and didn't mention they were Gluten Free. I made two batches and they all went! I'm not too crazy over most GF items, but this is one of the best. The price on Amazon is much less then the price in supermarkets."
positive,13/6/20,This is the best popcorn ever.  I wish all stores sold it but so far I have found it only on Amazon and some Wal Mart stores.  I would rather buy it from Amazon of course.  It tastes great and is also just the right amount to watch a movie at home or to share with a partner.
negative,14/1/21,"I recently got a Keurig coffeemaker and tried out different brands of Decaf to come up with a favorite. Newman's Own is definitely not among them. Taste very much like a cheap restaurant coffee, watered down with hardly any coffee taste. I happen to like robust coffee taste, and this one doesn't even qualify as ""medium"".<br />If you like good coffee taste in your decaf coffees, I would highly recommend the Green Mountain Robust Magic and for a little lighter touch the Donut House Decaf or Tully's.<br />Also, of all the different brands I tried, the Newman's Own was the only decaf that gave me an acid stomach reaction.<br />NOT recommended!"
negative,7/12/20,"OK, so some people like it, some people don't. I'm one of those who was excited about the prospect of getting iced tea from my Keurig, but was sorely disappointed by the taste from this tea.  It had a very artificial flavor, much like instant tea, and was no comparison to actual brewed iced tea.  I can only recommend getting the smallest box you can to see if it suits you.  Like the other reviewer, I can't bring myself to use what's left, and will probably end up throwing it out at some point.  My husband agreed, and he's a big iced tea drinker...and not all that picky about the taste.  He won't drink it, I won't drink it, and the cat won't drink it, so out it goes.  I do want to add that I use the hot teas and have liked them very much (especially the green tea).  There's just something about the iced flavors that don't work."
positive,5/5/21,But as far as it helping me produce more milk - not sure it helped much.  Tastes good though.
positive,23/11/20,"My husband loves this tea which isn't always available at the local grocer. The fact that the Amazon subscribe & save program brings it to our door at regular intervals just makes life easy."
positive,29/8/20,"I bought this tea to try something new (I was tired of ordinary bergamote teas), and now I've ordered it again. Great taste, nice can."
positive,18/1/21,"Good healthy snack.  Good plain, and also I tried mixing with plain yogurt and honey which is a great snack and adds a bit of protein to the meal."
positive,18/6/21,"Right. I know what you're going to say: it's granola.  How exciting can granola be?<br /><br />This stuff is delicious. Normally I need granola to be with something: Milk or yogurt or fruit cobbler or something like that. This stuff I was eating out of the bag like snack chips.  It has just the right cinnamon taste, and the oats taste fresh. You know how some granolas seem sort of cardboardy and tasteless? This does not. The clusters are crisp and flavorful--not just cinammon and sweet, but hearty and oaty.  It's like the best part of a healthy cereal...minus the milk and the not so tasty part.<br /><br />If this came in snackpacks I'd buy a ton to tuck in my bag for lunches.  Heck that's what I did with half this bag!"
positive,18/6/21,"I received one pack of Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds through Amazon Vine, and it made a great breakfast for me. Very tasty, and the flax seeds gave it some texture as well. My only regret is that I didn't get more--it was so delicious that I ate it all in one serving. I'll probably be ordered some more soon."
positive,7/7/21,"This 100% whole grain is very tasty.  The clusters are small enough you can toss it into yogurt or eat as a cereal, but they are also large enough you can eat them as a snack.  Lightly sweet, full of texture and cholesterol free, these blueberry vanilla clusters are very healthy.  With a high source of fiber, 750mg of omega-3 fatty acids and 16g of whole grain, you can feel good about eating this.  It's very economical and convenient.  I look forward to trying other flavors!"
positive,18/6/21,"the dried blue berry are a little chewy but they taste great. I add them to my Special K in the morning. And talk about a great BM, this will do it. In fact if you eat to much... well never mind, just dont east to much without eating a bunch of cheese afterwards."
positive,7/7/21,"This snack is good, really good. The flavors aren't overwhelming. The texture is nice, crispy and crunchy. This is great for those times when you need a little something to stop the craving."
negative,1/7/21,"really bad taste. Not natural at all. We bought a pack but only used one. I wish we hadn't bought it."
positive,7/7/21,"Works well, taste is good, about to order a new box.  If you are a diabetic this is nice to have around the house or office."
positive,23/7/21,"This one by far is my favorite as far as taste is concerned.  I use this as a snack to get me through to my next actual meal.  There is a good amount of fiber, low in sugar and very few net carbs.  I really like the taste too."
positive,20/7/21,"Compare to other nutritional bars out there you'll find these are one of the few that are low in calories (150) and pack a good amount of protein (11 grams), and they taste great!  I love these bars."
positive,19/7/21,These cookies are really good tasting. The Gooey Chocolate is flavored just right to my taste.  Sweet but not overly sweet.  Some of the best cookies to come along in years.
positive,18/6/21,"These are soft chocolate chip cookies that also have a fudge filling.  Very good, although I slightly prefer the Megafudge version, as these are just a tiny bit sweeter than I prefer."
positive,7/7/21,"Easy food. Open can, drain water from can, take product out, fill with steamed rice. It makes a great, easy lunch. I'm a big fan.<br />I've just got to figure out how to get them out of the can without tearing the packets..."
positive,27/6/21,"I'm so excited to see Bobo bars here.  They are my favorite of all the healthy snack bars and usually have a hard time finding them where I live. Hooray for Bobo's!<br /><br />PS....Amazon DOES need to work out some of their shipping problems."
positive,21/7/21,"These are the best sardines I have ever eaten...not as salty as others I have tried. Place one fillet in half an ""Embasa Brand Pepper Jalapeno Whole"" with the seeds and core removed and you'll think you are in sardine heaven!!!"
positive,18/6/21,"I saw this at Whole Foods yesterday, and because I'm always up for trying something new, I bought this flavor.  I am so pleased with it!  It is so fresh and clean tasting.  It doesn't taste artificial, and it doesn't leave me wanting for more flavor.  It is really a fantastic 100% organic, sugar free beverage, and I'll be repurchasing for sure.  I can't wait to try the other flavors :)"
positive,7/7/21,"This is the best tasting health drink I have had. I wanted something with Resveratrol but did not want to have to take a pill. This tastes like grape Gatorade almost. Really good. Price wise, it is pricey. But I am only drinking one a day and it is no more expensive than some people's Starbucks coffee in the morning."
positive,30/6/21,"My wife and I both love these.  Looking to possibly make a bulk purchase now!  One caution, since you are paying a premium for organic, raw, sprouted foods made in a family business - they go quickly.  Eat them slowly and savor the taste.  I also recommend GoRaw's other products as well. I like their pumpkin seed based product a lot."
positive,1/7/21,"this is first time trying Ambrosia Pure Honey from Colorado's W Slope, and my first implosion is great for the taste and price. However, I feel the honey is not really pure since the consistency is not as I expected when I purchased it. Overall, I like the taste and the kids do too."
positive,24/8/21,"These little things are delicious! I didn't expect much. My wife bought them apparently, and they were just sitting on the kitchen table. She must not have told me about them because she figured I'd eat them all. If that's the case, she's probably right. These things definitely exceeded all my expectations, and were good enough for me to immediately come here and right a review. They do seem pretty pricey here though, but I'm not sure what they run in the stores since I didn't buy them personally."
positive,21/7/21,"These biscuits are very good and my second favorite to the blueberry. These biscuits are not filling enough alone for breakfast so I eat them as a sweet snack. I wish the calories were lower, but that doesn't deter me from buying.  They are a winner."
positive,25/6/21,The product is as advertised.  Very good chocolate.  It is a good alternative for those who do not drink coffee.
positive,13/9/21,"This was the 2nd time I tried Pamela's bread mix & it's the closest to regular bread that I have found.  Great Product."
positive,18/6/21,"I have been a fan of Pamela's Products baking mixes for awhile now. This bread mix is one of my favorites. It is really healthy and easy to work with. I am always guaranteed good tasting bread when I use this mix. I really think it a good deal for healthy quality food. I don't have a lot of time to bake from scratch but I do like home made break so this is a good compromise."
positive,7/7/21,emergen -c acai berry 30 day count wow what a differnce i feel great getting ready for back to school no sick days here i take it in the morning acai berry is sweet so i add more water to less sweeten
negative,15/7/21,"These don't even taste like cashews.  They are fresh and crunchy enough but you would never know they are supposed to be cashews.  I don't know anything about roasting cashews but I think it's funny that every other brand seems similar in taste and Emerald does not.  It's not that they have an off-flavor.  They have no flavor."
positive,11/7/21,"I had my first taste of this coffee at the cafe Monde in New Orleans, of course with their hand made donuts(Beneigns). The coffee is very strong, when you brew it, use much less than you would normally use than regular coffee. The chicory adds a distinct flavor but also smoothes it out. Its famous for a good reason... but remember to use less when brewing. John from Buffalo"
positive,7/10/21,"My cat was extremely ill and I had to give him 7 pills a day. He's a big kitty--about 20 lbs--and was really fighting me, or taking the pill and then spitting it out. I came across these while searching for something else and decided to try them. Wow! What a difference. As soon as he heard me open the bag he came running to get his ""treat."" This has got to be one of the best ideas I've ever seen. I highly recommend these."
positive,6/7/21,"I found this Fajita sauce and the related Chimichurri sauce at a local Global Foods mart, but after using the bottles up, my wife recycled them and I had forgotten the brand name.  So I spent the next 6 months looking for them ever time we went grocery shopping - apparently the local mart stopped carrying them.  Needless to say, I bought lots of Chimichurri sauce brands - most of which were not nearly as delicious as I recalled this brand to be - until on a whim I looked up ""chimichurri"" here on Amazon.  Needless to say, as soon as I saw the World Harbors label, I recognized the brand again! :-)<br /><br />Anyway, whenever I make burritos or tacos, I add either the chimichurri or fajita sauce and my family & guests now think I should go into the restaurant business! :-P"
negative,18/6/21,"I am shocked at the positive reviews for this tea. It is almost completely tasteless, just a slight fruity flavour, it does not resemble any green tea that I have bought in the past when living in Japan or from Asian markets in the USA. There is not a hint of green colour in the tea and the leaf is dry, large and not compacted at all in the bag. In fact, the leaves are too big to fit in a tea ball.<br />Does this tea really contain more antioxidants and polyphenols? Can not find substantiation from USDA.<br />They talk a good talk but product is severely lacking."
negative,7/7/21,"Coffee was burnt, had a bad aftertaste, and very acidic.  note sure if a bad batch but this was not good coffee."
positive,27/7/21,im deployed in kuwait and ordered this for our cookouts we have every now and then. arrived fairly fast in about 2 weeks( about average for mail to kuwait) it has really improved the quality our our steaks. i love this stuff
positive,13/7/21,"The coffee is very flavorful.  I'd prefer a medium roast if it were available but this coffee is still very good.  The price is also exceptional."
positive,13/9/21,"This is one of the easiest coconut oils to cook and bake with. The taste is not very strong so that you can cook non dessert like food with it as well.  I use it for almost everything. Food, skin, hair etc."
positive,7/9/21,I love this coconut oil. It adds a great coconut flavor to baked goods. I love the coconut smell when I use it as lotion or hair conditioner. Tastes good and so healthy for you too! Good bargain when you get free shipping through Amazon.
positive,17/4/21,"These sandwhich crackers are very good. The whole family loves them, and they are healthy compared to what is in the store."
positive,10/3/21,"This is a great cornbread mix!  I don't eat gluten products & it can be difficult to find good non-gluten muffin mixes.  This is so yummy, especially when you add honey (a variation of the recipe written on the package).  I eat it all of the time! : )"
positive,17/4/21,"I had been making my own homemade taco seasoning, but it is time consuming.  Being health-conscious, I didn't want to purchase any more products that contained ingredients I couldn't pronounce.  I am glad I found this taco seasoning as we cook taco/burrito meat generally about once each week, if not more.  Organic is best and the taste is wonderful."
positive,21/1/21,"I have made this a couple times. I use the recipe on the back that includes chicken. I love the subtle lime flavor. My husband worried because it was Thai that it would be spicy, but it has just the right amount of flavors."
positive,30/1/21,"i like the taste no way to tell if it works for diabetes yet. i haven't taken it long enough"
positive,13/2/21,"I got a pack of these for free with my last order! Thanks Pier Mall! Very tasty cookie cracker snack, with a light touch of honey flavor. My friends liked it too. I will definitely buy some with my next order."
positive,15/1/21,I am not a coffee drinker because I dont like the taste. Cafe Mocha tastes great. Now I can warm up and wake up.
positive,6/3/21,"I purchased the Cafe Mocha when Amazon was having a sale on the pack of 3, otherwise, the regular price is much to expensive and not worth it.  The mocha was good, but a bit too sweet for my taste, so I mixed it with a small (espresso shot) k-cup of regular coffee, which made it taste like a mocha from Starbucks. You can also get the same taste if you use a k-cup of hot chocolate and combine it with a k-cup of regular or decaf coffee... and it will still be less costly than the Cafe Escapes at regular price.<br /><br />All in all, I'm happy with the product and would continue to buy, if only the price was better."
negative,8/6/21,"This product has bad reviews because it is quite horrible. Unlike most of the Keurig K-cups, this one tastes very artifical. It is extremely bitter and not sweet. It seems like it has excess cocoa and artificial sweetner, yet all watered down."
positive,7/1/21,"We use this ketchup all the time at our house in order to cut down on sugar.  It tastes just like the regular ketchup to us.  The bottle with the wide head is handy, because you can easily store it upside down.  That makes it easier to squirt out the remaining ketchup."
positive,17/4/21,"Saw these featured on Hungry Girl and decided to order them for my office snack drawer. The bars have a decent amount of fiber and protein compared to others that contain mostly sugar.<br /><br />They taste delicious. Not too sweet, not too sticky, not too chewy. The peanut butter flavor is not overwhelming. I like these better than my old favorite snack bars(Quaker's crunchy granola bars) and way better than a protein bar taste-wise.<br /><br />Although they are not too sweet I imagine kids will also love them."
negative,10/3/21,"I did not like the taste of this hot chocolate and my kids didn't either.  I will not buy again."
negative,14/1/21,"Tastes terrible. I should have known given that it was on sale but I am throwing the rest of the case out, I have tried it twice now and once poured it out thinking I had a bad one and the 2nd time bearly held it down."
positive,24/5/21,This spagetti sauce is really good.  The spinach is amazing taste to it.  You will love this and enjoy it time and time again.  Also for those (like me) whom are alergic to onions there are none in it.  Enjoy
positive,14/10/21,I run an animal hospital and the dogs loves this dog food. My dog loves it too. I give a little canned on top of the dry food and the dogs love it. The chunks are a good size and it keeps the dogs stool regular.
positive,7/2/21,"These are really tasty, organic and perfect for a quick on the go snack.  I'd always prefer the actual fruit, but if I don't have time for it and just need a snack, this is good.  70 calories, 0 fat, 5mg sodium, 16g total carbos, 9g sugar."
positive,29/3/21,"I got the Sour Apple version of the Clif Kid Twisted fruit, and even though I'm not a ""Kid"" exactly, I still take these to work for lunch.  They do taste good.  The first two ingredients are Apple Puree and Apple Juice, and the rest of the ingredients are added vitamins & minerals (plus pectin and wax to give the juice and puree structure).  Yes I know, these are full of sugar - apple juice concentrate is another way of saying ""sugar - apple flavored"".  But as far as a sugary treat goes, this one at least has some vitamins and even a smidge of fiber hidden inside.  It's tasty and I get my candy craving out of the way.  It's mostly organic, so I don't have to worry about my treat putting pesticides into the environment.  Maybe a real apple is better for you, but this will do in a pinch."
positive,17/4/21,"Ordered these for my daughter and ended up sharing them with my autistic niece who is on a gluten free, dairy free, dye free diet.  No dairy, no gluten and no food coloring in these only natural fruit, a tiny bit sour but great tasting for entire family!!!"
positive,10/3/21,"This is delicious olive oil and it's a HUGE can! I bought this on lightning deal to have a ""dipping"" olive oil. It definitely fits the bill. It's wonderful for dipping nice bread in. I was expecting it to taste like kalamata olives, but it is actually from Kalamata, Greece and just tastes like regular nice olive oil."
positive,10/7/21,"I really liked this EVOO.  Thought it had a great flavor.  We used it in everything, but where it is really good, is in salads.  Great stuff!"
positive,27/1/21,"This is wonderfully smooth black tea that certainly wakes you in the morning. By far, one of the best black teas I've ever had."
positive,1/6/21,"Being from Europe, I absolutely love these... they taste great, and being sugar-free is an added bonus.<br /><br />I understand why some Americans may not like these, as Americans in general prefer sweeter foods than Europeans, but if you're unsure I definitely recommend you try them."
positive,20/8/21,If you are a fan of black licorice then you will really enjoy these licorice bears. They are soft yet chewy with a rich licorice flavor.
positive,14/8/21,"I am unable to find a sugar-free syrup that also does not contain sucralose or other detrimental sweeteners at any local stores. Joseph's sugar-free syrup tastes wonderful and fits in with my sugar-free eating plan. I also add it on my oatmeal in place of brown sugar."
positive,21/4/21,"Some pieces were kinda hard to chew, but overall I love this jerky. Taste is great. Price seems good considering it's dried salmon."
positive,1/4/21,"You can get it much cheaper on Janeskrazy.com! Love it! Works great on just about everything, especially steaks! I also love that it's All Natural. Can't go wrong."
positive,17/4/21,"Great tasting tea, with or without stevia. I drink it hot and cold. Product arrived very quickly. I have 1 or 2 cups daily.  I probably should have ordered 2 boxes!"
positive,10/3/21,Coffee is just as good as other Fair Trade coffees that I buy.  I have a One:One pod maker and these fit in them just fine.  I do like my coffee a little on the strong side and can use the pod to make a very big cup of coffee before tossing.  I would recommend this product.
positive,22/4/21,"I'm giving this 5 stars because it IS rice paper, and it DOES taste good.  There is a learning curve, however, to using these without tearing them.  My first batch was 14 (there were 26 wraps in the package) and I thought I'd bake some spring rolls.  I think I had splits in about half of them.  My 2nd batch went a little better, with only about 1/3 with tears.  I know I can perfect this with time and patience, and these are a really good price, so I won't feel bad about playing with my food!  :)"
positive,25/4/21,"Yummy healthy taste. Great as a quick protein snack. The amount of salt is perfect for warm and hot weather, when your body will lose salt through sweat and also the salt helps to retain water in your body. Give it as a Gift."
positive,1/4/21,I was able to get a bottle for $1.00 through a relay for life food sale.  This is the best juice ever!
positive,30/6/21,"Some similar kinds of flavored coffees have a subtle mint flavor. This is powerful stuff.  In a good way, of course.  It had a very powerful taste of chocolate mint, very fulfilling.  Much better tasting than similar products.  I highly recommend this."
positive,1/3/21,The Maxwell House Peppermint Mocha is delicious and easy to prepare.  My husband and I were both big fans of this drink.  A cross between hot chocolate and coffee.
positive,29/1/21,"I am a huge peppermint lover!  I am also a bit of a picky person when it comes to drink mixes.  For me, many end up being powdery and not as creamy and tasty as I would like.  That was not the case with Maxwell House International Coffee Peppermint Mocha Latte mix.  Once you find just the right mixture of powder and hot water, you are good to go.  The container states 4 tsp to 6 - 8 oz of boiling water.  Well, I always have a big mug when I drink, which is about double this.  Not a problem - I usually use 8 tsp for my 16 oz. mug and it turns out great.  The peppermint flavor is amazingly refreshing and so delicious.  It is not overpowering, yet is strong enough that the drinker knows it is peppermint flavored.  For me, this is one of the perfect ways to treat myself after a crazy or hectic day.  Curling up with a mug of this peppermint mocha latte and a great book makes a blissful evening!  I highly recommend this mix to anyone who enjoys peppermint and chocolate."
positive,17/4/21,"When I started eating these I did not even realized that they were sugarless and low-carb. They are so delicious. The only ones I've tried are peanut butter (I like both crunchy and smooth - don't really seem too different).<br /><br />I was baffled to see some 1-star reviews but when I read them I saw that everyone was saying that they LOVE these bars BUT got a terrible quality shipment from Amazon. So I should add that I only buy these in local stores - have never purchased from Amazon!"
positive,10/3/21,"I love these bars. The nuts with white chocolate are also great; not too much white chocolate so it's perfect. The creamy peanut butter is so good. It tastes great, smooth inside, and filling.  My kids love these too!"
positive,30/5/21,"These can be hard to find, and taste GREAT- so good that Amazon can deliver them so I dont have to worry about finding them or running out! Packed with protein and NO SUGAR! Check out [...] for more details!"
positive,28/9/21,I really like these bars.  The only downside is that they contain Maltitol and half of the protein is Soy.  I am not a big soy fan. Peanut butter is the best.
positive,6/5/21,"This is very tasty and has a moderate black cherry flavor with some tartness.  I understand others' comments regarding this having a slightly prune juice quality.  Kind of tastes like 70% cherry juice mixed with 30% light prune juice.  I attribute this to the pasteurization process plus it's not filtered unlike a lot of prepared juices.  Still, I like it."
positive,20/4/21,"My hairdresser has jumped on the Keurig bandwagon, which makes sense because different people have different tastes. This chai latte tasted exactly like a more pricey cup from a coffee shop. I was very impressed how quickly it was ready, the flavor, everything!!"
positive,20/4/21,"I get bored with plain water - and I drink a lot every day.  I tried the Cherry Berry Flavrz because I wanted a drink mix that contained NO corn syrups or artificial sweetners.  This product fit the bill AND delivered a great tasting drink.  Low cal, too!  Try it!  It really is good."
positive,21/4/21,"This doesn't have a weird sugar free taste.  It's the best and I always use it."
positive,2/5/21,This item has a great taste. I use it in my tea for a touch of sweetness and the essence of vanilla. Great stuff!
positive,25/5/21,"A coworker just brought these into the office--surprisingly good! Sweet and tangy with a good crunch, unlike dried pineapple but not too greasy. wow! Definitely check these out if you get a chance."
positive,7/9/21,"Eatting allergen free can be a challenge and sometimes boxed items have a gross taste but these outback animals taste pretty good and pretty close to the real ones. These make a quick,easy & tastey snack."
positive,25/5/21,"Dandy Blend has such a great taste [to me] that it is not necessary to buy any coffee when away from home, the packets work great.  I use a spoonful of sugar and a little non-dairy creamer that I also carry with me in my handbag.  I find I have the Dandy Blend mixture in the afternoon and it satisfies me.  I will continue to buy Dandy Blend."
positive,22/5/21,"As other reviews have said, this tastes pretty good. It's the best dried garlic I've tried. Mine came in the three-pack and I hope I use up the other two before they go stale.  My only complaint is that you can't unscrew the top -- you've got to use the built-in grinder or break off the top completely."
positive,19/7/21,"This is a really good and easy recipe. You don't only get the spices, but you also get instructions on how to make this complex dish. I made it first with chicken and then I substituted it with tofu, both times rocked.<br />For the price it's a really good buy."
negative,7/9/21,"This is an edit of my first review, where I said the price was a little high, but at that point I hadn't noticed that both my local Walmart and Target carry it for less than $9.<br /><br />So don't buy it here - though it's a great coffee. I use this coffee as a drip-grind coffee, not French-press or expresso where so many people love it. It's still 5 stars!<br /><br />This coffee is excellent: it's called a dark roast but it tastes more like a medium or medium-dark roast and doesn't have much bitter/burnt taste so common in such roasts. It's woody with a hint of a citrusy taste. It's a little creamy and earthy. There's a considerable complexity of tastes which reminds me of Eight O'Clock's Bocar Blend, but Bocar is not as bold - but it is around 2/3 the price.  Eight O'Clock's Columbian (my most-brewed in the AM coffee) is as bold with a little less complexity and a more woody taste, again at 2/3 the price. It most closely reminds me of Starbuck's Caffe Verona, which is a little more chocolately in taste and is usually around $8 for one about same sized bag at Amazon."
positive,25/8/21,"I have always made fresh coconut cake - filtering the coconut milk & grating the ""meat"" myself.<br />These cupcakes are as close as you can come to ones made from a fresh coconut.<br />As with most baked goods, if you let them sit a while (say at least 4-6) hours the flavor is<br />even more intense -- of course, they have lots of butter in them, so how can they NOT be good!"
negative,6/9/21,"I have been a licorice lover all my life and black licorice laces are my favorite type of licorice.  This product has been impossible to find where I live.  I have searched every store around but no store supplies black licorice laces.  After finding it on Amazon I ordered it immediately but I was very dissatisfied with the taste of Gustaf's licorice.  It didnt taste like the real black licorice but some artificial substitute and it was way too soft.  It didn't please me any more than the Twizzlers do.  It's just not a real licorice flavor.  I would never order Gustaf's licorice again."
positive,25/5/21,"After reading about Yerba Mate in Eat This, Not That I had to try it.  It is a great tasting tea for any tea lover to add to their flavor selection."
positive,7/9/21,"This juice tastes great, and even my picky two year old loves it. It is very sweet so its perfect for those moms like myself who like to limit sugar (even natural kind) intake and delute down juices with water."
positive,13/10/21,"I discovered this milk a year ago and I am now hooked on it.  I love the flavor; way better than regular milk.  Highly recommend it to all you milk lovers out there. I buy it by the case and drink it on a daily basis.  Thank you Amazon, for making it available in a 12-pack."
positive,2/10/21,"I brought a box of these along on an overseas trip so that I could start the day with a reasonable cup of coffee before I left my hotel room. Very good for instant coffee. I purchased the Italian roast & will do so again. Not as good as my French press, but much more convenient when traveling."
negative,23/9/21,"This is a poor excuse for coffee - even for instant coffee. I was looking forward to trying it after hearing good things on the web - unfortunately, I was disappointed. I tried this coffee using the specified instructions, and also tried using less water. The best I can say of it is that it is weak garbage. It is almost like drinking hot water - but with a foul taste that will leave you longing for a real cup of coffee. If you want fast coffee, allow me to suggest a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQSMPO"">Keurig B60 Special Edition Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System</a> instead."
positive,26/6/21,it is hard to believe the instant coffee can have the same taste as brewed one.
positive,25/5/21,For people who are Gluten sensitive this bread is a god send. It is easy to make with a bread maker and has a great taste.
positive,7/9/21,"We are not gluten free but my MIL is.  I bought this to have on hand when she came out for a visit...  and then never got around to making it.  We just made it recently to use it up and get it out of here, expecting mediocrity at best...  but it was surprisingly tasty!  It had a bouncy, springy texture.  We ate the entire loaf at one meal (with bean soup, which I keep wishing my kids would like, but they won't...  so they ate a lot of bread...) so I can't attest to its keeping qualities, but fresh from the oven it was great.  It smelled AWFUL raw so I was skeptical, but smelled good baking and tasted great.  I think I will keep a bag or two around now just as a way to have easy fresh baked bread for dinner.  And maybe one of these days my kids will learn to like bean soup.  My husband did the actual mixing, as far as I know he followed the directions exactly.  I may try some of the tweaks suggested next time.  It does call for an odd amount of eggs, that would be the only complaint."
positive,15/7/21,"This product is easy to make and has a great taste.  I just wish it was gluten free.  A simple change in the soy sauce used would make it that way just like the General Tsao's Chicken by the same company."
positive,3/6/21,"I like flavored coffees - those where you can really taste the flavor it claims to have.  Well, this one does.  It is delicious and you feel like you are enjoying all the calories and good taste of a cinnamon roll in liquid form - only you can rejoice because you aren't getting the calories!!!  I will be buying this item lots more!"
positive,27/9/21,"This is a smooth coffee with a good taste.  I don't like overly sweet flavored coffees and this one is perfect.  It has just the right flavor and it is not bitter at all."
positive,19/6/21,"Great value, great taste.  Nothing like a cup of Caribou without having to leave home!  Would purchase this item again."
positive,25/5/21,"Has a nice taste and consistency to it.  It is very slippery after its cooked, so it definately does not stick like regular pasta. Feels a little lighter in the stomach as well, not like a giant glue ball like regular pasta. Seems to be a nice healthy alternative."
positive,7/9/21,"I will start by saying that this is the first popcorn I've popped since I've had my machine, but this popcorn tastes great.  I seem to like it even more the next day!"
positive,3/8/21,"My husband and I love this coffee it has a nice smooth taste.<br /><br />Sets our morning off to a good start even though it is D-caf<br /><br />Delivery was fine, no problems at all."
positive,5/9/21,"This is great tasting ketchup. I waited till I found one before introducing my kids ( ages 2 and 3) now I don't care what they eat ""red dip"" with. Hubby also said he liked it better than our regular ketchup."
positive,25/5/21,"For a chocolate chip cookie, this is a tasty product. But for a source of protein at the same calorie count as a candy bar, this cookie tastes ridiculously good."
positive,7/9/21,"I've been fan of celestial seasonings teas for some time and this is one of my favorites. Something strange happens in the packing because flavour differs a lot from one box to another: the one I'm tasting right now has a lot of cinnamon, while others have a better balance of ingredients. Eventhough they all are great teas and the 5 star rating suits them well."
negative,11/9/21,"I got this tea thinking it would be a nice tea reminiscent of the kind of hot cider drink you might get from a coffee shop.  What I got was a rather unpleasant experience.  When I first opened the box at work, my co-workers said this tea smelled like the cinnamon chewing gum ""Big Red"".  When I got to the first sip I encountered the sweet flavor of the apples before I was quickly overwhelmed by the very bitter taste of cinnamon.  It felt like two siblings who were not on good terms with each other.  Face-scrunching ensued.  I will not be finishing this box."
positive,13/7/21,Love this cheese. I use 2-3 of these containers per year. Refrigerate once opened and it will last till the expiration date.
negative,22/7/21,This product was very tasteless and boring. I felt like I was eating packaging material..awful awful awful awful!!!!!! Very bland!!!
positive,22/6/21,"Our kids love them and I've been known to sneak a few here and there too.  All natural/organic ingredients, names you can pronounce and know what these are made out of, no hydrogentated oils or high fructose corn syrup.  It's nice to have the variety of flavours too."
positive,28/7/21,While it is a bit pricey. I enjoyed this water as a nice alternative to just plain water. I enjoyed the flavoring of the Watermelon. It made it easier to make sure that I am hydrated.
positive,13/10/21,"A neat package, cheap, of very tasty, lichee flavored gummy candy. Each piece of candy packed on it's own guarantees the freshness. Yummy."
positive,19/2/21,"I like these sausages better than other products from this company.  Yes, they are a little expensive but worth it.  I'v tried them boiled, fried and grilled with excellent result -- highly recommended.  Check for specials for free shipping since it saves about 20% off the total price."
positive,14/12/20,I had a friend from Canada who always used to send these to me.  But unfortunately she moved and could no longer send them to me.  These taste just like the ones I used to get.  They are my candy bars!!
positive,14/12/20,It is really good and delicious! I would buy it again and recommend it. Really tasty. Thank you. Good product!
positive,19/2/21,Special K bar is a quick fix to a sweet tooth without a lot of calories involved.
positive,10/1/21,"This is my favorite tea of all brands and all flavors. I drink it cold with no sweeteners of any kind.<br />Of course everyone's preferences for food and drinks are different so well someone may say they dont like..."
positive,26/3/21,I love this product. The taste is great and it is very easy to prepare. My family loves this product.
negative,24/3/21,"I opened my box hoping for a great snack-to-go and what a dissappointment! It tastes like the fat is rancid in these. I opened another box to see if maybe I got a bad box but they were just as awful. My dog won't even eat them."
positive,24/2/21,"This is the best rub I have ever used. My aunt turned me onto it and I wouldn't use anything else on my Prime Rib, Filet Minon or any beef. It's the bomb!"
positive,19/2/21,"I originally found this product in a specialty shop in Monterey and am so glad to have found it here! Great fresh garlic flavor. I love it on steaks but the wife likes it on fish. Actually no fat but you'd never know it. Very versatile."
positive,14/12/20,Not the best rice ever but pretty good.  Have not seen it in any stores around my area so I would probably order this again.
positive,19/10/21,"I was hoping to get a great price, on these with subscibe and save, but I'll wait until they do. I drink these all of the time but wait to buy them when it's $1 a bottle."
positive,18/5/21,I bought these thinking they would be a handy emergency meal but found that they have a great taste.  I have tried adding a little hot sauce and a little Worcestershire sauce. Wow. Even better. The 8 oz cans are very convenient. I recommend these to anyone wanting something smaller than the usual 15-16 oz can.
positive,19/2/21,"I purchased their Matcha Green Tea Powder Cafe Grade a while back and I fell in love with it. Their powder comes in this little cute reusable tin. The taste of the tea is smooth and not bitter.<br /><br />I make green tea milkshakes and it is the best that I have purchased. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I wish they offer their cafe grade powder in a bigger can. I use to work in a cafe where we had green tea powder in foil bags and they didn't seal well and when we opened the bag we would be covered in green powder and it was such a waste. Plus I really like the tin and want it in a bigger size."
positive,14/12/20,This is a great tasting pod- we drink it alone or make a double cup by brewing it with donut shop or vanilla to create a new flavor.
positive,1/6/21,Very tender meats. Sole is awesome! Good value. I order a lot of Omaha Steak products and have loved them all.
positive,1/4/21,"Fantastic, juicy and tender!<br />Everything was great...is great (there is only the 2 of us) but next time I may even order with the desserts included."
positive,15/4/21,"I don't usually like rice cakes but these have a nice taste and are very filling.  The only downside is that this pack comes with so many of them and it takes up a lot of space."
positive,19/5/21,"These sunflower seeds are larger than the standard sunflower seeds you can usually find in your local supermarket (usually the David's brand in my area) so there's more inner seed to eat.  There's also a lighter coating of salt from the brine wash on them, so while there's enough salt to make things tasty, your lips aren't going to go numb from all the salt quite as quickly as with the other brand.  The shells are easy to crack with your teeth, and they break cleanly; also the bags are filled with full-shelled seeds - there are very few broken ones.<br /><br />I devoured the first batch I ordered, and I'm now ordering a second batch.  If you like snacking on sunflower seeds, I think you'll like these."
positive,19/2/21,"Not much you can say about water.  I love sparkling water, and the addition of some natural lime flavor is great.  Love this and go through about 2 cases a month."
positive,14/12/20,"Okay, so it doesn't taste exactly like pumpkin.  It does sort of have a pumpkin essence, however.  Maybe it just sort of smells pumpkin-y.  Either way, the tea is delicious.  My co-workers tease me about how many cups a day of it that I drink.  Personally, I like it with a packet of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0025UC2DQ"">Truvia,Natura's Calorie-Free Sweetener  1  Ounce Packages (Pack of 400)</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019LWUJI"">NuNaturals Nustevia Nocarbs Blend, 50 Packets</a>.<br /><br />As far as the comment another reviewer made about the black tea tasting like Lipton's, maybe that makes it more authentic.  It is said that chai tea was first created in India to make undrinkable tea bearable."
positive,28/7/21,"The taste is very good! Oat bran is much more creamy than one-minute quick oat (it just doesn't tastes like oat...). A perfect food for somebody on diet. Just one single tablespoon of oat bran would make you feel very full."
positive,29/6/21,"Newman's Own Special Blend Extra Bold is a great tasting coffee for any time of day.  It's flavor stands out even with cream.  I like strong bold coffee and this is my favorite every day general use coffee."
positive,15/10/21,"I had this cake for my birthday.  It was delicious.  It was nice and moist and fluffy, and tasted like pumpkin pie without the crust.  (I like the filling for pumpkin pie).  No bad aftertaste or anything at all.  We put a dollop of Cool Whip on top instead of frosting.<br /><br />We have had other Sweet n Low cakes in the past, and they have unfortunately tasted lousy.  This was a pleasant surprise."
positive,20/7/21,"I add this to the sugarfree cappuccino just to give it a flavor.  It tastes great, and does taste like York Peppermint Pattie Flavor."
positive,12/10/21,"My kids love this white cheddar snack, but it isn't always easy to find in our shopping area. This wasn't cheap, but we are happy that we can order Pirate Booty through Amazon. The 1 oz. bags are the perfect size for their school lunches. The taste is cheesy and light...love 'em."
positive,19/2/21,"Pirate's Booty, Aged White Cheddar tastes very similar to Cheetos white cheddar snacks without all of the calories and fat.  Even my teenage son (who hates anything healthy) loves them!  They're great when you crave a salty snack and don't want a b-zillion calories."
negative,14/12/20,I was hugely disappointed with this product. The Walden Farms line of 0 calorie salad dressings are great. This alfredo sauce is not. Do not waste your money on it!
positive,2/7/21,"I fell in love with these delightful candies when a friend brought them back from a trip to Germany.  A perfect combination of hazelnut chocolate, cream, and crispy wafer.  They are adorably cute as they resemble little hippos.  I'm not a big fan of chocolate, but this is a wonderful flavor combination and a tasty little treat."
positive,11/3/21,"add to aniything!! soup, salad, meat... brings up the flavor! nicely packed, easy to use. arrived on time - clean and fresh"
positive,10/4/21,"When I read some of the reviews that mentioned eating these tiny morsels by the spoonful, I was skeptical. But guess what I am doing? LOL!!! I love them!"
positive,22/7/19,"I really enjoy eating these bars they have a very natural and clean taste to them.  The only thing I would like to suggest is a less sweet version of these bars are offered, they are a little too sweet for my taste but that does not take away from my enjoyment of eating them."
positive,2/2/20,"I have a gluten allergy, so I am always looking for an alternative to cookies, muffins, granola bars, and other sweet snacks that I can no longer eat.  The Kind Bars are great - I have not found any that I absolutely don't like, but some I like better than others.  The Fruit and Nuts in Yogurt is definitely my favorite - I like the combination of nuts, raisins, and yogurt - it does not seem as overpoweringly sweet as some of the others. I originally discovered Kind Bars at Starbucks, but they were VERY expensive to buy on a regular basis. That was when I checked out Amazon's Subscribe and Save program, signed up for the Kind Bars, and cut my purchase cost by more than half - with no shipping cost!  What a cool program - especially for those of us with allergies who need regular access to products that are usually expensive and/or hard to find!"
positive,2/2/20,"The product was delicious and arrived in a timely fashion.  However, I did see them cheaper at one of those wholesale stores."
positive,31/8/19,"Good product, right amount of sodium, a little high on calories though<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034EDLS2"">KIND Fruit & Nut, Fruit & Nut Delight, All Natural, Gluten Free Bars (Pack of 12)</a>"
positive,22/7/19,"These bars taste quite good, although I agree with other reviewers that there is a strong coconut taste.  Fine with me as I like coconut,  I've ordered three times and the bars have been fresh each time.  I find them sticky, which makes them a bit messy if eaten while hiking or on a road trip.  Everyone I share them with polishes them off quickly.  Personally, when I look at the ingredients in Kind bars I don't have many fantasies that they are particularly healthy.  Honey is sugar.  Fruit and nuts are concentrated calories.  Healthy fresh fruit, vegetables and dairy will do a much better job of ensuring that I get the vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that I need. Gluten free might help some folks.  I do not doubt that if you eat little pieces of the bars spaced out over several hours they don't encourage glycemic spiking when compared to a Snickers or some other candy.  Otherwise I simply regard them as a tasty snack that should not be expected to be anything more than that."
positive,12/1/20,These by far are the best tasting gluten free bars ever and at a very reasonable price. Low in calorie and a great after work out snack.
positive,19/2/20,I love the KIND bars.  They taste great and are much healthier than other bars.  Also they satisfy your taste for something sweet so are healthier than eating candy.
positive,27/11/19,Thought I would just try this and I am glad I did. Great taste and the delivery was very fast.<br />We BBQ all the time and I now have a new favorite!<br />Well worth a try!
positive,12/12/19,This Organic protein bar tastes great.  My cousins told me about the organic dark almond chocolate bar.  This one is good too.
positive,26/9/20,"It's a spreadable jelly, sweet but not too sweet, with a flavor of lime. It tastes very good for a jelly and I'd consider buying it again, in the case I wanted to buy jelly."
positive,22/7/19,I love these nuts. I particularly like the cashews and almonds. A bit overpriced though. And once you start popping there is no stopping until the pack is done.
positive,2/2/20,"I bought this Hazelnut Paste (Nocciola Spread) at a local shop in Palm Cost, Florida. The taste is excellent and healthier than Nutella."
positive,23/5/20,"Recently enjoyed these teas at a high end restaurant. after returning home we ordered some more online , they arrived promptly and were just as delicious."
positive,22/11/20,"The black walnuts come in large pieces not whole or halved.  They are fresh, taste good, and I will buy them again in the future.<br />By the way, I read in ""Breakthrough: Eight Steps to Wellness"" that black walnuts have some unique health benefits."
positive,30/3/20,"I love this cereal. I've never been a fan of Cocoa Crispies but I am a fan of Erewhon rice cereals so I decided to give this a shot. It's so tasty and addictive--without being disgusting sugary like the regular brands--that I find myself eating it for breakfast and sometimes dessert."
positive,8/7/20,This almond butter tastes very good and it has a pleasing creamy texture.  I will buy more even though it is expensive.  It is worth it on my restricted diet because of the convenience and the good taste.
positive,4/1/20,"This ""water enhancer"" was really tasty and you don't have to use a lot of it to flavor even a large glass of water. The flavor was good without being overpowering, and it's fun using the little bottle. My only complaint is the price. At $3.99 per bottle (Kraft's listed price on their site, not Amazon's), you're paying more for the bottle and the wow-factor than the actual flavoring itself. While this is a really good product, I don't imagine I'll be spending four bucks on less than two ounces of flavoring and a ""futuristic"" bottle."
positive,30/1/21,"I just squeezed some into some water and drank. The liquid mixed with the water with little agitation. You can use as much or as little as you like. I did a 2 second shot. My drink was light, refreshing and not overly sweet.  It didn't taste like Snapple, for example, but I enjoyed it. I plan on getting more."
positive,2/11/20,"This offers a quick way for a tasty drink. Fill up a glass of water and squirt as little or as much as the liquid in the glass and viola - peach tea! Yeah, not really peach tea but still tastes pretty darn good. They say 24 uses but I probably got only 15 or so since I either wanted my drink a little sweeter or used too big of glasses.<br /><br />The current price on Amazon suggests more than five dollars a bottle. I think that is pretty steep but I would probably purchase some more individual bottles to try other flavors."
positive,17/10/20,MIO Liquid Peach Tea has a great taste.  The bottles are small so you can toss one in a backpack or purse and take it with you to add to your bottled water.  It is easy to add too much to your water so start slow and taste first before adding more.  I would really recommend this.
positive,22/7/19,"O.N.E. Coconut water is by far the best tasting coconut water I've had (and I've had just about every brand out there).  The great taste lets me hydrate my body better than regular water, 'cause if O.N.E. wasn't available, I would not be able to palate drinking coconut water."
positive,2/2/20,O.N.E. has a good taste for packed coconut water. If you are used to drink coconut water it is important to know that it will never taste like a fresh green coconut. I also make ice cubes with coconut water to use in cocktails and whisky. It tastes great!
positive,4/10/20,"This coconut water takes great!  I've tried many other brands, and this is one of my favorites.  And, I'm not sure why everyone is so worried about the expiration dates.  I just ordered two boxes from Amazon, and the expiration date is Dec 7, 2012 (so 6 months from now)."
negative,1/4/20,"I first tasted this product at the grocery store.  I bought the 33oz. container and loved it.  Unfortunately the taset of the ONE coconut water from Amazon was horrible.  IT had a strange taste as if it had been left out in the heat - it was a rancid flavor.  I will not be ordering this again, I'll purchase it from the grocery store where I can take it back easily and quickly."
positive,8/5/20,"This is the only drink that has effectively replaced the urge to drink diet soda for me.Low in calories and super refreshing at lunch.Its like I am on a tropical beach looking at the ocean (at work).Now that's nice."
positive,18/6/20,"I really enjoy this coconut water.  Tastes fresh and has good nutrition with no added ingredients.  I usually put it in our morning smoothies along with some strawberries, bananas and flaxmeal."
positive,20/8/20,"Being originally from a latin-american country, coconut water is one of those essential summer week-end drinks that we not only enjoyed as refreshments, but loved for all the no nonsense nutritional information our parents would throw at us about it.<br /><br />And though it's been a while since I've had a real hard shelled coconut spliced open to insert a straw and enjoy, this little pack did its job of refreshing me with that wonderful taste, and make me feel proud of the nutrition I was getting out of it.<br /><br />Packaged in a handy little container, it keeps the product fresh and with all its flavorful attributes.  Delicious, refreshing, nutritious.  It's definitely worth a try, and you long for the real thing but are far from a tropical beach, this might be your best substitute."
positive,1/6/21,"It's light and refreshing.  I've tasted fresh coconut water right out from the coconut.  The Western coconuts like the ones from the Caribbean are a bit on the salty side but the sweet ones are from the tropical areas in the Far East like Indonesia.  So, comparing this to the Western coconut water, it's way better and much more refreshing.  Comparing this to the Indonesian coconut water, it's below par.  All in all, it's still pretty good."
positive,4/7/21,"What a great thing to wake up to....I feel these k-cups are of medium strength, with just enough of Kahula.."
positive,5/2/20,"what would I do without amazon?? this is the only place where I can find all the keurig existing aND the price is great.<br />the coffee tastes good, does not taste like alcohol (!!) just coffee like.<br />good buy"
positive,22/7/19,If you like Kahlua this is a great coffee.  The aroma is wonderful as it brews and the flavor is mild - not overpowering.
positive,2/2/20,"This was the best ever fruitcake.<br />Loaded with fruit and nuts, lite on the cake, as it should be.<br />Not like others, all cake and not much in the way fruit and nuts.<br />The only problem I had is that it's all gone, and fast.<br />Must now order more."
positive,22/11/20,"I could not find this tea locally anymore, so I'm glad I found it at Amazon.  I've been drinking this tea for a number of years now, and probably wouldn't go back to regular tea."
positive,1/3/20,Lipton French Vanilla is hands down one of the most delicious black teas available - I am thankful I can continue to purchase it through Amazon since it is no longer available in stores.
positive,23/11/20,"this is my favorite lipton tea sadly all the stores in my town have stopped selling it so I have resorted to buying it at Amazon lets pray they don't stop offering it."
positive,5/4/21,"I like to munch a few nuts as a snack (in moderation, a lot better for one than eating potato chips). This is a nice taste treat.<br /><br />There is a smoky taste to the almonds, which is to the good. On the down side, there is probably too much salt here (unfortunately), since salt produces health problems for people.<br /><br />So, I wouldn't want to eat these tasty treats every day, but as a snack from time to time, these almonds really hit the spot."
positive,27/4/20,"I bought these Gums not knowing what to expect but as soon as i tried the first one I knew I made a good choice. These things are great not too hard and not too soft. And they are really sweet but don't taste artificial. Would highly recommend this product!!"
positive,8/3/21,"I went this way and that way for almost a month before ordering, and when I finally did order these chips, I wish I had ordered more!  I made the mistake of sharing with friends!  We all love this product and it is perfect for anything from snacking and dipping to use in casseroles.  Excellent flavor and taste; love them!  Nutritional value is not that bad compared to alternatives... but chips are chips, and these are worth it!"
positive,30/1/20,"I really like this soup and I'm typically not a big vegetable soup eater. The one thing I want to mention is that in the ingredients, I believe ""Yeast Extract"" is just another name for MSG."
positive,22/7/19,Item as described.  Texture of gummy softer than a normal gummy bear (probably due to size).  Very good though.
positive,2/2/20,Another great tasting gluten free product.  Has lots of flavor and because they are individually wrapped they are great to include in a packed lunch.
positive,2/9/20,"This is a very nice, full bodied coffee with a very delicious taste.  It's a nice favored coffee to wake up to in the morning.  I would reccommend this coffee to a person who likes a medium strength and blend coffee."
positive,26/1/21,"I am not a health nut and I had to keep an open mind with this product... but once I tried it it actually tasted really good. Just a tip, don't eat it by itself (not good). Try it with smoked salmon and cream cheese or make an avocado and turkey sandwich. Also toasting it for a few minutes will soften it a bit."
positive,9/1/21,"the dried mango has a very good taste. Very sweet. The chunks are not difficult to eat, like some other brands. the only ""but"" is the pieces are a bit too small to my taste."
positive,30/7/21,"I will definitely order this again. It melts in your mouth. The texture is light. When I brought it to work, the whole bag disappeared in minutes."
positive,30/10/20,"Good value, easy to dispense and they taste great.  My husband has them for a snack every day and has me reorder when they start getting down.  He wants them on hand."
positive,3/8/20,"I've been gluten free for about three months, and as someone with a sweet tooth, I've been a bit bummed lately at the lack of easy and quick treats I can find or keep on hand.<br /><br />I went to the health food store and bought one of these individually to give it a try. I opened it in the car and almost went back in for more right then! Only the rain and a need to get on with my day held me back. I will most definitely be buying more.<br /><br />If you like macaroons, these are fairly similar, crunchy but chewy, soft, sweet and tasty."
positive,29/1/21,"I bought these because I didn't get the almond balls.<br />These coconut nut butter balls tastes much better. My kid likes it too."
positive,24/10/21,"These breadsticks were wonderful with hummus and spinach dip. Wonderfully light and crisp with just a hint of herbs. I'll also add addicting! I rated it only a 4 star because the shipping was careless. Half the boxes contained broken breadsticks and I really wanted to serve them upright. Hopefully, Amazon will take note and ship with padding next time."
positive,24/10/21,A Great Coffee at a great price. I subscribed for regular delivery. Now I will always have the perfect cup just seconds away.
positive,16/10/21,"My wife likes flavored coffee and this is, by far, her favorite. Great taste. Medium brew. Excellent value too. We order this brew regularly. Guests enjoy this coffee as wel."
positive,24/10/21,"I have purchased many different brands of this type of fruit.  This is by far the best tasting of all I have tried.  It has no ""off-putting"" bite to it.  Many do!  I love it so much I cannot stop making my homemade pannatone.  I guess I can thank you for these 5 extra pounds!!!  If you use this type of product(I am Italian) so I do, I highly encourage you to give it a try.  maria domenica"
positive,25/9/21,"I bought this pack from Amazon as I had one of the flavors at the local market and wanted to try some new ones.<br />It tastes great. Make sure to follow the recommendations. Some flavors say ""do not shake"" and some flavors say ""shake slightly""."
positive,19/10/21,"Pops up great in the microwave (a handful of kernels in a brown paper lunch bag folded up and taped shut for ~3 minutes) with almost no leftover kernels.  I'm a popcorn seasoning junkie, but this popcorn is so fresh and flavorful that a little butter and salt does the job.<br /><br />It's also been my experience so far that Snappy is a little less prone to getting scorched than grocery store popcorn.  Higher moisture content, maybe?  Either way, it's nice to have fewer unpleasant burnt surprises."
positive,20/10/21,"I love the quantity and flavor of this tea. It's a little messy opening the pouches, the matcha can get all over your fingers and counter, but oh well. I purchase this at Costco, because the price is WAY better. My only complaint, is that I wish it were Organic."
positive,19/10/21,Great tasting snack!  Like viewer said taste like<br />Sugar Smacks.  My husband and I enjoy eating the<br />puffed cakes.  34 calories 0 fat awesome! Puffed Cakes<br />and a glass of fat free milk is good eating.  Thank you<br />Amazon. Jesus bless us all!
positive,15/6/21,All 3 flavors were very good often times with variety packs you end up with some good flavors and some not so good flavors but the whole family ate all 3 flavors up in no time.
positive,4/8/21,"I am very pleased with this sherry vinegar.  It is a little costly but has a wonderful,robust taste and really makes a tasty vinegrette."
positive,4/8/21,These go great for movie watching with the kids at home. The amount of the candies sold here will last for many movie nights!
positive,18/7/21,"tasty and soft.  my toddler just loves them.  they are a little pricey, and there are very few fruit snacks in a bag."
positive,18/10/21,"Its a great tasting energy boost.  I've tried a few of the energy drinks out there and never liked the taste or the jittery feeling I got.  I highly recommend the Raspberry Acai drink!"
positive,15/6/21,"I bought this salt on a lark because I didn't want to drive 40 miles to the nearest store that carried natural sea salt but I will buy it again.  The flavor is wonderful.  I'm not a big salt eater, never have been, just don't like the taste of commercial salt but this sea salt is wonderful.  I real winner that enhances the flavor of food instead of covering it up as regular salt does."
positive,4/8/21,"Good quality rice. Cooks well, and has a good overall flavor. No need to rinse first as with most Asian rice."
positive,8/6/21,"I have been looking for gluten free plain crackers for ages. Being pregnant, all I wanted in my first trimester was some plain crackers, but I thought I had no options being Celiac; there's some nice rice crackers out there, but they all are flavored with onion, garlic, BBQ, etc- not things you want during pregnancy! I found these recently in a local (high end) grocery store and was so happy to see ""plain"". I tried them and I had to laugh at myself for getting so excited over plain crackers. They are super good, with by themselves, or with butter, cream cheese, etc. They are great for soup as they are full of flavor and have a crispy taste. They are also not high in salt like most other crackers. Great buy too, I highly recommend if you, like me, just want some nice crackers without the salty ""flavor"" added to them."
positive,15/6/21,"Surprisingly tasty and a great texture.  I was excited to find these in my local grocery store in the Passover section.  My expectations were low, but these delicious crackers made me a believer!"
positive,4/8/21,"I bougth Yahuda Matzo Style last month.  I wanted to try it before Passover.  I love the taste and texture.  The biggest problem is that about a third of the box I opened arrived in crumbles.  I did not check the other 2 boxes, because I need them unopened for Passover.  I hope the 2 boxes arrived in better condition.  I will try and make matzah balls with the crumbs and use them as a coating or toppng.  At these prices I am not going to waste any of it.<br /><br />I am going to buy another pack of 3 so that I will have enough to serve during the holiday for myself and family members who can not eat wheat. I hope you keep this item in stock as long as possible as we eat matzah all year long."
positive,25/9/21,"This would have gotten 5 stars but I decided 4 due to the fact it is pricey and I feel it could be more reasonably priced than it is.  Otherwise, I was hoping it would be my answer to a saltine cracker that I miss so much due to being gluten-intolerant.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  The cracker was very tasty and had a nice crunch.  It is perfect to crumble in tomato soup or to eat plain or with anything on it.  I really love this product.  It makes a great snack when I just have to have something to crunch on:)"
positive,19/10/21,"If you are a coffee lover, this is the way to go. Grind these fresh beans and make a full strong coffee that is delicious!"
positive,4/9/21,"The Coffee Beans are great. Fresh, and shipped fast. Great prices. Will continue to order these coffee beans as long as they stay fresh and reasonably priced."
positive,31/8/21,"My girlfriend uses this product in her coffee to ""disguise"" the coffee taste.  Instead of using sugar, she adds half a package and some milk.  She loves it!  It tastes great on its own too."
positive,9/10/21,"We were eating a meal in Hawaii with some Aloha Shoyu on the table.  We didn't think anything of it until we tried some and found that this tastes really good - different from Kikkoman and the like.  If you like soy sauce be sure to try some of this."
positive,15/6/21,"I love how fast you can fix this Thai Peanut in the take out type of box just add hot water, ster then eat. It tastes great and is fast to fix. This is not the same Thi Peanut that comes in a regal type of box that is cooked in a pan on the stove top. I like the taste of this one better and it is easier to fix."
positive,4/8/21,I searched long and hard for this product and I was thrilled to learn that they had the exact ice bars that I was searching for. The customer service was the best and shipping was extremely fast!!! Thank you for making a hard to find product in the U.S accessible. And the costs were reasonable. I will definitely order again from this seller.
positive,15/6/21,"This syrup is an amazing addition to any kitchen. It's delicious and smooth and goes very well with chai tea."
positive,4/8/21,Great price for a great product!  This is much more subtle than green tea and tastes great with a little cinnamon.
positive,15/6/21,"Excellent product and excellent service from this seller. Lime pickle is a must-have relish as part of an Indian feast, but my favorite everyday use is as a garnish to tuna salad."
positive,4/8/21,"It was pleasant to receive these in good condition. The cups were inside a cardboard box while inside another main cardboard box with bubble padding, none of the cups broke."
positive,1/10/21,"I rarely can find this on the Keurig website, it's usually sold out, plus it's more expensive. If you love chocolate, you should love this. I recommend it!"
positive,1/7/18,"The kids in our son's party were super excited that they had flavors to choose from before I made their cotton candy..and what colorful flavors too! Cherry & Grape were the favorites. The cherry and Blue raspberry were the most colorful."
positive,10/8/18,"This was a good purchase. Tastes good, pretty colors.  Seems to go a long way.  I used at a family reunion with a bunch of kids and they raved about it.  I hope what was not used holds up for next year.  I put it away so as not to be tempted.  Very happy."
positive,1/7/18,"These sugars are so good! They make great, light, fluffy, cotton candy! They work extremely well compared to using hard candy. They all taste great! I would highly recommend these for anyone making homemade cotton candy! They taste as great as boardwalk cotton candy! :)"
positive,10/8/18,"Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers are a tasty option when you need a quick microwave meal on the go. With their compact, nonperishable packaging, these things are perfect for carrying to the office in your purse so the office cadger won't steal them. The pasta turns out just right, and the sauce is pretty good too. The Rotini with Zesty Marinara Sauce has a nice, garlicy zing to it. The portion size is just right for an entree; it is a little small if it's comprising your entire meal, but if you're eating at your desk, chances are you didn't have time for a full meal anyway. The plastic handles on the bowl stay cool enough to make it easy to transport this to your desk; no more trying to find the tepid spot on a flaming hot piece of microwaved cardboard so you can goose-walk it down the hall before your fingers burn.<br /><br />A couple of things lowered my rating by one star: for one, there is a bit more sodium than I'm entirely comfortable with in a product aimed at the health conscious, 600mg. Two, there's quite a bit of plastic packaging with this meal. It's nicely layered into a small package that can easily fit into a purse or briefcase, but when you take the layers apart, you can't help but think of landfills or the great oceanic garbage patch.<br /><br />All in all, this is still a decent option for days when you know you're going to be too busy to either go to the deli or make a sack lunch with bean curds to turn off any would-be fridge thieves."
positive,13/9/18,"My favorite cereal period. I enjoy this every morning with some unsweetened almond milk. Taste so much better than the similar Cheerios but has nearly twice the fiber. You can't go wrong with this."
positive,17/7/18,I love eating soba noodles and this is the best sauce I have found so far.<br />I just add some scallions and it is awesome!
positive,16/1/19,This price is amazing! We are a whole foods family and we use this for our baking and on our waffles and we love it! Way cheaper then the grocery store!
negative,16/1/18,"I can tell you from experience that it is not hard to make healthy, low calorie, low sodium soup that tastes good.<br /><br />Calories for this soup are OK, and it has a few carrot pieces in it for a little extra nutrition. However, the taste was totally bland. It is commendable that they used less salt. However, they could have added a little rosemary and/or garlic, for example, and produced an enjoyable taste without one bit of extra calories or sodium. I also found the chicken to be overcooked and rubbery, as were the pasta curls that they think are ""noodles"".<br /><br />Yesterday I had a can of Progresso Classics Vegatable that was the same calories, more nutricious, and full of flavor. Even the old fashioned small can of Campbell's Chicken Noodle is a better bowl of soup than this. No more ""Healthy Choice"" in our pantry."
positive,16/1/19,"Smells more like blueberry than it tastes. However, it make a great iced tea and sweetens nicely with agave syrup. I enjoy it."
positive,1/8/20,"I have opened hundereds ifnot thousands of cans of peeled italian tomotoes and for the money these are as good as i have ever had; as good or better than Campania pomidori pelati; very red, rich, and sweet."
positive,1/7/18,"These are great tasting.  It's like a mix of raisin bran and honey bunches of oats.  I did the subscribe and save and it really does save you money."
positive,10/8/18,"Over 11 years of gluten-free baking, this mix is the best chocolate cake mix that I've tried. I usually find other gluten-free cake mixes to be pretty dry. This one made very moist cupcakes with great chocolate flavor - I don't think I'd be able to tell the difference between this and a cake made with wheat flour. And they were easy to frost - no stray crumbs sticking to the frosting spatula. I will definitely buy this one again."
positive,15/2/20,"I was very pleased when this arrived at the door - opened it immediately & dug in - wasn't till later when my wife got home & told me it was for the dog, not me.<br /><br />Just kidding - our dog does like this Beneful, we get many compliments on her smooth coat, she's fit, full of fun & energy & very healthy. Dry dog food has added advantage if you have to curb your pet. Dogs do like variety too, Beneful has several different flavors, you may want to change it up every other bag or so. This 15.5 lb bag lasts about a month for our 50 lb Lab.<br /><br />Sounds funny for a dog to be eating corn, tomatoes & other veggies, the reality is these ingredients are fillers to keep the cost down. Other brands may be 'healthier' but are going to be more expensive. We selected this brand because that is what the rescue center fed her and our vet said this was fine."
positive,22/4/21,"Tastes great, no bad smell as others mentioned. Came in 2 days with prime and no problems. Haven't experienced any gas yet, I'm trying to build my tolerance slowly."
positive,25/9/20,"I really enjoy this peanut butter, it is sweet and a treat. It is not entirely smooth, it has a slight granule texture. Maybe because of the honey mixed in. Otherwise it is one less jar to grab, if you like honey and peanut butter."
positive,16/11/19,"I just started taking Benecol Smart Chews, so I don't know yet if they will lower my cholesterol. I am writing this review so other people will try them and not be afraid that they taste bad. They really are good. They taste just like a carmel candy."
positive,9/9/20,these chewables are delicious. Do not know about the results of lowering cholesterol...I will have to wait until the next Dr. exam. yum
positive,1/7/18,I take 5 a day and will update when my bloodwork is done again.  I am hoping for the best!  The taste is better than I thought it would be.
positive,10/8/18,"Product arrived quick and taste great.  Not sure yet how effective it is yet but it's easy to take."
positive,15/1/20,"I love the taste of the Benecol Smart Chews.  I'm hooked on these and my mom is also taking them.  It's great to have something taste good and help your cholesterol.  Thank you."
positive,1/9/20,"This product was recommended to a group of us ladies by a cardiologist who spoke at one of our meetings.  She said her patients were getting fantastic results taking this to help them lower their cholesterol (LDL levels).  My LDL needs to be lowered by 20 points and I don't want to take medication.  So, I decided to give this a try.  I have taken it for two months but it will be a few more months before I have my cholesterol level checked.  At that time, I will know if this works.  In addition to taking this, I've been eating steel cut oatmeal for breakfast and have cut way back on beef."
positive,22/7/21,Was recommended to drink hibiscus tea to lower blood pressure.  Hibiscus tea is expensive.  This is not as expensive and tastes good too. I would drink this even if not for high blood pressure.  Comes in a big zipper close bag in retail box. Best deal on hibiscus tea.
positive,1/7/18,I bought two different teas from this company and they both where very good. This was my first time purchasing anything from them and I was very pleased with the integrity and strength of the tea.
positive,10/8/18,"I really like Halter bonbons.  They have a genuine fruit taste and are not icky sweet like some sugar free candy.  Cherry, strawberry, and orange are my favorites.  I do wish they came individually wrapped.  They are often hard to find and somewhat pricey, but in my view they are worth it."
positive,14/5/21,"So I bought these when I saw a great deal on deals.woot.com about a coupon they had and I had seen them in stores a few times but never took the plunge.<br /><br />These are tasty, although sometimes a little hard for my taste, and a little higher in calories than I would like in a snack (200 calories per bag)<br /><br />But, it does satifsy my sweet tooth nicely and is much better than candy or a donut, and easy to tuck in my gym bag or desk drawer. The single size is nice because it's easier to do portion control than counting out chips into a plastic baggie.<br /><br />Still on the fence if I would order again, but that's because of calories, not taste. Taste is great!"
negative,17/10/19,"I did not like this product at all, It made everything I used it to make taste the same- horrible."
positive,3/10/21,"This syrup tastes very good.  Not quite as good as Starbucks, but comes close."
positive,15/9/20,"I use this every morning for the protein. Low calorie, lots of protein and I love the coffee flavor. Not a fan of the hot, but I throw it in my Magic Bullet with ice and water. Frozen and delicious."
positive,30/8/20,"This protein drink tastes great, and I only make it with water.  It's probably be even better in a smoothie."
positive,1/7/18,"I don't usually like protein drinks<br /><br />I DO love coffee and was looking for a good iced coffee mix<br /><br />This fits the bill perfectly - plus it's good for me :)<br /><br />I find the vanilla flavor very nice, the texture not very chalky, and the amount in the canister perfect!<br /><br />I mix with milk - never tried water - it might not be as tasty that way..."
positive,10/8/18,"I like this protein powder. On its own it is too sweet and has more caffeine than I should have at one time, so I mix one scoop of it with a scoop of EAS 100% whey chocolate protein powder and it makes the perfect protein drink for me. I use this product daily."
positive,5/12/19,"I've been drinking the mocha CLICK on a daily basis for almost 2 years now and was VERY excited to hear a new flavor was coming out.  The vanilla CLICK is very good and a good option if you don't like the slightly thicker consistency of the mocha CLICK.  I'll be ordering both flavors each month from now on."
positive,21/10/19,"I was originally using the ""Morning Blend"", which had a good taste, but I think this blend is smoother.  Also, the price is a little less, so it's a win/win situation."
positive,8/9/20,"This is one of the best peanut butters I have ever tasted. A bare minimum of sugar and exactly the spice level I would have expected. To the person who gave it a one star, common, that is ridiculous. You should have atleast given three stars for innate quality and being a product that actually lives up to the label. OMG spicy peanut butter actually being spicy, who would have thought!"
positive,22/9/21,"I was a little hesitant to buy the cocoa bean flavor after reading the reviews saying that it's not the same as chocolate, because most of the proteins I've been using are chocolate flavored.  I'm glad I ended up with cocoa bean.  I took the advice of some other comments to heat it up and it really does taste good as hot chocolate.  The other thing I like about it is that it mixes very well with water.  When I'm at the gym I don't really have a choice between water and milk, but it's not a problem with this protein."
positive,2/10/20,"Great taste, Ive tried many types of protein, this one was by far the best Ive ever had."
positive,25/7/20,"I bought my first RJ's soft licorice log today and it is absolutely the best black licorice I have ever tasted!!"
positive,4/7/21,"Excellent 'old world' flavor and style.  It has been years since I had salame this good or natural.  No MSG, etc.  Almost impossible to find anyplace else.  I wish someone locally carried it, but I am glad I can get it online."
positive,11/9/21,I drink this between brazilian jiu-jitsu and submission wrestling class to recharge.  Taste great.  Lime is my fav.
positive,4/7/21,This product tastes better than other coconut juices I have tried. I love that it is not sweetened. I would prefer it come in disposable cartons rather than cans but to me the taste makes it worth purchasing. I like this size also because the larger sizes are too much for me to drink at a time. The size makes it great for lunches and snacks too.
positive,21/9/21,"I discovered Think Thin products at my local Trader Joe's market. But, the per bar price was a bit high. Then I saw that Amazon sold them and had so many more flavors. I have been ordering them one by one. This is one of my favorites. I like the crunch of the nuts and the sweetness of the white chocolate. It may be a little too sweet. I like the darker chocolate with the nuts better. But, if you're looking for a different taste with the crunch of nuts, this is a good choice. I use them as a breakfast food mostly. They don't raise my blood glucose and that's good."
positive,11/9/21,"Tried all 3 'crunch' bars .... was pleasantly surprised with taste of each; not as filling as the high protein think thin bars but good for light snack.  Very nutty, sweet.  A keeper."
positive,12/10/21,These make a great snack. Not too sweet and an excellent way to get fiber into your diet
positive,11/10/21,the product is fresh tasting and enjoyed it. I had trouble with the lid which kept falling off and was soon lost.
positive,28/9/21,"Honeysuckle Pear is one of three flavors of Drink Chia. I personally like the Strawberry and Mango more, but this one still tastes good. Some of my friends like this one more than the others. They only have 40 calories and 4 grams of sugar, and contain lots of Omega 3 (880mg!!), Omega 6, iron, potassium, calcium, fiber, protein, magnesium...they are extremely healthy.  This is all from the chia seeds you can see inside, which gives it a texture that is new and fun to drink. The seeds themselves absorb more than ten times their weight in water, so when you drink them they hold onto it, keeping you hydrated longer. Great for workouts and sports. It's all in an 8oz bottle so it's easy to carry in a bag or in your hand wherever you go."
positive,19/10/21,"This is the best Waffle Mix around. Can't find in the store but glad that I was able to find them online for such a reasonable price......."
positive,4/7/21,"This tastes exactly like the white hot cocoa I've always gotten from my coffee shop...have I found their source?  Would definitely recommend."
positive,11/9/21,"Nice mild taste though there is a strong fish odor in the 'juice' - the cats loved that! there are a lot of bones and skin - reminds me of when mom would make sardine sandwiches... very tasty though and no after taste. and though no salt is great, I'm going to try the no bones or skin type next...wild caught is great too"
positive,12/9/21,"I am usually not the biggest fan of green teas, but this is really, really good. It has a third of the caffeine as an 8 ounce coffee with lemongrass, spearmint, passion fruit, and plum flavors. I was an instant fan, and the fact that it is healthy for your immune and digestive system are added bonuses."
positive,13/7/21,"If you like apricots or peaches this is the energy bar for you.It is completely natural, tasty, not overtly sweet and<br />the minis are a prefect dessert or snack size.Buying it on Amazon is the best deal I found for these especially with the subscribe and save option.<br />In grocery stores you are paying close to $22 for the same box."
positive,23/10/21,These little nut squares are delicious!  There is just enough sweetness to make you feel like you have had a real treat but not so much that you get a sugar high with a crash.  Nuts have protein so these snacks stay with you and give you a needed boost in the middle of the day or anytime.
positive,22/9/21,"I wish Gevalia came with an option for whole beans, but as pre-ground coffee goes, this makes a great Sunday morning treat. It may be a little rich for some people as an everyday cofffee, but if you like candy-coffee, you will probably like this."
positive,4/7/21,"This product is the usual Gevalia finely ground coffee.<br /><br />Full-strength it did not seem be all that great. I enjoyed it much better when I blended the product with 'regular' coffee. Maybe it is just the way I brew coffee that is wrong, or I have the wrong kind of brewer (basket instead of cone, like the Gevalia-brand brewers). I am not a big fan of flavored coffee, of any brand, because I think they processor can mask poor-grade product with fancy additives.<br /><br />It has very good dark-chocolate flavor. I am not sure how good a value it will as I do not have access to that info at this point."
positive,11/9/21,"I've been wary of trying this, since most people complained about the chocolate being quite tart. Thank goodness I gave into my own curiosity. My boyfriend and I LOVE this treat. It was originally for him, but once I had a bite, I pretty much took it from him and nibbled like a hungry mouse. The sweet blend of chocolate and strawberry flavor is amazing. I wish I had purchased more of these bars!"
positive,8/8/21,"Taste fantastic!  Somewhat hot if you consume a lot of it at once, but nothing to be fearful of.  It's the perfect hand-made taste hot sauce to replace your over-the-counter Cholula/Tapatio for all of you meal choices."
positive,9/7/21,"We love this cereal!  One of my daughters eats this every morning for breakfast.  I like that it doesn't get soggy so quickly.  I have even used this to make gluten free rice crispie treats!  We subscribe to this and a case arrives every month- at a price you can't beat!"
positive,24/10/21,I ordered the chocolate and peanut butter cereal.  I made granola bars for my husband who has celiac disease.  They were very good.  Even I could not help myself to this yummy treat.
positive,4/7/21,"Armed with her recipe book and flour blend we are able to make fabulous gluten free food! The only bad thing is we make way more desserts than we should because they are just that good! Not only are they so good that you can't tell they are gluten free but they are better than anything I have ever made gluten or not! Delicious!!!!!!!"
positive,11/9/21,"The maple syrup tastes really good and sweet. I use it in cooking and on pancakes. A good deal,I will buy it again.I like supporting a US family company too."
positive,24/10/21,"This sauce has a unique flavor and a decent kick. I like a very hot sauce and this is not as strong as my usual choice. It does, however, have a very unique flavor that I enjoyed. I have used it on a number of dishes and was really impressed with the way it jazzed up my homemade vegetable soup. I will be buying this again."
positive,22/6/21,"I've long been a fan of the Maxwell House International Coffee line, so I was excited to try this flavor.  If you are a fan of other pumpkin spice drinks at unnamed large coffee chains, you will definitely like this product.  I like that you are able to add the amount that you want, and the mix blends very nicely and evenly.  This is a perfect treat for a cold winter's night!"
positive,30/7/21,"My wife and I have been eating these for over a year and really like them. We slightly prefer them to Newman's Own, but of course that's personal taste."
positive,10/7/21,"I eat oatmeal almost every morning in the fall and winter, this is by far my favorite variety pack. I stock up when it is on sale because I can go through a box a week. The variety pack is nice because it keeps it from getting monotonous. Peaches and cream is the tastiest and nothing beats hot oatmeal after shoveling snow or walking the dog."
positive,4/7/21,"Second week in a row in the lighting Deals. Pick it up fast. Great taste, but very light after taste."
positive,11/9/21,"I received this gift box as a gift and completely overlooked all the other candy in my house. I am going through a total eighties phase right now and this retro candy was perfect. I don't know what else to say except that I love this candy gift box."
positive,20/9/21,"This tea has a wonderful taste of blueberry.  It's even wonderful iced as a treat for family and guests alike.  Everyone who I have surved it to has loved it."
positive,13/10/21,"I've never been a coffee drinker so I've always ignored Keurig machines. I got these since my office has a machine and really enjoy it. The tea tastes perfectly brewed. If you like English tea and have access to a Keurig, this is worth the purchase price."
positive,2/8/21,"As always this tea was quite tasty...but it was delivered to a home a block away that is vacant so I had to retrieve it...highly recommend the tea, use it alone but sparingly...or mix it with a black tea to mellow the flavor..."
positive,11/6/21,"As many other reviewers pointed out, this is a very spicy tea, with a strong cinnamon taste. It is absolutely delicious with no added sweeteners, and is the go-to tea in our house."
positive,2/8/21,"A friend introduced me this Good Earth Tea, which I found very flavorful the first time I tried it. I was glad to find that I could buy the tea on Amazon, and have now given it as a present to another tea lover."
positive,18/10/21,"I like corn and come from the northeast, where fresh, local corn is a common spring/summer side item, so I'd like to think I know from corn.  I tried a can of Glory's corn over the winter by way of comparison and thought it was pretty tasty.  Good stuff!"
positive,23/7/21,"The Switch Watermelon/Strawberry was a good drink. I thought it was a little too sweet for my taste, but not by much. One serving size was 8.3 fluid ounces. It contains 35 grams of sugar and 36 grams of carbs per serving, and each serving was 140 calories. According to the label, it contains 100% of the recommended daily allowance of Vitamin C. The drink has a slight carbonation to it that was a lot less than soda. The small and skinny can makes it good for inclusion in a lunch box.<br /><br />Although I liked it, I don't think it's worth the price of nearly $1 a can. But for the convenience of size, it might be worth the trade-off on occasion."
positive,8/7/21,I like this fqavor of this product a lot and if you want carbonated fruit juice then this is the stuff for you.I do suggest though that you refrigerate it because it does taste better cold
positive,11/6/21,"This stuff taste just like flavored carbonated water.<br />In this case Flavored with Strawberries and Watermelon.<br />I imagine it's better for you than plain soda.<br />I really found it tasty yet not overpowering in it's flavor as some of the other flavors."
positive,25/6/21,"Loved this drink. The sweetness level was just right, and I really liked the fact this is 100% juice without corn syrup or refined sugar. I didn't really think the watermelon strawberry tasted like watermelon or strawberry, but it was a really nice, pleasant flavor. The carbonation was just right. I also liked that this drink didn't leave a weird aftertaste or a lingering flavor on the tongue like some other sodas or juice drinks. This had a very clean flavor that was very refreshing."
positive,2/8/21,"I love the taste of this tea. It didn't induce my labor (only walking seemed to get the ball rolling), and of course I can't tell you if it 'toned' any of my lady parts, but I had a very quick smooth labor so maybe it did something. I am now 7 weeks postpartum and I'm about to order more just bc I like the taste of it. I enjoy this one much better than the Milk Maid. Super Satisfied!!"
positive,11/6/21,This company is VERY accommodating and was quick to re-ship my missing UPS shipped order.  The general manager took care of the problem personally and quickly.  This company definitely has my future business.  They have a fantastic product and even better customer service!
positive,9/7/21,"I absolutely love this product and most of the flavors.  It is not sold in stores by me any longer, so was delighted to find it here.  Much better than the same type of drink sold by the other big name company's."
positive,22/6/21,"I am surprised by many of the reviews that are here, especially those saying this coffee tastes weak. When I serve it to company, they often ask about it and can't believe it's decaf. It has the heavier taste of Starbucks which I love.  I use the normal amount for a greaat cup of coffee."
positive,2/8/21,"This is the best ham base (they also make excellent chicken, beef, mushroom, and veggie base) I have ever used. It works great for ham gravy and ham soup. It enhances ham flavor in many ham dishes, too. Made with natural ham pieces and NO MSG. A little goes a long way for making gravy. Highly recommended for ham lovers."
positive,11/6/21,"if you purchase this, your money is well spend . this product from Guyana is perfect and taste better than the 15 yr."
positive,8/7/21,"The only thing you're missing by eating this instead of wheat pasta is the carbs. It's got a really great light taste, the the bag makes a deceivingly large amount of cooked pasta."
positive,28/9/21,"Very tasty slightly smokey tea as appropriate to this type.<br /><br />A little dusty (thus the 4 stars vs. 5), but did not seem to seriously effect flavor.<br /><br />Would recommend to others for the price.<br /><br />Organic is a plus."
positive,23/8/21,"This is great almond butter.  I was buying almond butter at Whole Foods and the last two containers were watery.  I thought I'd give this a try and I'm glad I did!!!"
positive,1/8/21,"We can no longer find these baked Guiltless Courmet in our area stores, so I am delighted to be able to buy them in bulk at a terrific savings from Amazon.  They were shipped very quickly, and were intact and delicious."
positive,16/7/21,This espresso has a very smooth coffee taste.  I used it first in a press and then in my Mr. Coffee espresso machine.  The espresso definetly tasted better when pressed.  The price was excellent considering you get 4 cans.
positive,2/8/21,"I started Taster's Choice from Original Gourmet. After I bought French Roast, I found it labeled ""darker"" than the one I was drinking. I am afraid that it will be too strong. After I tasted it, I am so glad that it is the right taste for me. It is so convenient. I love it and highly recoment it!"
positive,11/6/21,"We've been enjoying this seasoning on our steaks for some time, but this packaging is an great improvement. We first started buying it at a wholesale club where it was sold in a plastic grinder. The grinder was a pain in the wrist to use. I'm so glad that Weber now sells it pre-ground in a shake-on container. Plus, the grill-lid shaped cap is a cute touch. I definitely recommend this seasoning as it's just the right combination of flavors for a charcoal-grilled steak. I'd even use it on chicken or pork, as well."
positive,26/6/21,"I love Taco Bell so I knew I would love this sauce.  I have used it on chicken, veggies, baked potatoes and most recently, I put it on my mashed potatoes.  You can use this in many ways, salads, meats etc.<br />The taste is creamy, rich and spicy but not too spicy.  it has a little kick to it and if you like jalapenos, then you will like this.  I am not a big fan of alot of spices and when I cook, I really cook plain but I do like this product.  It's not too much and not too little.<br /><br />If you want to add a little zest to your every day meals, this is a good way to go.<br />*************************************<br /><br />THIS IS AN UPDATE, 2 WEEKS LATER<br />Ok, for me, this sauce is not too spicy, however, I served it 2 times to company.  One time I used it as a dipping sauce for veggies and another time, I used it for a topping on taco night in my house.  Both times, my friends and family said it was too spicy for them.  I personally like a kick but they all found it too spicy but they loved, loved the taste, it was just too spicy.  One of my friends actually started coughing and asked for a glass of water.  So, if you like spice but not heat, this is a great sauce. There are many, many ways to use this and it really can stretch your budget by adding zest to boring ole chicken and fish.  However, it may be too spicy for those of you not used to it..but it tastes great."
positive,20/8/21,"I put this on some basically a chicken fajita and was not bad. Like Taco Bell's other sauces, this one does recreate a Taco Bell type taste which may be a good or bad thing depending on your perspective.  I still like Taco Bell's Spicy Ranchero sauce better.<br /><br />Despite being Jalapeno, this is not a very spicy product."
positive,25/8/21,"Just wanted to let everyone know that I have been using Crystal Light packets for most of this year. Ever since I tried one actually. I like the lemonade in Summer, but I like the iced tea year round, and it's actually my favorite. What I usually do is use a gatorade bottle (after it's been emptied or drank, of course) and fill it with ice from the ice maker, since those cubes fit, put the Crystal Light in add water and shake. Instead of buying water I just refill it from the tap and re-use the bottle. Great taste and easy to make."
positive,19/10/21,"This Maamoul has a good taste for both the date and the cookies<br />It's soft and doesn't smell bad because of the packing, I recommend it."
positive,2/8/21,"Good Quality, very tasty - Complex and smoky flavor, very mild, though.<br /><br />Break it up into bags and freeze it if you don't drink it everyday."
positive,11/6/21,"We've been using this syrup for years and now so easy to have it delivered right to our door. Wife is diabetic and we really watch her carbs (she's been able to stay off shots for 4 years now with products like this). We can't tell any taste difference from regular (we used to before the new sweeteners came out) We have noticed when we ask for sugar free syrup when we eat out this is the ONLY brand restaurants carry."
positive,22/10/21,"My wife introduced me to these - we bought them at the Japanese store in Epcot.  After we'd eaten the two we bought, I wanted to find them on the web, so I was pleased to see you could get them at Amazon.  This is a tasty noodle dish.  It's not what I first thought - a soup.  It is really noodles, with a spicy mustard, mayo, soy sauce mix.  It's easy to prepare as well - the ingredients are all with the pack and it just requires boiling water.  The container is pretty neat too - a built in strainer that lets you prepare the noodles and then drain the water without needing any additional utensils or bowls.  It's a little expensive if you just want ramen noodles - it's much more exotic IMO.  Try it!"
positive,6/8/21,taste just like reg animal crackers. i love them.. tried them from the grocery store first in the Mexican food section.. they are delicious
positive,24/6/21,"It's moist.  It is filled with all the things I love in fruitcake (candied cherries, dates, and LOTS of pecans) and none of the stuff I don't like. Best of all, it's available year round! I am also impressed with the service.  The carrier dropped it off on my porch last night.  This morning I had an email from the folks at Organic Mountain making sure I had received it."
positive,17/4/21,"The reason why I bought this because it's using HALAL beef. The taste is great, a little sweet and not to chewy. We love it and will order more later. Will recommend to my friends!"
positive,10/3/21,"I was so happy to find the Green Mountain Coffee Pumpkin Spice on amazon.com.  It is a seasonal product that I absolutely fell in love with over Christmas!  Some of the other pumpkin spice flavored K-cups that I have tried smelled really nice, but had absolutely no flavor.  This one fills the kitchen with that spicy aroma and has a full flavor!  I even run through a 2nd shot on smaller cup size.  It has that much flavor!"
positive,17/4/21,This is definitely my all time favorite flavored Keurig k-cup.  Pretty much tastes like a pumpkin spice latte from Starbucks.
positive,21/1/21,"I was apprehensive of buying a flavord coffee, I had a bad run-in with a cinnamon flavored coffee recently. This pumpkin spice coffee is very tasty. It smells good and it leaves my dorm room with a plesant aroma. The only downside to this coffee is it is a very light roast."
positive,30/1/21,it was great to find this caribbean cake here. Its truely a real caribbean rum cake. i was in puerto rico only 3 weeks ago for 10 days and I could not find a caribbian cake anywhere. Thanks to Amazon.
positive,13/2/21,These rum cakes taste really great!  I get them for myself and also get them as gifts.  Last year I bought one for everyone on my team at work. They absolutety loved them and talked about how soft and moist they are?  I am glad I know where to find them as I buy them all the time.
positive,15/1/21,"This is the best Rum Cake I've ever tasted.  The first time I had this was  in the Cayman Islands. To know I can stay here and still get them is even better!"
positive,6/3/21,"Moist, delicious with a delectable rum flavor.  It was a bit on the very sweet side, but overall a memorable dessert experience."
negative,8/6/21,"Recently, I was over watching the Celtics game at my friend's apartment. As the game grew more and more intense, I consequently grew more and more parched.<br /><br />""Hey Brian,"" I said. ""You got anything to drink?""<br /><br />""Yeah!"" he replied. ""I've got some lavender soda in the fridge.""<br /><br />""Lavender soda?"" I asked, skeptical. ""Where does a person even get lavender soda?""<br /><br />""It was sitting on a table next to a couch in the furniture section of Marshall's, so I bought it."" Brian replied.<br /><br />I walked to the kitchen, my interest piqued. Drinking lavender soda sounded like a wonderfully unique experience, as I typically enjoy the scent of lavender soaps. However, I would soon learn that drinking a flower-flavored soda would not be the exciting experience I had hoped it would be.<br /><br />When I took my first sip, I thought to myself, ""What have I gotten myself into this time?"" The initial flavor tasted like club soda that had been poured into a glass that contained soap residue from a previous cleaning. ""Interesting,"" I thought. ""Perhaps the flavor is just subtle at first."" However, as my drinking experience continued, I came to realize that this would not be the case. After I swallowed the soda, I was faced with an aftertaste that, rather than tasting like soap residue, tasted simply like soap. Like a bar of soap was in my mouth. This brought back horrible memories of my childhood...<br /><br />You see, when I was but a young boy, my mother would always threaten to ""wash my mouth out with soap"" if I either said a bad word or said something disrespectful to her or my father. Being one to always question my mother's conviction, I often found myself with a bar of soap in my mouth. This had a tremendous, lasting psychological effect, as even twenty years later I can still taste the flavor of soap in my mouth when I consider saying a bad word. Consequently, when I took my first taste of lavender soda, I was hit with a flood of emotions. I felt as though I had said a bad word or broken a rule. I felt as though I was being punished for something but could not recall what I had done. My vision began to become cloudy. I began to lose control of my small motor functions. I was soon reduced to a bluthering mess on the floor after being bombarded with such deeply-buried memories. I vowed never again to sip of such a soda as long as I shall live, lest I suffer another episode such as the one described above.<br /><br />In summary, this soda tastes more like lavender-scented soap than it does soda. It might be better suited for a more delicate palate than my own, but I, personally, do not prefer it."
positive,7/1/21,"Not sure if it works, but taste is good, like a caramel. :)<br />First got it in china Town, desided to buy again"
positive,17/4/21,"I used to live in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and learned from my relatives to brew and enjoy Community Coffee, preparing it in my little white porcelain beggin just like my grandmother and aunts.  I make my own blend of coffee beans and was so pleased to see that Amazon was now selling Community Coffee.  It is as good as I remember if being, particularly since I like a very strong, rich flavor.  I'm now using their Sumatran, French Roast, Expresso and Columbian to make my blends and am very happy with the results.  So are my relatives and friends who ask to use my blends themselves.<br /><br />Great coffee from the land of strong coffee lovers.  I'm moving on to chicory laced coffee now as Community carries it.  Personally, I like this brand much better than other Louisiana coffees."
positive,10/3/21,"I love this tea! It's so refreshing. I drink it regularly and was able to buy it on ""Subscribe and Save"" through Amazon, so making the price very affordable."
positive,14/1/21,"Over the years, this chili powder has gotten harder to find. It has been a staple of our family's chili for decades, and I am very glad to be able to still purchase it. It has a perfect blend of seasonings that requires nothing more than ground beef, onions, and tomato soup to make an outstanding bowl of chili.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A8SDCO"">Williams Chili Seasoning Bulk Mix 18 oz</a>"
positive,24/5/21,"I was unaware this is not a factory sealed product. That's the only con I would have about this product. It's high quality, tastes great, and a great value. I will purchase again."
positive,14/10/21,"This is a close match to sugar, and is supposed to be better for you than other artificial sweeteners.  A little expensive."
positive,7/2/21,"My daughter cannot get enough of these delicious snacks and I have a pretty hard time telling her no since they are made of nothing but pure, organic, pureed fruits!  The packaging is fantastic to toss into your bag for on the go too.  All the flavors are great and if you want to try them before committing to a bulk amount Starbucks now carries the line in-store.  ;)"
positive,29/3/21,This Organic Baby food is very tasty but has a very thin consistency..my son has to drink it. It is also very sweet. Nice as a desert but not for a meal for my 10 month old.
positive,17/4/21,This tea tastes fantastic! The flavour is not bitter at all as with other green teas and I keep brewing the same leaves about 3-4 times a day and still get really excellent flavour!<br /><br />The packaging was also great as it came in a sealable pouch that kept the leavs fresh. Will definitely continue to purchase this tea in the future.
positive,10/3/21,"It's always a matter of choice on what types of food you enjoy and this product is one of those that I love! You won't miss the taste of hotdogs anymore with this product and forget about the calorie and meat content, this is the bomb in grilling!"
positive,10/7/21,I received the chicken pill pockets for my cat and he loves them. What an idea!! The order was fast and the price was fantastic!! This is where I will order them from now on!!!!! Thank you sooo much.
positive,27/1/21,"Hot from the toaster, add a scoop of ice cream - I like chocolate - drizzle with some hot fudge sauce and a dollop of whipped cream - ooooo! It's too good. Not just a toaster pastry anymore."
positive,1/6/21,I was a bit skeptical on ordering a Spirulina bar.  It is soooo green.  I must say it is one of my favorites to eat before going to the gym.  Not grainy nor too sweet. It gives me just enough energy to work hard without exhaustion.  The small size is just right so no need to save half for another time.<br /><br />It is an excellent edition to a raw diet.
positive,20/8/21,"This cake was super easy to make. It tasted great and had an absolutly awesome texture. The ""mouth feel"" of the cake is nothing like most microwaved treats. Even people who regularly eat wheat would be very surprised this is a wheat free and microwave product give the taste and texture.<br /><br /> The texture is very soft and light and not at all grainy. The cake tastes like a cinnamon donut in terms of degree of sweetness and the cinnnamon flavor is very authentic and high quality tasting. The cake delivers a completely authentic cake experience but you should know it is not supper pretty to look at and does not come with any topping as might be suggested by the label art. If you are giving it as a special treat to someone, as a birthday cake for instance, you might want to spread some gluten free icing or whipped cream cheese on it to improve the aesthetic effect.<br /><br />This would be a great purchase to keep in the pantry as an ""emergency treat"" or to keep at work as a courtesy maybe if you are doing a birthday and it turns out someone is on a gluten free diet. Really what this kit is perfect for is when you are at a motel with a microwave, to send with a child going on a sleepover at someone else's house, or to leave with grandparents as an easy treat to give gluten free grandchildren."
positive,14/8/21,"I was a little nervous about this product when it was first introduced to me at a support group meeting.  I wasn't sure how any GF product cooked in the microwave could be edible.  But it was delicious.  I now try to keep some on hand for when traveling so I have a food option when the rest of the family is taking advantage of the hotel breakfast since almost everywhere has a microwave they'll let me use."
positive,21/4/21,"What is better than caffeine and sugar? This product blends great coffee, sugar, and cream to produce a little cup of paradise."
positive,1/4/21,"To see all the one-star reviews is quite surprising. Mixed with water, this stuff tastes great. I'm not sure what some reviewers are expecting, but it does taste like a good glass of kool aid. Who doesn't like kool aid??? Anyway, it's main source that will keep you alert is the green tea extract, which is pretty much caffeine. But it's a smooth transition somehow, not like drinking coffee or soda. Anyway, not bad at all if you need a little pick me up. Got lots of vitamins in there too."
positive,17/4/21,"Really good. I like it and I would drink this before or after a workout or run. My son who runs also thought it was really good. My other son did not like it too much. I can taste the pomegranate. The son that liked it gave it double thumbs up. I think it's light enough for an every day drink before working out. It has lots of vitamins and good stuff for you. Not so sure about that, but I am sure it tastes good."
positive,10/3/21,"I'm new to Green Tea, but I wanted to give these a shot after I got my Senseo machine.  I was pleasently surprised with the taste.  It is very smooth, with a light taste of lemon.  These aren't made for the Senseo machine, but they work just as well."
positive,22/4/21,"Excellent and with a hint of lemon.  Connoisseurs will like these small sardines, tightly packed (like sardines of course) in pure olive oil."
positive,25/4/21,I love these K cups they have a nice tea taste. They are cheaper than other places. I love them cold too.
positive,1/4/21,"This tea tastes even better with some milk and honey. By itself, it's better than average."
positive,30/6/21,"Wow, this stuff tastes great! It has a variety of uses and I am sure I will continue to find more!"
positive,1/3/21,"these are very flavorful fruit snacks.  My kids and i prefer them to others that have many more unhealthy ingredients.  they are pricey, but anything that says organic tends to be."
positive,29/1/21,"These cherries arrived promptly, taste great, and were completely as advertised.  We broke the package down into smaller quantities and froze them.  Would buy again, and will when the need arises."
positive,17/4/21,"These are very good, and a bargain depending on whether they are on sale. Came packed well, I don't taste the oil that other reviewers mentioned.<br />A great snack or addition to salads."
positive,10/3/21,"I was a little concerned about ordering such a large quantity, but the price was good and the reviews were good.  I am happy that I did buy the cherries.  So good for snacking and adding to yogurt and on cereal.  I have not used them yet in baking but plan to make some muffins with adding the cherries to the batter.  Taste, for me, is the right balance between tart and sweet.  After opening, I put the cerries in zip lock bags and placed them in the refrigerator.  The cherries are fresh."
positive,30/5/21,"These are really tasty, and not too sweet. We ordered another box. Great in oatmeal. They are somewhat oily, but this is not a problem, just a surprise compared to something like raisins."
positive,28/9/21,"It's my regular cereal now. Cinnamon is a strong spice so yes it dominates. Too sweet, based on the amount of carbs in a serving its higher than some by two or three grams but with the amount of fiber including four grams of soluble, the net carbs is reduced. Only knock here I wish it was available through the auto delivery service as this price appears to be way too high, its about $4.50 in the local store for one box."
positive,6/5/21,"My dog loves them, and we received them very quickly!  I highly recommend this product, especially to owners with dogs who love to chew."
positive,20/4/21,These are good chips.  I like the texture and that they are easier to chew than regular tortilla chips.  Especially good with some salsa.
positive,20/4/21,"These chips are a family favorite, I have a large family and we all love them similar to a healthy version of Doritos.  A little more texture and great taste.  Highly recommended."
positive,21/4/21,"I love them. They go really well with soups, salads, etc. I just wish that they don't come broken up so much."
positive,2/5/21,This is just another in a long line of terrific yogi teas. I usually keep a teapot full of this tea and add it to my (orange juice based) smoothie in the morning - it adds a nice hint of mint.<br /><br />I recently read that adding a citrus juice to green tea multiplies the benefits of the antioxidants in the tea - this tea goes very well with orange juice.
positive,18/12/19,This is truly a great versatile mix.  Substituting oil for butter and rice milk for regular milk works out perfect.  Using orange juice for the milk makes great pancakes and muffins as well.  The options are endless for muffins- our favorite is adding a bit of cinnamon and GFCF chocolate chips.  I also sneak in small amounts of light colored pureed veggies (baby food).
negative,19/1/20,"It's a joke that they market this as basmati rice since it is not even vaguely similar taste-wise.  Texmati will surely disappoint Indian food lovers."
positive,19/1/20,I have tried alot of Jasmine teas and by far this is the best I have tried.  Everyone I share this with agrees.
positive,31/3/20,I have 3 kids and we love this product.  Even friends who come over request it.  It is really yummy!
positive,18/12/19,"love the texture and lightness . the flavor has a hint  of nuts, altho does not have listed. my family loves them!"
positive,13/10/19,These are tasty.  Great Strawberry flavor.  Nice and crisp and only 100 calories.  I buy these on the subscription plan to save even more money.  I even ship these to my daughters!
positive,28/9/20,These bars are light and very tasty. Worth trying and I think you will like them. Even though I like them the price and small size of the bars will stop me from future purchases.
positive,16/11/20,"My dog, Ace, loves these treats. I love them because I can throw a handful in my pocket to take along on one of Ace's walks without them staining or making my pocket sticky. The coating on the treats is great for those of us that don't want to bother with plastic baggies. My dog learned most of his tricks using these treats as a reward."
positive,27/2/20,"As my box arrived earlier today, I cannot attest to it's health benefits (I'm not sure if I would be able to anyway)... but I can absolutely confirm that there is no taste."
positive,26/2/21,"I was not expecting much from this, a disposable package of self-boiling pasta with a bag of meat sauce. There should be no way it can work. But it does! You fill cover the slightly oily pasta with water, leave on the drainer top, microwave it for 3 minutes, drain it, heat the sauce, and mix it all up. And amazingly, it tasted good! Normally I can't stand this zero-effort lazy style of cooking microwaved meals, but this was actually really tasty. I would not make this a part of my regular routine because of the price, but I can imagine people who would.<br /><br />I have to take issue with the packaging, though. I am giving this four stars because each serving is individually packaged, and none of it is recycleable. The bulk of what you are buying is packaging, and it all gets thrown away."
positive,18/12/19,"I am a fan of Healthy Choice products and this one is good too. I've generally used their frozen food options but liked the idea of a shelf storable healthy option for lunch.  This pack contains everything needed for a quick and healthy pasta lunch.  The directions are clear and easy to follow.  The straining device that drains excess water after microwaving the pasta works well and the pasta sauce packet contains a sufficient amount of sauce for the pasta.<br /><br />This mixer takes a little more time and effort that a frozen option due to having the microwave the pasta, drain it and add the sauce.  However, the trade off of more time for preparation is outweighed by having an option that can be stored on a shelf or in a desk drawer.  A nice option for work or on the go!"
positive,19/1/20,My family loves maple syrup on pancakes and by far this is one of the best we have tasted. We love it!
negative,13/9/20,I have had martinis with fresh bleu cheese stuffed olives in the past and these are tasteless in comparison.  I could not distinguish the taste of bleu cheese.  Take the time and stuff your pitted olives with fresh bleu cheese or find another already prepared brand.
positive,10/7/20,If you like Graham crackers and you like oats and honey then you will love this product.  Just the right amount of each makes this a real treat to eat.  I only wish it had less sodium (130 mg).  Apart from that the lack of trans fat and saturated fat makes this a healthy choice for graham cracker lovers.  I would buy this whole grain product again.
positive,14/4/21,"i ate the graham crackers and they were delicious.  i shared the graham crackers with lana and she said also that the graham crackers were delicious.  both lana and i agreed on the strong oats taste and a lingering graham cracker taste, less subtle than other graham crackers.  i asked lana if this was a cracker she would use for the crust of a banana cream or key lime pie.  with no hesitation she said yes.  this is a wonderful alternative snack to cookies and chips.  lana is with me in highly recommending BACK TO NATURE GOLDEN HONEY OAT GRAHAMS."
positive,24/4/21,"These are some very tasty and sweet crackers.  They are a bit hard, not overly processed like some of the big brand crackers you find in the grocery store.  They are very tasty and and make a great snack.  I have not had a chance to make smoores with them, but I suspect they will be great for that too.  They are well formed and don't crumble apart easily so they are very versatile."
positive,28/4/21,"These are very good, premium graham crackers.  Delicious.  What else can I say? It is as good as a graham cracker can get, which is to say ... good, but not that great.  They are a bit pricey, about 30% more than a regular graham cracker ... is it worth it?  Who knows?  How much do you LOVE graham crackers?  If you love graham crackers, or have lots of money to burn, sure - go for it."
positive,12/7/21,"These graham crackers  are everything you'd want and expect of an all natural graham cracker.  They taste great with and fit right in with our family who go through a box a graham crackers on any given week.  These weren't quite as ""tough"" as our usual brand of grahams with a few more broken crackers and they definitely don't stay fresh up as on the counter if you forget to seal up the zip lock.  I think both of these are a result of the lack of random binders and preservatives from other brands and I don't think they really detract from the product at all.  They are great crackers and worth the space in the pantry!"
positive,18/12/19,"I liked these a lot. They had just a touch of sweetness, not too much, and are a great afternoon or late night snack. I was pleasantly surprised that something that is supposed to be good for you tastes this good. The only reason I gave them four stars instead of five was because the packaging left something to be desired. It was hard to open the inside package without throwing crackers everywhere, and they don't seal back up for freshness. I put mine in a ziplock bag, though, and they stayed fresh that way. Try them, you'll like them!"
positive,19/1/20,"These crackers are delicious, and healthy.  My 17-month old daughter eats them equally as well as the popular graham cracker brand.  I will definitely buy these again."
positive,28/4/21,"For being a natural and relatively healthy food item, I'm impressed by how good these crackers actually taste!  They're not as sweet as a standard graham cracker, but again, very good for what they are.<br /><br />I top them with natural peanut butter and eat them with a glass of milk, yum!"
positive,8/8/20,"I purchased this when it was about[...] for the 6 pack.  Found the deal on [...].  Great deal.  Don't think it's worth over [...] however.  Pretty expensive at it's normal price.<br /><br />This was my first time trying this brand.  Probably one of the best instant soup products I've tasted.  This isn't loaded with salts like most others and it taste healthy.<br /><br />My only gripe is the amount of plastic and waste caused by this product.<br /><br />Here's the ingredients / nutritional info if anyone is wondering:<br /><br />Ingredients: Noodles: Wheat flour, water, tapioca starch, vegan lactic acid, salt.<br />Soup: Soybean paste (water, soybean, rice, salt), sugar, rice wine, sea vegetable, yeast extract, onion, shiitake mushroom.<br />Toppings: Dehydrated tofu, dehydrated green onion, dehydrated spinach.<br />Allergy Note: Labeled as being processed on equipment that may contain traces of peanuts.<br /><br />Nutritional Information:<br />Serving Size: 1 bowl<br />Calories: 110<br />Carbohydrates: 23g<br />Fat: 1g<br />Sodium: 450mg<br />Sugars: 1g<br />Fiber: &lt;1g<br />Protein: 3g<br />Vitamin A: 6%<br />Vitamin C: 2%<br />Calcium: 2%<br />Iron: 4%"
positive,22/5/21,"We tend to eat these straight and/or with hummus as a chip substitute. I've noticed some variation between packages in the texture of the crisps. I prefer them when they're a bit firmer, but they're still nice even when they're softer than I would like."
positive,18/12/19,"I love these tasty snacks.  They have a great crunch and just the right amount of salt.  I am not sure I would call these a ""health food"" because of the fat content, but they are really good tasting, and I will be ordering again."
positive,19/1/20,"These are great.  I'm not a huge fan of vegetables, but I'll snack on these."
positive,3/8/20,"This is an awesome tasting snack.  The cheapest place near us is Trader Joe's and they sell it for $1.50.  Amazon is even cheaper!  You cannot just eat one.....we finish the whole bag each time we open it!"
positive,29/7/21,Great. Love these and happy that can be found on line. would love if you carry the snak size bags because i open a bag i tend to eat all; and the snak bags are better for portion control.
positive,8/7/20,"I really like Virginia Diner unsalted peanuts, so I decided to give this flavor a try.  The name ""Old Bay"" refers to the seasoning of the same name (normally associated with seafood), so if you are familiar with that seasoning you have an idea what to expect.  It's nothing like a bay leaf.<br /><br />If you've ever had Nabisco's Doo-Dads snack mix then these peanuts will be familiar to you - they taste almost just like the peanuts in the mix (and if you wanted to make your own Chex party mix, these nuts would be perfect).<br /><br />Like all Virginia Diner products, the nuts come with a foil seal which is tightly depressed because the contents are vacuum packed.  When you break the seal, you will hear the air rush in.  This type of packaging helps insure the nuts are fresh and crunchy, and they were.<br /><br />The nuts are small, and mostly in halves.  There are a few fragments, but not many."
positive,13/4/21,"I've always loved mochi but can't find it in Little Rock and didn't want to go through the trouble of making my own.  This arrived quickly and in good condition.  It tastes fresh and soft, not stale at all.  If you like mochi, you won't be dissapointed."
positive,20/2/21,"Very delicious.  Taste was 5 stars; ingredients why I dropped one star (added sugar!) but still, I would recommend this product."
positive,9/12/20,"I debated a while before ordering these because they are kind of fragile, but my shipment had no problems. Ha, maybe I'd trust Amazon and UPS more than the people they've got working down at the grocery store.<br /><br />Another reason I debated ordering was of course, the salt, and of course being ""SALTines"", there's a bunch of it. I haven't compared a lot of other snacks, but strangely enough these have less salt that other alternatives. I guess because there's no other tastes that they have to mask, the little bit of salt the do have comes right on through. I don't normally worry about such things as health and nutrition, but 12 boxes is a lot, and I tend to chow down on a lot of them because they're so good!<br /><br />Plenty of time left on the expiration date, 8 months from now, so that's not a worry.<br /><br />Prices, as with everything, fluctuate, but I got a good deal."
positive,1/4/21,I love this cereal.  I first had it at my sisters and now I am hooked.  I love the fact that it has good grains and that it is organic so this seems a good cereal (as cereals go).  I love the taste a little sweet and crunch.  And the price at $3.10 a box is really good.
positive,25/2/21,"This is a pleasantly vanilla-tinged breakfast cereal.  Organic and gluten free, at about $3 per 10oz box it may not be for everyone, but for those who need to worry about gluten, this cereal is definitely not a trade-off on taste.  I like the texture too, with a satisfying crunchiness that's filling.  I definitely recommend giving this a try."
positive,18/12/19,"I tried Nature's Path Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise courtesy of Amazon Vine and really enjoyed it. There's lot of variety in the cereal, with all sorts of granola and cereal-type pieces. I'm not skilled enough at forensic cerealogy to identify all of them, but I do know enough to say that they all tasted great. This is a great breakfast treat, and it even works as a snack if you are so inclined."
positive,19/1/20,"I had problems with the order, but I am writing this review just about the coffee.<br /><br />We buy this coffee so that every Friday at work, I can make a special pot of flavor. My co-workers really seem to enjoy the fun flavors of this brand, especially the chocolate ones. We will continue to purchase this brand in the future!"
positive,14/10/20,My teenagers who are very hard to please simply LOVE this stuff.  Will order again and again.
positive,10/3/21,"For those who love herring you won't find a better product. I remember eating kippers as a child and loving them,  grocery stores have a limited selection and higher prices. These are much better than I remembered. Absolutely fantastic and good for you. Inexpensive source of omega-3 and the fish are renewable!!! I am so glad I found them here.."
positive,15/8/21,"My daughter started eating these while she was 8month and loved them. They melt really fast in your mouth and they taste very good. Its not sweet but its not tasteless, it has a very creamy/milk texture to it."
positive,27/4/21,awsome taste love the bold flavor and individual packging already drank them all will order them again and again<br />rich taste wife loves the coffee
positive,24/1/21,"If you like sugar and tropical fruit, these snacks are for you.  They are small chunks with lots of flavor and they taste great.  My kids love them and I have purchased them many times.  Also good on cereal.  Sugar gets a bad rap, I recomend it for good health!"
positive,14/7/20,"I recieved this in timely manner. Was packed good. The taste is very good,if you taste it at all. No smoking if gets a little too hot. I liked the smaller bottles,so does'nt get old before using all of it.<br />Thanks"
positive,5/6/21,welches has the best flavor. it spreads very easy onto bread because its jam not jelly. my daughter eats it everyday. it is very good
positive,9/7/21,WE USE THIS WITH CHICKEN TOFU WORKS WELL WITH EVERYTHING WE HAVE TRIED.<br /><br />GREAT ON ROMAINE LETTUCE AN ADDITION TO THAI NOODLE SOUPS
positive,5/6/21,"Even though the price is always fluctuating it's always been less than I would pay at a grocery store even when that store has a sale.  In my opinion De Cecco makes the best pastas on the market today.  And Penne is my favorite because it's versatile, working well in many dishes, and because it's easier to make sure it stays al dente.  I don't think I've ever cooked it so long that it went to mush though I suppose if you really tried you could do it.  For many years I fell back on spaghetti noodles but then switched to penne never to look back.  I even use it for a less conventional noodles salad with mayo with a touch of milk stirred in and shredded sharp cheddar cheese and a dusting of fresh or canned parsley or basil thrown in.  With the `subscribe and save' ordering you can save another 15% and you'll always have this stable on your pantry shelves."
positive,25/7/21,"I found this stuff at a big box retailer not too long ago and gave it a try. I was happy to find it here at a better price than the individual serving at the store.  It is a great drink to grab as I'm running to catch my carpool in the morning. It tides me over until I eat breakfast at work.<br />I love chocolate coconut water and this is great because of the caffeine kick of the coffee."
positive,13/7/21,"All the Wylers singles to go are great!  They taste good and mix easily in bottled water.  Most places are overcharging for this item.  Walgreen's sells a package of 8 for $1.00 (or less; It was $0.59 a package of 8 over memorial day).  Most of my boxes had printing on the box indicating $1.00 per box.  I see some places charging over $2 per box.  At that rate, you can buy a 12 ounce can of soda (even big brands when they are on special,) and you get the can and the water included! So why spend that much just for the powder?"
positive,9/7/21,"I tried this for the first time and I loved it.  Nice bold taste, smooth.  The price was excellent considering what I have been paying elsewhere.  I intend to purchase this again if it is still available and would recommend it to people who prefer strong bold taste."
positive,8/7/21,"I eat lentils at least once a week if not more and these are the best I've ever had.  Typically, I just buy the pound bag of goya or store-brand lentils which are serviceable, but every once in a while I'll order these from amazon.  They really have much more taste than the generic pound bag of lentils.  They take longer to cook, but are definitely worth it.  Highly recommended"
positive,15/7/21,"As will all of Bob's red mill products these are excellent!  The cost in buying in bulk from Amazon is much lower than the cost at our local coop and I like this produce better.  Does not really require any soaking before cooking."
positive,6/7/21,"Well, I am neither British, nor British-born, but I absolutely love Marmite.  It is an acquired taste and one that produces very strong reactions indeed!  Their ""Love It Or Hate It"" ad says it all in fact.  As a proof of this, I have two dogs: one loves marmite sandwiches, the other one starts sneezing when she feels the smell of it.  My recipe for the perfect breakfast: marmite soldiers and soft boiled egg. Delicious!"
positive,13/8/21,"Twinings seem to have discontinued their apple-cinnamon flavor.  This tea is very similar; it's more apple than cinnamon flavored, but neither flavor is overwhelming.  It has a nice fruity tang to it without being acidic."
positive,5/6/21,"I don't normally write reviews, I can't be bothered. The reason for this review is this pasta is fantastic. I have MS and it was recomended to me to do a gluten free diet. I'm Italian and pasta is important to Italians. I now enjoy pasta as before, this pasta tastes like regular pasta. I have recomended it to my friends that are on gluten free diets and they love it also. Try it you will never regret it."
positive,9/7/21,"My wife needs to eat GF.  We discovered this pasta brand and it has been great!  My 9 and 11 year old boys enjoy it as much as my wife does!  You can barley taste the difference between this pasta and the ""regular"" kind.  A must buy if you must eat GF.  Note, b/c of the expense for GF pasta (this brand), typically, I make two pasta ""bowls"", this brand for my wife and the non-GF for the three of us. With the exception of Baked Ziti and lazania."
positive,17/6/21,"although a bit too sweet, i like the texture and the amount of choclately goodness in each bite  :) i do wish the brownie was a bit larger, but i like the automatic portion control, and the fact that they make a convenient snack for work or school.<br /><br />usually amazon has great prices on food items, but in this case they are half the price at your local costco. (where i was told by an associate there that they fly off the shelf)!"
positive,31/8/21,"I was a little bit hesitant to order this many boxes of potato dumplings without knowing the brand. It turns out that the taste and texture is very similar to the brand names,excellent! For an off-brand the price is too high, but altogether a great product for those who miss their Knoedel on the plate next to the roast and gravy!"
positive,7/8/21,"I bought this stuff to take camping to use in recipes and in coffee/teas.  I spent two weeks in the woods and was really glad I bought this item.  It works great and as far as I know there's nothing weird in it unlike most powdered coffee creamers.  It does take a little longer to completely mix in but it's way better.  Note that this is not a milk substitute.  It is a superb cream replacement."
positive,6/9/21,"I really like this jerky. The Plain Jane is really good, but so is the Ginger flavor. I'm eyeballing the El Diablo right now...ah yes, the hot stuff...my favorite. This jerky isn't dry, like some...its moist, without being heavy, so its a great deal, as far as price per pound."
positive,5/6/21,"We had an Easters party and i purchase this product to fill my pinata , The kids was surprised and happy with the candy's ."
positive,9/7/21,"These nuts are the best, great large size bag for partys.  Really the best nuts i have ever eaten, highly reccommend!"
positive,19/6/21,"Does not mix well by hand, but my sweet wife has a hand-held electric shake mixer to do the job.  She uses 1/2 cup less than recommended per gallon and it still taste rich and great.  She also uses it to make yogurt and it works great at this also. So far the 'SS' price has been steady (not risen) for the past 4 or 5 months that we have been receiving it.  Thanks Amazon and thanks Mr. Bob."
positive,5/9/21,"Mixing takes a few minutes, but time worth spent. Tastes great---definately superior to ""fresh"" skim (non-fat) milk. Love it!"
positive,10/10/21,"This is my new addiction! The best white chocolate sauce there is. I have a standing monthly order. Now I can enjoy my favorite white chocolate iced coffee everyday, instead of once or twice a week."
positive,29/9/21,I just got my coffee the other day. It taste as good as it sounds. I love it. Would recommend all to try it.
positive,11/9/21,"This is one of my fav flavors so far. Do not let the word CREAM fool you. There is very little cream to these but they are still very flavorfull. I add either French Vanilla powdered cream or liquid cream to this and it's great.<br />I have it on a regular basis. The flavor does not get old or eventually give you an aftertaste."
negative,5/6/21,"I never met a piece of chocolate I did not like, but this has an aftertaste I do not like. I do like all the other IF creamers I ordered but this!"
negative,9/7/21,"I've ordered several davidson's tea and they have all been exception. Except this order of decaf green tea tasted like rotten tea, maybe I just got a bad bag."
positive,26/8/21,"This is good stuff...nice to have for afternoon coffee break.  Sweet enough that you feel like you're having a treat, but it's NOT a doughnut!  Really very good."
positive,26/7/21,Carnation is the best instant breakfast.  it not only tastes great but it mixes easily and completely in the milk.
positive,11/9/21,"With the exception of home-made, these are my favorite egg noodles. They always cook up just right -- firm and tasty. I got them on an Amazon Warehouse deal so the price was better than getting them at a warehouse club (and far better than the grocery store). These are the medium ones which are pretty narrow in size. Good for adding to soups, casseroles, or just tossing with some butter and veggies.<br /><br />Came well packed with no discernable breakage in the packages."
positive,11/9/21,I buy this Tea for my British Mother-In-Law.  She loves it.  World Market never seems to have it in stock.  I order it online and treated like a king!
positive,15/9/21,"Excellent tasting green tea for those who want to quit black tea or coffee.<br /><br />I quit coffee cold turkey by substituting this tea.<br /><br />I was up to 64 ounces of coffee a day.<br />Now I drink 24 ounces of this tea daily. (three cups)<br /><br />Yes, I feel a lot better!<br />I have no desire for coffee anymore, but I do dabble with black tea.<br />No longer do I have to trust others to serve me fresh coffee.<br />Tea is always fresh, and you can carry a few envelopes of your favorite variety.<br />Just add hot water."
positive,5/6/21,"This is the next best thing to homemade chicken broth.  I've used this product to make soups, risotto and heighten the taste of gravy.  You may want to use a bit less water than is called for in the instructions"
positive,9/7/21,I love flavored coffee and Folgers is great.  Amazon has better prices then you can get at the store.
positive,14/9/21,"The whole family loves these crackers. I like that they aren't very salty. My kids love them - we eat both the bunnies and goldfish and they've never mentioned that they can tell the difference."
positive,29/9/21,"I bought this mixed Turkish delight Pistachio,Almonds & Hazelnut ,I took it to my sister's house for my nephew 5th birthday among his gifts everyone at that party they all loved it they said it wasn't too sweet and the nuts inside are moderate perfect portion.I myself loved it too and I plan to order more in the future it is the perfect sweet to serve your guests after serving them espresso coffee.amazon thank you again as always for bringing us the International flavors to our home without spending a lot of money for traveling to get these sweets,"
positive,10/7/21,WE RUN A CATERING AND EVENTS COMPANY AND USE THESE MOSTY FOR CHILDRENS PARTIES...THEY ARE EASY TO SERVE AND THE CHILDREN LOVE THE BOYARDEE PRODUCTS. WE CANT GET THEM FROM ANY SUPPLIER FOR WHAT AMAZON SELLS THEM FOR IN THE SUBSCRIBE&SAVE PROGRAM...AND THEY TASTE GOOD AS WELL.
positive,1/3/20,"I ordered these because I needed a flat sucker to put a round sticker on for a shower favor. I had no idea what they tasted like but they turned to be really good actually! I recieved exactly 4 broken suckers in the whole pack of 48. I didn't think that was bad at all for such a fragile product!"
positive,28/7/20,"am a carb watcher, and even though these do not a lot of fiber, find a couple of them satisfying to have with a salad, or just a quick snack//like the fact that they are a whole wheat product"
positive,28/7/20,I really enjoy these rice cakes. I put them in the toaster and toast them and put butter and jam on them and they are just as good as eating toast for breakfast.
positive,10/11/19,"great taste, good price... Always looking for some flavor to add to my tea muixture, this works better than most of the ones I've tried"
positive,1/3/20,Dr. Smoothie Crushed Fruit is great tasting and easy to make up with other foods that you like. I like the fact that it only contains fruit and no other chemicals or additives since I am allergic to a lot of food.
positive,3/8/19,This Vanilla Biscotti flavor is one of my favorite coffees. Great flavor. Is truly the epitome of curling up with a good book by the fire kind of coffee. Folgers does a great job on their Gourment coffees.
positive,6/2/21,"The Maple Almond Butter is incredible.  One of the best tasting foods I've ever had.  It is much better in the 1 oz pouches as you can simply eat it plain.  I started putting it on bagels and toast but the flavor of the butter gets masked by the food it is on.  My kids love it.  Easy to put in lunches.  Not to mention it is very healthy and organic."
positive,24/2/21,"I received this Bonomo turkish taffy assorted 4 flavors it was tasty not too sweet but perfect flavors too.I shared mine with my family my son he really liked it kept asking for more,and I also took some to my parents house my brother and his family were there too that day so are my sister and her family they all ate some and liked it too ,told me where I bought it my son and my daughter told them amazon she is at their website every day looking what amazon has new stuff so she can grab some and share with everyone they were looking at me with their smile on their face so they said amazon website is your second home you are there all the time I said sure I don't want to miss a great deals."
positive,13/5/21,"This snack tastes really good, I can't help myself eating it up.Although it's small in size, but I will difinitily purchase this again"
positive,1/3/20,"Make it hot, then enjoy it as hot tea or add ice cubes for iced tea. The varied flavors give you an opportunity to try out different flavors. Celestial knows how to make good tea!"
positive,28/7/20,"Despite what others are saying about these teas, they are DELICIOUS! It is the perfect amount of sweetness. The Peach ones are my favorite. The flavor isn't too strong, but you can definitely taste it. A lot healthier than drinking a flavored iced tea with diabetes amounts of sugar!"
negative,13/5/20,"Some are better then others, but overall they mostly taste like they have been chemically treated. I will not puchase this in the future."
positive,26/3/21,"Left a review for a bird feeder on this product accidentally. Sorry for any confusion. Great product, btw. Really enjoy the 2 oz packs to take into work."
positive,29/8/19,"This chili is pretty tasty (but only a little spicy).  It's easy to take with you.  There are two good size servings per container.  Each serving is 220 calories, with 9 grams of fat, 18 grams of carbs and 16 grams of protein.  I've only eaten it as is, but I think it would be great on nachos or chili dogs."
positive,7/2/21,"My fiance and I both really love this one. I am a salt fiend (bought the low sodium version because it's cheaper) and I didn't even feel a need to add any. I really loved it. Healthy, easy and tasty. You need to make sure you make it correctly though. I boil water in a kettle, then add the seasoning and a little water - stir it really thoroughly, then I add the rest of the water to the line and cover it with the spoon. Wait 5 min or so and then stir again before eating. Perfect! :)"
positive,14/10/21,"The nuts were fresh and very tasty. I bought them for baking, but also ended up toasting them just to snack on."
negative,7/8/20,"This was a gift and the recipient disliked the product.  Basically, a waste of money, as the 5 remaining cartons were never opened."
positive,1/3/20,"Tastes great and powder disolves with no problem. I no longer drink soda of any kind or caffeine. Just wish the powder was easier to find and more ""green"" - would be great if they sold it in tubs with a scoop."
positive,28/7/20,"This is a tasty G.F. product. I've been on a G.F. diet for 7 years so have tried a lot of different products and this is one I reorder. My only negative would be that it doesn't reheat well, but that's true of most G.F. pastas. Not a problem if more than one person is eating it. Nice to have some thing quick and easy to make that is still a hot meal and G.F."
positive,14/9/21,"I'm skeptical about the health claims of these cookies. That said, I eat them because they are crunchy and rich and delicious without being too high in calories. The chocolate ones are my favorite. These are really good."
positive,17/12/20,"I found these at BJ's Wholesale Club and really liked the taste.  They are very crunchy and chocolaty and the portion size is good."
positive,2/5/20,"DESCRIPTION:  Lightly roasted and lightly salted; with no added oil<br /><br />SIZE:  11oz bags<br /><br />EVALUATION: Excellent and flavorful, however some are under-roasted and not crunchy.  A few nuts taste stale.<br />> Blue Diamond brand almonds, moderately roasted with canola, safflower, or sunflower oil and lightly salted are more flavorful.  Although not oily, the roasting oil does effect the flavor.  Whether that's a good thing or not is a matter of individual tastes.  The longer or more intense roasting makes the nuts crunchier.<br /><br />PRICE COMPARISON:  At the time of this writing, both ""Back-to-Nature"" and ""Blue Diamond"" almonds are about 50 cents/oz <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSX4D2"">Blue Diamond Almonds Roasted Salted, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a>  The Blue Diamond almonds come in more convenient 6 oz cans, but may be less environmental freindly."
positive,14/7/21,"I search for this candy everywhere,candy stores no luck.i got them as a Christmas gift :) for my boyfriend. .he loved it"
positive,18/7/19,"This sunflower tastes really great, very original flavor not over salted. And the size of a sunflower seed is decent though not very large. Overall, it is the best sunflower seed that I ever eat in America."
positive,1/3/20,"I was introduced to this product by my cousin. Quick and easy way to give some added flavor to your rice based meal. Many different ways to prepare, but my favorite is to marinate the meat in a slow cooker for the day, then add to my rice in the rice cooker. TASTY! Wife was a bit put off by the pink color at first, but the flavor pulled her past that. Looking forward to tryiong it in differnt ways."
positive,28/7/20,"Quite good.  I would definitely order this again.  Nice sized roe. A little soft, meaning, not a lot of ""pop"", but still quite good for the price."
positive,13/6/20,I prefer the Saucettes but as they appear to be no longer available I tried these and have come to enjoy them just as much. These have a little better flavor but the Saucettes had a better texture. These taste much better than meat.
positive,10/3/20,"Good stuff. It has a better, more natural flavor than the Kraft version in my opinion."
positive,9/5/20,"You'll either like this double-salted licorice - and, indeed, other salted licorice available on Amazon - or you'll detest it. The reviews on this and other licorice products attest to this polarity among reviewers. It's an acquired taste that, once acquired, proves to be somewhat addictive.<br /><br />I have only recently become acquainted with salted licorice. I actually prefer the normal salted variety, although the salty kick - from ammonium salts rather that sodium chloride - is very strong and strangely satisfying in these double-salt rounds.<br /><br />I would advise anybody who is thinking of trying salted licorice to seek out a small pack of the stuff first of all. If you like it, go ahead and order one of the regular-salted <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015V7GG4"">Kraepelien & Holm Farm Salt Licorice, 2.2-Pound Bags (Pack of 3)</a> available on Amazon, making sure to take advantage of the subscription offer. Otherwise, you risk wasting your money on something you may consider inedible."
positive,14/5/19,"Was looking for a brand other than sense and came across Baronet, could not be more pleased.  Great flavor, rich and tasty each and every time.  Will reorder again that is for sure."
positive,19/10/20,"The sticky rice is perfect, just microwave it in the container it comes in for 2 min.  The paper thin wraps are very small and it is a bit difficult to roll.  The result is a bit of a mess but tastes great.  I put a small amount of crab meat next to the rice.  Each pack comes with 10 wraps, a container of rice, and one soy sauce pack.  The calorie count is 340.  But with 1/2 it is a reasonable 170 and is enough for a lunch.  I bought it when it was a gold box item for $10.  It is worth that, but I will not purchase again for a higher price.  Overall it is easy to make, tastes great and is a great option to have around since it does not require any refrigeration."
positive,1/3/20,"I was hesitant to purchase this, despite the outstanding reviews, because of the price. I mean, what could be cheaper than rice and toasted seaweed?<br /><br />With that perspective, I was very pleased with these meals/snacks. The rice was more delicious than the freshly made white rice served in many places (possibly even better than the rice in my house) and the wraps are super delicate and with a nice lightly crispy texture that is most enjoyable.<br /><br />If you like sushi wraps and rice, I highly recommend you try these."
positive,28/7/20,"These soda's taste great, while I've never had the original flavored I expect it to taste something like a sprite. Unlike American soda's like coke and dr. pepper these are fruit flavored and have FAR less sugar and sodium in them making them a much healthier choice of beverage; as healthy as a soda could possibly be that is. All flavors taste great and the bottle is 100% recyclable. I'd recommend them to anyone."
positive,7/3/20,"Looking for a delicious crunchy snack that won't go straight to your waistline? These paper thin - beautifully seasoned crackers hold up perfectly on their own and to any/all of your favorite toppings. Hummus, cheese (hard and spreadable), vegetable wafers (cucumbers, zucchini, roasted peppers etc), chip dips, salsa... I could go on forever. At 120 calories for 19 crackers (0 calories from fat) these wonderful wafers will satisfy any snack attack and you'll feel great about eating them. I initially found these in a ""Health Food Store"" but Amazon sells and ships them for cheaper money. Quality was as good or better. Well... that's what I think. Oh, and YUM!"
positive,4/8/20,"love crispix but don't like to have to go to the store often so I try online food shopping and for some items this is the way to go. Cheaper than regular price at the store for this large size of box"
positive,26/12/19,"I recently found out about these products and I love this breakfast sausages. I have tried the other product: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00304X2BC"">Cedar Lake Tasty Link, 20 Oz. Cans (Case of 12, Vegan)</a>, they both taste good but I like these better. Healthy yet tasty!"
positive,28/3/21,"These little links are great. Very healthy and delicious. Great shelf-stable non-meat protein source! I'm not even a vegetarian and I prefer the taste of these over meat sausages."
positive,6/2/20,"I was skeptical when i first purchased this because i got it pretty cheap and i'm used to buying pretty pricey stuff at the store.  But it's actually pretty good! I will definately keep on purchasing this, saves me quite a bit of money. Also, stays very fresh when kept in the freezer"
positive,25/4/21,"I love the taste of Total, and it's good for you!  Even my kids love it :)"
positive,3/8/20,"fresh and good for you.  swift shipment.  highly recommended.  I've been using this product for over a year now."
positive,15/4/19,"My first taste of Goji Berries, very good..generous package, will buy again.The breakout food of the year,even though they have been used for centuries by chinese cooks.Buddist cooks also use goji berries.Listed in Dr.Pericone's 7 secrets to beauty....I'm so glad to have learned about this super food."
positive,9/3/18,"My daughters favorite food is pears, and she also loves her green vegetables. Now both of them combined is the perfect combination, and they're the perfect size. My favorite part about this product is that it's organic. A great taste that your baby will love, and organic and safe, which parents will love. It's also an easy on the go food for your baby if you have multiple places to go. I had no problem rating this product 5 stars."
positive,18/5/18,"Although this is not marketed as a ""diet"" product, the fact that it is portion controlled makes it an excellent snack for anyone watching their weight.  Each bag is less than 100 calories and there is a lot of crunching satisfaction and great taste with this fruit."
positive,9/3/18,"This agave seriously has the best flavor, I have used several different brands of agave and they all have a weird aftertaste but not Xagave. It makes it so much easier to incorporate it into my recipes."
positive,27/2/18,"It's a  wonderful snack and an Immune System booster also.<br />I am so happy I found this and I recommended it to all my friends."
positive,20/2/18,"My vet recommended these for my half-Siamese, very particular, cat because she kept having tarter buildup (and, as a result, bad breath). I was skeptical because my cat is VERY picky about food. She LOVES them. It is her ""treat"" each day. Well, my vet stopped carrying them, so I came to Amazon and now I never have to worry about quick delivery, tarter buildup, bad breath or an unhappy kitty! Life is great with CET Enzematic cat chews!"
positive,22/3/18,"This wildrice mix tasted just a mite too hard after cooking but if you left it for very long it got mooshy...so the timing is critical, once the timing is down the rice comes out perfect [no more then 5 minutes]and has pure natural non-chemical taste.....very wholesome and the blend is a nice mix of flavor."
positive,12/3/18,"I've found this to be a good sweetener. I have to use more than they say (about 10 drops when I'm using lemon), but I use extra packet sweetener, too. Very happy. I'll just have to figure out how many ""servings"" I get from a bottle, but I'm guessing it's more economical than the stevia products I get at the grocery store."
negative,9/2/18,"It does sweeten,  but there is an aftertaste when used in coffee or tea that is made with a weak taste."
negative,7/12/17,I purchased two types of stevia to try to move from using artificial sweetener to stevia. I read recommendations for this product so I decided we would try it. This really has a strong aftertaste of alcohol and chemicals. (I was disappointed because we had two bottles of the stuff. My bad.) I threw it out because no one would eat the food that it touched.<br /><br />FYI - I prefer the Stevita Stevia Supreme because there is no aftertaste with it.  I wish it was in liquid form too because that would be helpful.
positive,24/5/19,I must say this product exceeded my expectation. I had the powder one before and it left a bitter after taste. I was very pleased with the liquid and have ordered on more in a different flavor.
positive,9/3/18,"Love the fact you can make as much or as little as you need.  You don't have to open the can and waste 1/2 the can.  They taste just a good as coming out of a can!"
positive,18/5/18,I never liked the taste of the refried beans in a can. I tried these and they were just as good as the kind you get in a mexican food restaurant. Melt some cheese on top.  I just ordered two of the cases of 8 each.
positive,23/3/18,"I originally bought these to help get my husband's cholesterol down.  This is another method to get in oatmeal without having to make a hot cereal.  I even pack them as a quick breakfast on the go.  The Chocolate Brownie and Cranberry are our favorite varieties."
positive,8/9/20,"I am really thrilled with this product.  I wanted to be able to make oatmeal in my slow cooker so that it was warm and ready in the morning with no hassles. I have done so in the past with old fashioned rolled oats and the outcome was always less than satisfactory no matter what adjustments I made to the water/oats ratio.  This attempt turned out perfectly the very first time, which most likely has to do with the 'cut' of the grain.  The ratio is 1 cup oats to 4 cups water on low for 8 hours (and 1 cup of dried fruit).  I added about 1/4 cup of quinoa and a total of 1 1/4 cups dried fruit (craisins, tart cherries, and goji berries) and 1 good sized diced Braeburn apple...no sugars.  I didn't use the spray 'Pam' product it tells you to put in the crock, but coated it with organic coconut oil which is solid at room temperature.  It was amazing...no sweetening needed to enhance the flavors.  My husband eats oatmeal every day and he really liked it too."
positive,23/2/18,"Had the pleasure of trying Outerbridge's Sherry Pepper Sauce in a fish chowder.  Delicious. Have since used it for stews and other soups, and as a marinade.  Adds just the right amount of kick, with loads of flavor.  Their steak sauce and soy sauce are also devine.<br />A little flavor of the island right here in my house."
positive,18/7/20,Perfect bachelor food - quick and easy.  Really tasty compared to top ramen noodles.  You can tell the seasoning is extremely sodium laden.
positive,14/6/18,We did the shopping season for Christmas. They indicated that the product would arrive by 18 January. To our surprise came before Christmas in excellent condition. Thoroughly recommended!
positive,2/11/18,"I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted these cookies. They are individually wrapped so they stay fresh. They are sweet enough but not over sweet. They aren't overpowering.  Everyone who has tried them agrees with this analysis. We had sweet amaretti cookies in Italy this summer and these can stand up to those. So Mangia!"
positive,14/10/18,"I bought this because of the pumpkin seeds and thought ""Oh, it's organic and 'hippy food', it's going to be awful"". However, it is amazing. Full of flavor and fruits and nuts, it is a hearty cereal that leaves you feeling good."
positive,6/4/20,"The soup really tastes great.  It is so convenient to throw one in your purse to take for lunch, etc and it was a great buy!!"
positive,9/3/18,"had never tasted these before buying them on amazon. did my research and amazon had the  best price. now that i have tasted it, i have to say it is delicious and made our bbq an even bigger hit! will continue to buy this brand!"
positive,18/5/18,"this mincemeat pie filling is Vegan and has great taste. Just put into prepared pie and bake, make a small 6"" pie, you need 2 jars for a large pie, Great fore the Holiday treats."
positive,7/3/18,I really thought EFS was an excelent product that gives me the extra push to make it through long rides.  Compared to Accelerade it is better however more expensive.  As an amature rider I am not sure that it is worth the extra cost.
positive,24/1/19,"It is what I wanted. Loaded with tender dried fruit and nuts. I'll order again."
positive,27/2/19,I really enjoy it. Is not my favorite Colombian coffee but is really closer to the No. 1.  Suddenly the price has been going up so much
negative,19/4/20,"I'm a chinese student. It smells like fruit, but it doesn't have ANY taste when you take a sip. Doesn't taste a little bit like TEA."
positive,17/4/20,"I give Foldgers a big yeah for this great tasting Columbian coffee. It's as good as dunking donuts and much better than Starbucks. It's just the right blend for breakfast. Love it Foldgers. I will continue to buy this coffee until I find something tastier."
positive,3/4/20,"This is a very tasty products, I love the crunch and the favor it gets four thumbs up from me"
positive,7/8/19,"I always taste the food I'm about to introduce to my kid - this one has a fresh berry taste, a bit too runny though, liquid smoothie. Baby loves it too, especially when it shoots up as a fountain when he squeezes it. :)<br />Problem is that its price increased drastically lately, i'm having a hard time justifying buying it instead of other, no less tasty products."
positive,9/3/18,"In the past, I just didn't use tomato paste very often. That's because most brands are just nasty. We'd always have a can of Hunt's or Contadina around, but I'd always be disappointed whenever I used them. It's really annoying to, say, make homemade enchilada sauce, have it taste mediocre, and then add insult to injury by having to throw away half a can of leftover tomato paste.<br /><br />Amore, by contrast, actually keeps the bright tomato flavor. Since it's in tubes, there's none of the ""tinny"" taste so common to canned foods. And it's so easy to squeeze out a small amount that I use it all the time. There are all sorts of soups and sauces that can benefit from a little tomato flavor, but which don't justify opening a whole can of paste. (Not to mention the fact that most canned pastes would make the food taste worse, not better.)<br /><br />There are only two mysteries about this product for me. First, a 1 1/2 tablespoon serving has 2 grams of fat. No other tomato pastes I looked at contain fat. Since the ingredients are only tomato paste and salt, I have to wonder where this fat comes from. The second mystery is that they label the box as ""double concentrated."" As far as I can tell, it's no more concentrated than any other tomato paste: I still have to use exactly the same amount in a recipe, it just tastes better than the other brands.<br /><br />But I'll forgive Amore the mysterious fat and exaggerated labeling. This has become a cooking essential in my kitchen."
positive,18/5/18,"I recently began using Wholesome Sweeteners products and could not be happier with the taste. I was so happy to discover this product and will continue using it, for sure!"
positive,27/1/19,"Tastes just like regular black tea only a little weaker. Don't get it if you expect it to actually taste like raspberries. I bought 6 boxes to use in the first half of my menstrual cycle for building a good uterine lining. It's organic, good tasting, and has health benefits without the caffeine. Can't go wrong!"
positive,10/11/19,"I bought this tea to help my pregnancy, i think it may be helping..im hoping. but it does taste very good i like it and would buy it again and recommend this product to friends."
positive,8/11/19,"I really like black tea and this is a great taste substitute while pregnant.  I had to brew it stronger than recommended but it's great."
positive,25/10/21,"Bought this food after reading others reviews for my schnauzer who suffers from pancreatitis -- it really did the trick for him, since being on this food he hasn't had one day of trouble.  A GREAT food."
positive,8/5/20,"I have been eating Medifast meals for a year.  Medifast changed the recipe to their pretzels and they were not as good. To my surprise the cinnamon pretzel that Kay's is a good if not better than Medifast and cost have the price.  The calories and protein were important factor and are pretty much the same based on ounces."
positive,28/9/18,"This is my husband's FAVORITE soda. Has a mild fruity flavor similar to Manzanita Sol, tastes like a little bit of heaven. I can't find any stores in my area that sell it but I have had good experiences buying it off Amazon. Just remember when you are buying to pay attention to the shipping weight as some of the distributors use a mass picture of a 12 pack but will actually be selling a 1.5 litre. Shipping weight for a 12 pack should be around 10lbs. Oh and Guarana comes in many flavors, but Guarana Antarctica is usually the most popular/favorite."
positive,29/7/19,I thought this a nice evenly tasting coffee with no bitterness or after taste. I enjoy it and will buy more in the future.
positive,9/3/18,This has perfect balance of sweetness & nutrients. Its a great breakfast item. I love it. I will but it again from amazon.com
positive,18/5/18,"This was handy when I couldn't get to a store and wanted some for the coming week...3rd day it was here, not bad price but looking for better price but this was good stuff. :)"
positive,17/5/20,"Most of the reviews are mostly negative, but if your brand new to this candy......its sooo delicious! If you like a chewy, hardness..feeling like your jaw is going to fall off. This is the stuff! I'm 16 and never heard of this candy before, but i tried it once at a world market and couldn't stop eating them, there so addicting! They have a great mouth watering taste to them. I would recommend this candy to new comers."
negative,26/3/20,"I usually drink the regular Caffe D""Vita but I am on a low carb diet with no sugar so I thought I would try the sugar free. I couldn't find it in the stores so I bought a six pack can through the internet. It has absolutly no taste. Now I am stuck with six cans of sugar free Caffe D"" Vita and don't know what to do with them. I would not buy this product again."
positive,24/2/20,"it's a tasty tea.  handy packets to keep at work.  Local store stopped carrying it, and the Amazon case is a decent price."
positive,3/5/19,"Quick shipping, well packed..I loved these! They were for a party & everyone enjoyed them. True melon flavor, not sticky & really good! Thank you!"
positive,27/3/20,"For some reason our local stores stopped stocking this product, my wife and I love the taste.  We used Amonzon.com to provide it.  Excellent TASTE!"
positive,31/12/20,"Previous reviews have been negative on the taste of this water, but to me, it has less taste than some common brands (Dasani, Aquafina) of water.  In that sense I like it more: I can't stand the slightly bitter/metallic taste of those waters.  This one ""tastes"" more like water.<br /><br />On the other hand, this is advertised for having the ""correct"" pH level, and as being electrolyte infused, but I have noticed nothing special about it in terms of how it impacts my workouts: it's wet, just like any other water.  So in this facet, I rate it as being less than advertised."
positive,13/1/20,"Has a smooth taste like it claims without any unpleasant metallic flavor. Hydrates well although I think it is rather expensive and I personally didn't notice it hydrating any better than Arrowhead water which is what I normally drink. If, however, you have already discovered that high ph water helps you more than other types this water tastes good and would be a good choice."
positive,21/9/20,A certainly refreshing bottle of water and a very large one at that. The taste is very pleasing without the plastic from the bottle taste to taint it. It seems a bit pricey though giving you extra benefits might just be worth the purchase.
positive,2/12/20,This water taste great. We love the bottle. Perfect water for everyone :) I love that it is 1.5 liters because I am trying to drink more water. You will love this water.
positive,20/11/19,"I am very picky about my water. I moved to Florida at the age of 15 and I quickly realized that I could not drink the tap water. I can actually taste the difference at restaurants when they serve tap water versus purified or bottled water. Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water is the best water I have ever tasted. It tastes completely clear and delicious.<br /><br />I only received a 1.5 liter bottle, so I did not notice any of the medical benefits of the 9.5pH water. I do have GERD, but didn't notice a difference with drinking the 1.5 liters of water over 2 days. The price is a little steep on this water, but I would consider buying more for the taste and to see if it really helps my GERD."
positive,2/12/20,"I admit I have a hard time identifying differences in most bottled water, unless they have some funky aftertaste. But this water is different. It tastes exceptionally clean and crisp. No chemical tastes, no salty taste, just very refreshing water. I like the large size of the bottles, as carrying one of these as I go out would guarantee I meet my water quota for the day. I poured some for my five year old granddaughter and she said, ""You have good water at your house, Granny."" so I guess there is a difference. When it's good, it's good!"
positive,11/12/19,"I'm not smart enough to know enough about bottled water. I'm in the camp who believes that naturally filtered well water is the best.  Most bottled water strips the natural minerals out.<br /><br />However, there is somethign to be said about water being too acidic.  A higher pH would be the opposite, so in that regard this should make this water much better.<br /><br />Honestly I cannot tell the difference.  But I can say ther was no odor.  There was no bad aftertaste. But I cannot say if this is worth the price."
positive,20/11/19,"This is one of the best tasting waters that I've tried. It is just purified water and not spring water but it has such a pure tasting taste to it. It is enhanced with minerals and honestly, I can taste the mineral taste which I like. Funny that a good tasting water is different from most drinks that we consume. Water is one that we want without any taste or flavor - just pure, fresh, wet and clean. Essentia is one without any noticeable flavors but the mineral taste.<br /><br />I really liked it and gave it to my family too. They were surprised with a yum which isn't really a reaction that I normally get from water.<br /><br />It has 9.5 pH factor and infused with electrolytes. Can't really tell those things from drinking it but good to know. Recommending completely on taste. It's excellent tasting water."
positive,28/6/20,"The first thing I look for in a water is the aftertaste.  Some of them have a metallic, nasty taste that I can not stand!  But this one is very refreshing.<br /><br />Cool, Clear and Fresh!<br /><br />Definately would buy again!"
positive,8/8/20,"I think the Essentia drinking water tastes very good.  There are a couple popular brands of bottled water that I think taste funny.  The Essentia is very good and ""crisp"".  I can't say much about the actual pH level, because I did not test it.  However, I didn't seem to have as many issues with my acid relux on the days when I drank the Essentia.  It's awkward carrying the 1.5 liter bottle around, but I did actually find it helpful.  I take it to work in the morning and make myself drink it until it's gone before I allow myself to have something ""good"" (meaning - bad for me).  Therefore, I do get a  much larger water intake during the day at the office than I normally would.  So, I love the taste and the size of the bottle, but it can get expensive.  I will probably keep some on hand, especially when my acid reflux is really acting up and the prilosec isn't helping, but I'm not sure if I could really afford to buy it to have every single day."
positive,14/7/21,"Tastes like good, odorless, fresh, clean water. I like the fact the water is electrolyte infused.  The bottle is a very generous size, but easy to grip and hold."
positive,2/12/20,"What else can I say, other than this drinking water tastes great.<br />The bottle is quite large, at 1.5 liter, it's almost the size of a 2 liter bottle of soda."
positive,20/11/19,"I'm on auto and I love my water.  Just wish it was a little bit cheaper, or IF they give discounts or free 6 pack with 4 orders, it would make thing a bit easier.  I will continue to get my Essentia as long as I am able to.  The water does have a lot of wonderful advantages.  I have fluid build up in my legs and sometimes my lungs because of my heart.  I had kidney failure, this water has helped me to be well hydrated and to keep my kidneys in working order.  The water goes directly where it is needed."
positive,1/3/21,"For me some bottle water is better than others. This bottled water was very good. It had a good, clean taste which is always important, especially for those who do not enjoy drinking water. The bottle was also thick enough to withstand being dropped but not so thick that you are really just paying for the bottle. Overall I would buy this bottled water again."
positive,5/5/21,"A LITTLE EXPENSIVE CONSIDERING ITS MAXWELL HOUSE.<br /><br />BUT ITS BETTER THAN STARBUCKS, FRESH AND I WILL BUY AGAIN. FOR 1 CUP/PERSON ITS IDEAL."
positive,2/12/20,"Our family LOVES these Cornuts! Delicious, fresh and crunchy.  We remember them from when we were kids and still can't get enough. We like all the flavors, but our favorite is still the original. After much research, this company offers the best price."
positive,20/11/19,"Ordered this because of some minor stomach issues. Certainly, hasn't hurt, but not sure it has all the healing powers others claim, but only time will tell. A few things...this honey tastes great, just about like regular honey. So don't be afraid to order it thinking you can't handle the taste. It has the consistency of a honey butter spread and is great right out of the jar, or on toast. Bottom line, probably more expensive than regular honey, but if you have some digestive issues, worth trying, as it is a good tasting product."
positive,9/10/21,"This is my first Manuka honey and I must say that it tastes very nice.<br /><br />Toast a slice of bread (e.g., Arnold's Ancient Grains)<br />Spread honey<br />Spread peanut butter<br /><br />Enjoy!"
negative,6/3/21,"I was really looking forward to trying this on some toast but the tast was so bitter that it was hard to enjoy.  I really gave it an honest try but yuck!  The price is fair and the consistancy was good.  Maybe it was just me,  I dont know."
positive,12/2/21,"This is definitely different than any other raw honey I've tried, and its fantastic, with three small kids i can't afford to be sick and a few spoonfuls of this stuff a day helps soothe a sore throat when I'm dealing with an innless or scratchy throat from allergies, and i could swear it also boosts my mood and energy. It also seems to help digestive problems, i started taking a tablespoon a day preventatively and was pleasantly surprised to be the only member of my family not laid low by a heinous stomach bug that swept through our home. I also love that this stuff doesn't have to be chiseled out of the jar like some raw honey. totally with the money, and this is the cheapest place to get it that i have found. My local whole foods charges almost double for the stuff!"
positive,2/12/20,"Just tried this for the first time yesterday. It could've fooled me that it wasn't coffee. I think it actually tastes better than coffee. The hazelnut flavor is great. Better for you and no caffiene reactions."
positive,20/11/19,"For a serving of full flavored and nutritious split pea soap that involves only boiling and pouring water.,,,nothing can beat<br />Dr. McDougall's Split Pea Soup with Barley. This is the best ""instant soup"" that is on the market."
positive,25/6/21,"I have tried pretty much all flavors, and it is great! I take it for lunch daily, it's quikly to preper, it is under 200 cal per meal, you save a lot of money and time do not leaving the office to a restaurant to eat, and is guilty free, bcuz is vegan! To me is a great solution for my lunch  time on weekdays, where I had daily look for a place to eat where I could get something vegetarian safe, under $10 and healthy. You will see how much money you save do NOT eating at a restaurant, bringing you own snaks and lunch from home."
positive,17/3/20,"Excellent price, considering what the local coffe shop charges for chai. This is the best chai tea mix I've ever tasted and the best value I've found."
negative,20/10/21,"Not worth buying, tastes like alcohol, no chocolate taste at all. Smells faintly of chocolate but not worth using. I wanted to increase the chocolate flavor of my protein shakes without adding carbs. This purchase was useless."
positive,21/7/20,"My geriatric Bouvier Des Flandres is 12 years old and becoming increasingly finicky with his eating.  This product not only is palatable but has encouraged him to eat, again.  It is also low in fat which is what he needs due to a history of pancreatitis."
positive,22/2/21,I use this syrup on pancakes and to make homemade granola. It is great tasting with lots of maple flavor. I love the spill resistant spout. Good value instead of going to the grocery store for pure maple syrup.
positive,8/6/21,This is a great product.  Great taste and texture.  I will definitely purchase more.
positive,2/12/20,"What can I say?  I just ordered another flavor from the same company.  Every one in my office comments on the rich smell and having a cup in the morning is something I look forward to.  If you like flavored coffee, you will like this one."
positive,20/11/19,For gluten free they are pretty good. They are a bit dry but that seems to be a problem with gluten free in general. I like the Simplebites line but I wish there were more varieties.
positive,25/1/21,"I wanted these for a crust for pumpkin cheesecake, but they didn't quite make it in time. No matter, we enjoyed them right out of the box. They are packed full of flavor. The big question, as with all GF baked goods, is texture. These cookies are excellent, very crunchy without being at all crumbly or sandy. If you've ever enjoyed Ppefferneuse, these will take you there. They are exactly like that, right down to the possibility of a cracked tooth. And that's not a negative, it's part of the charm. Really, they're good cookies, with outstanding ginger flavor. Mom says these are every bit as good as the Ppefferneuse she made for Christmas every year, and that's high praise."
positive,1/7/21,"I love Pamela's products, and Amazon is a great place to get a good prices!! I like these ginger snaps because they aren't too gingery, they're just right.... :)"
positive,30/9/20,This is the best pre-packaged Wasabi I have found. It has a great texture too. I only buy this now that a friend recommended it and I tried it.wa
positive,15/3/20,I bought a case of these noodles and was impressed with the quality. It is greenish in color and has a hint of spinach taste to it that I really liked. It is hearty and fills you up. In summary I really liked it and would buy it again.
positive,6/7/21,"Can you say sugar high? LOL That was the point in ordering a case. I sent it to my husband who's deployed overseas. He loves them!"
negative,29/6/21,"I love the regular version of this soup, and accidentally bought a case of the low-sodium version.  No amount of added salt improves the overwhelming blandness of this product."
positive,29/6/21,"This tea has a nice flavor, although it is hard to say if it is actually increasing my joint comfort.  The power of placebo can be just as powerful, if not more so, than any herb or medicine out there."
positive,26/7/21,"I love Horizon Organic products and accidentally stumbled across these in Starbucks.  I had a $5 gift card and instead of leaving a just little on it, I purchased a Horizon Organic Chocolate milk along with my coffee.  I thought ""I better go straight home so I can put this in the fridge for later""  WRONG!  I was so happy that they don't have to be refrigerated!  Then, I was even happier when I tasted it--- soooo good!  Now when I have a chocolate craving after dinner, I reach for one of these instead of a candy bar. Yes, they're still 180 calories, but I feel better about having one of these than candy, cookies, or ice cream.  They are a bit expensive, but with Amazon's current sale, and shopping around locally, I've found them for an ok price.  I also emailed Horizon Organic and they're sending me 3 coupons.  (I don't know for how much off)"
positive,21/10/21,"I like the taste of this chocolate milk.  It's not too sweet and the size is perfect to take to work and have it as my breakfast.<br /><br />--new<br />The design of this container is terrible for toddlers.  Opening from the top fits the straw perfectly but this is bad.  When my daughter drinks it she would try really hard to suck on the straw. When the air is gone and container is flat she would squeese it trying to get more milk."
positive,25/10/21,"I have purchased these in the past from other websites and love them.  I was excited to find such a deal on the price per bag by purchasing the case through amazon, although that is a lot of chips!  I ordered one plain and one spicy.  The plain were delicious and fresh.  The spicy were stale.  So now I have a case of stale chips and a case of fresh chips...thus the gamble with ordering in quantity I suppose.  The chips themselves are wonderful, nutty and a much healthier and lower carb/higher fiber alternative to tortilla chips.  I eat them plain, with salsa or make nachos with them.  We even crumble them over taco salad."
positive,29/6/21,"this is a nutritious and tasty way to add seasoning to grains, veggies, etc. that's NOT loaded with salt and other preservatives!"
positive,5/7/21,These have a great taste and are very crispy. Just cheese so they are good if you are trying to go low carb or are gluten free. The only problem I had was they are expensive.
positive,17/9/21,"Haven't gotten a box of yogi tea I didn't like and this one is no different. It's more of an herbal infusion with green tea, so it might not be as ""tea-y"" as one might expect. But if you're unsure if you want to commit to a whole case of the stuff, I'd buy a box at the store and test it out, because a case is a huge price savings in my CT area of about about $1.50 a box, but it's an expensive loss if it turns out you don't like it. Hopeful for good results! I'm getting married in four months and am using this as a part of a healthier skin routine."
positive,18/8/21,"I think these taste better than other non-gluten cakes.  perhaps it is the ingredients you need to add to the mix:  1/2 cup butter softened, 1 cup buttermilk, 2 large eggs, 1 t vanilla and 1/2 t almond extract.  You can make chocolate cake by adding 1/2c cocoa to dry cake mix and increasing the buttermilk to 1 1/2 cups.  One box makes two 8: cakes or 16 muffin cupcakes.  Mix is cheaper here than at Albertsons and Whole Foods.  Hodgson Mill batch tests using an ELISA Gluten Assay test.  all natural, gluten free ingredients that are both additive and preservative free."
positive,31/7/21,"If you like coffee with overtones of nuts, and are fond of pecans, you need to try this coffee. Mrs. Bryants Southern Pecan Organic coffee is a real treat with a genuine pecan flavoring. Try some with a slice of you favorite pecan pie!"
positive,18/10/21,"Lurpak is far better than any other butter out there.  Be glad you can buy it in the USA!  Creamy, tasty and just plain good."
positive,29/6/21,"These noodles are great I was stationed in Kuwait and had everyone eating them. I'm in dallas now, where can I find them?"
negative,16/9/21,"My mother in law received this tea in as a gift for Christmas and I had a cup and it was delicious.  It was in sealed packets.  This tea is in paper packets like Lipton tea and does not taste any thing like my mother in laws.  Don't be disappointed like I am and save your money and do not buy this product.  Unfortunately I had to open the package to see and taste this so I could not return it.  I would give it no stars but I had to give it one to post."
positive,24/8/21,"I bought this on a Fri. sale. At 50 cents a kcup it was a nice deal and it's definitely one of the better green mountain flavors."
positive,24/6/21,"Really quenches your thirst, but you need to like seltzer water; I do. Top of the line."
positive,27/9/21,"Not exactly perfect for extreme low-carb dieting, but still good enough compared to your average sugar-infused muffin mix. Flavor is pretty good, though the muffins are lacking something to round them off, but they are moist and have a good texture."
positive,29/6/21,"Immediately after placing my order I received an email from the seller with care instructions and specifics on the shipping of the bamboo. When it arrived (exactly when I was expecting it) it was in superb shape. I could tell not only by looking at it, but also by the smell! It was such a nice treat to open the package and be greeted with that fresh, sweet smell! Not only was the quality of the bamboo superb, but it was such a great price! I would absolutely recommend this seller and their products! :)"
negative,5/8/21,"My girlfriend and I are regular drinkers of flavor-pack enhanced water (read:  hate plain water).  I saw ads for this on TV and figured I'd give it a try.  I have to say we both hate the taste and it by far does not add nearly enough flavor to water no matter how much you put it.  I would not recommend[ this product at any price, go with the classic powder flavor packs;  [ASIN:B001EQ4HEE Crystal Light On The Go Fruit Punch Drink Mix, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)]]"
positive,29/6/21,"I have run into Nonni's at the homes of various friends and never thought to try and get some for myself.  They are the perfect complement to my morning cup of coffee and give me a little pick-me-up without loading me up first thing in the morning.  Delicious!  Buy some!"
negative,31/7/21,I do not think I am going to drink this anymore. Everytime I drink it I feel like I am on fear factor. With an after workout powder like this I do not look forward to drinking it after a workout
positive,11/9/21,"Have never been a big meat-eater, but cut back even more a few months ago.  I began supplementing my diet with more beans/legumes, but was not feeling nutritionally satisfied, and realized I was not getting enough protein.  Did a little research, and discovered that hemp was ideal for meeting protein requirements, and according several articles I read, it has many other nutritional and health benefits as well.  I purchased the Nutiva hemp protein powder in conjunction with the Better Than Milk ""Rice"" (to avoid over use of soy).  According to directions for both products, I mix 4 tablespoons hemp protein and 2 tablespoons of  BTM, in water.  It mixes easily in a regular plastic shaker, and I don't even have to use the ""de-clumping"" attachment that fits inside the shaker. It's just Shake-N-Go! This combination has been the perfect way to start my day.  I was concerned about the taste, as some reviews I have read rated the taste of hemp very low. I can't speak for other brands, but the finely ground Nutiva hemp powder has a mild nutty flavor, and I LOVE IT. From what I've read, hemp does not contain oligosaccharides (which commonly causes ""gastric distress"" with soy proteins), and I have not experienced any bloating with the hemp and rice milk combo. I am happy to start my day with something both nutritious and delicious, and thank goodness I don't have to use the electric blender (one less thing to wash).  Also, the Amazon price on the Nutiva Hemp Protein and the Better Than Milk Rice can't be beat, and both qualify for free shipping.  FANTASTIC!!!"
positive,12/8/21,I did not expect this to taste very good.  I was surprised that it was great.  I will be ordering this item in the future. It also arrived very quickly.
positive,31/7/20,"A fantastic buy! Totally worth it.<br /><br />I am done itch buying tose little packages - you're just paying of packaging there. This yeast is fantastic. I e put it in a plastic container after I opened it and leave it the refrigerator. Also, whenever a recipe calls for instant yeast, I just add 25% more yeast to the recipe and it turns out perfect!"
positive,13/6/20,"This tea tastes wonderful by itself with a little honey or stevia, if you are counting calories or carbs.  For a real treat, mix it with a little peppermint tea.  Bigelow makes a Morroccan Mint that is really great for this particular mix, but it is not available on Amazon (yet)."
positive,31/7/20,"Bigelows only red tea (so far) is pear. The flavor is excellent, no caffeine, and its organic. The pear flavor is light and doesnt taste artificial (because its not). I have about 20 red teas that I drink regularly because it so low in tannins and doesnt aggravate my illness. Bigelows Asian Pear is one of my favorites."
positive,13/6/20,"The taste reminds me of maple syrup.  It's very tasty when used in cereal or on pancakes, but it's also a perfect sweetener for my tea, and it doesn't change the flavor of my tea when I use it.  I don't use honey, nor do I like the taste, and this does not taste anything like honey to me."
positive,26/9/20,"I don't eat stuff like this very often, but when I'm in the mood it's nice to know I have an alternative that isn't quite as bad as the original.  It's handy enough to throw in my purse and take to the movie theater - and a much better option than the popcorn there.  I wouldn't recommend making a steady diet of the stuff - after all, it is essentially all refined carbs, but for that occasional treat, this would certainly be a better choice than other alternatives - and the taste is fantastic."
positive,17/10/20,"These are some awfully tasty donuts.  They consist of a fairly dense golden cake coated in chocolate.  They're small, but rather dense and rich.  They're always moist- probably because of some additive, but it's the additives that make them tasty.  This is something I can only stand to eat every so often, but on occasion, they are really delicious."
positive,14/12/20,"I like this hot cocoa mix a lot.  The taste is better than what you usually get at the office or grocery store, which shouldn't come as a surprise for a Ghirardelli product.  It's a bit expensive, but it's worth it in my view."
positive,29/5/20,Found this to be an excellent product for making cherry limeades to flavoring yogurt!  Have made this one of my pantry staples!
positive,9/12/20,As i have stated before i love cheery flavor so this was awesome and my sweetheart liked it too.<br />You can add as much water to it to suit your own taste.
positive,4/8/20,"This is very good. I am taking it because I have some gout at the tips of my toes. And I exercise intensely every day. So I want to protect my joints. It's part of my daily health regiment. It's got a good taste but the directions say take two tablespoons for a 6-8 oz glass. Seems too diluted for me so I put 3 tablespoons to a 8oz glass seems to taste better. I haven't tried taking just a tablespoon straight yet."
positive,31/7/20,"These bars kick fruit butt!  They really are one of the best ""breakfast"" bars that I have ever tasted, plus they appear to be somewhat healthy which is always good.  I can eat one of these for breakfast and be satisfied."
positive,13/6/20,"Get the variety pack first and try each one. I like all three, but the peppermint chocolate and dark chocolate I like the best."
positive,21/11/20,My 11 year old loves this product.  It is a nice little variety pack.  I am going to subscribe for 1 every 3 months.  Best hot chocolate k-cups made!
positive,25/5/21,"i was honestly a little afraid to try this tea because it gets so many mixed reviews in general and especially after reading about pu-erh's fermentation process.  But I am so glad that i didn't let all of that discourage me.  This is a very smooth, rich, full-bodied tea that satisfies someone like me who drinks lots of bold dark coffee.  It definitely has a very earthy taste that is very invigorating any time of the day.  I used to think that black tea was my favorite but that has definitely changed!!  What makes this specific brand better as well is the fact that the seller is extremely fast at shipping the item!!"
positive,25/5/21,"Read some reviews that said this tea could taste strong and earthy, but Generation Pu-erh tea was surprisingly nice, much nicer than green tea. I'm very happy with this product.<br /><br />And the service was exceptional, shipping incredibly FAST! Thanks!"
positive,20/1/21,"You can't find a better tasting mustard, Not only is great with Nathan's Hot Dogs but taste great with anything that you want to put mustard on."
positive,15/1/21,"I will definitely be keeping this in my collection, great salt and great vendor.  This shipped the morning after I ordered it and received it two days after that.  Had a free sample and a bamboo salt spoon in it too."
positive,8/2/21,"I drink a LOT of tea. I probably drink around 14 cups a day, and I drink the good stuff. All whole leaf, quality, loose-tea. So I know a good cup of tea when I see one.<br /><br />These are the ONLY bottles of tea that are of FANTASTIC quality.<br /><br />Ito-En makes amazing stuff, and this is my absolute favorite tea from them. The price is excellent and the drink is SO healthy; I have it delivered once a month, every month.<br /><br />HIGHLY recommended. :)"
positive,10/2/21,These are a great alternative to high calorie snacks - great with salsa or any type of dip.  Also great as a side with soup.
positive,9/10/20,Product came quickly and in great condition. They taste great.  The bags are larger than the little snack bags of chips I usually get. I am very pleased.
positive,31/7/20,"When ever possible I try to buy the Duncan Hines angel food cake mix as it's the best tasting box cake mix on the grocery shelf. Some of the other angel food cake mixes may have a slightly funky after taste. The Duncan Hines brand does not.<br /><br />The cake mix is easy to prepare and bakes up tall and light.<br /><br />Highly recommend.<br /><br />Note:  I like the two-step version of this cake mix but it's no longer made. :-("
positive,13/6/20,"I had been buying the store brand for years but Skippy reminded me why it's okay to spend the extra few cents to have better taste."
positive,5/12/20,This is really nice to have when you just want something a little different.  It makes drinking a cup of coffee step out of the ordinary.
positive,1/11/20,"This is very tasty jerky but I'm laughin' at the ""spicy"" part!  I had no idea it was supposed to have some heat to it until I read the package a little more carefully.  Really, it is not ""hot"" spicy at all to me but does taste good.  The pack I ate was filled with lots of smaller pieces and only a few slices.  I didn't find it overly dry, just kind of moist and chewy.  Great high protein snack for low carbers and anyone else.  Less than 1 gram of carb per serving, 60 calories per serving and 2 servings per bag.  But you'll probably eat the whole bag because it's not that much!  Enjoy!"
positive,14/1/21,"These seeds taste very good.  They arrived much quicker than I had anticipated.  I especially enjoy these seeds sprinkled on top of soup instead of crackers.  I am trying to cut back on the amount of grains I consume,"
positive,6/6/21,"I don't generally care too much for the healthy alternatives, especially when it comes to coffee. However, after trying Truvia at a hotel, I am now hooked. I usually get it at the grocery store, but it is good to see that it is available on Amazon, and now that I have Prime, I might just be getting it online instead.<br /><br />This sweetener tastes really good, and in addition to coffee, I have had it with desserts and it tastes great. I think it even tastes better than sugar, and definitely tastes better than splenda.<br /><br />I cannot comment as to the health aspects related to artificial sweeteners, but I'm sure that there is plenty of information available on the Internet related to that.<br /><br />As a casual coffee drinker, I highly recommend Truvia! However, you may be better off purchasing a larger box (300 or 400 count) instead of this pack of six ... Unless you just really like the size of the 40-count boxes. But if you have never tried it, definitely purchase a smaller box to try it out first!"
positive,21/7/20,I ordered this as I had been missing ramen noodles since I became vegetarian.  I wanted something that was tasty and yet healthy.  These noodles are so much better than I had expected.  I would highly recommend!
positive,5/1/21,"My daughter loves these.  In fact, she loves any type of Annie's bunny crackers.  They are definitely a healthier option for snack crackers."
positive,23/1/21,"Got some of this on sale at the local grocery store today..was impressed with the taste. The energy boost isn't much different from other products to me. However, the taste is something I'd actually drink as a regular drink! Impressive since many energy drinks are foul tasting.."
positive,31/7/20,"My wife drinks about 3-4 cups of these a day, and loves them. We always have enough on the shelf, and they don't go bad. No caffeine, so she sleeps like a baby."
positive,13/6/20,"Whenever people eat roasted veggies at my house, they ask what I use to season vegetables.  Olde Thompson Callifornia Garlic Sea Salt is a favorite.  The grinder is excellent. It gives any dish that extra zing.  Never tastes salty, just better.  Try it.  You'll love it!!"
positive,1/12/20,"Good Earth is a great tasting decaf white tea, which is more healthy even than green tea.  It is very hard to find in health food or regular food stores, so glad to know it is available<br />through Amazon."
positive,30/1/21,Makes a lovely gift!  The flavor is is intoxicating and can be used for spicing up any kind of dish.
positive,1/1/21,"These Takis have a great taste to them! Tried them about 3 weeks ago, and now I love them. The taste is great, they are very spicy and hot, but they are also very good. The crunchy, lime, hot taste they have is just one of the best."
positive,11/1/21,"Full of pulp, which my daughter loves!! I only wish they came in glass and not a can..."
positive,31/7/20,"They crumble easily and I can use water from my coffee pot (minus the coffee of course) and the variety of flavors it a win!  Sure the calories are a bit high, but you can work that off in no time.<br /><br />The Good:  Quick, easy and flavorful<br /><br />The Bad:  The calories<br /><br />Overall:  I will keep buying them while deployed"
negative,13/6/20,"I received this produce pretty fast, the packaging is really cute but the tea is tasteless. It is a mint tea but I cannot taste the mint at all. Disappointed, will not order again."
positive,14/1/21,"Great taste and convenience for quick addition of onions to recipes that include a lot of liquid at the beginning of the cooking cycle - soups, rice, etc."
positive,7/12/20,"I was tentative ordering 44 kcups of this flavor but figured for $14.99 it was worth a try. I like these. For my taste they are not too sweet and I definitely am glad I got them. Not too watery even at the 8 oz setting. All in all, I like the flavor and am waiting for another deal. A little kalua is not bad at night either ;)"
positive,5/5/21,"I really enjoyed this. I bought it when it was on sale for $14 for two boxes!!! I don't drink, but I think this would make an excellent cocktail with rum, vodka or whiskey. I will say, though, it's very rich, I usually only drink a couple gulps. I'd like to try it with different syrups, like maybe raspberry syrup or put ice cream in it."
positive,23/11/20,"Great product, but boy did I waste money buying this from Amazon. It only cost $1.59 in the local asian supermarket."
positive,29/8/20,My kids loved this tasty treat. The apple pieces were a nice size and tasted like a fresh apple. Will be buying more of these in the future!
positive,18/1/21,"This is a much better tasting instant tea than anything else Lipton currently makes.  It is not as convenient coming in the big jar vs. the individual packets but the taste is well worth it.  Lightly sweet, with just a hint of tea.  Highly recommend!!"
positive,18/6/21,Lipton Raspberry Instant Mix is so easy to make just put a few spoons of the product in a glass of water and add ice---it has such a light fruity taste that you feel good every time you take a drink--try it when you come in the house after a hot time in the garden---sooo good
positive,18/6/21,"Great taste! For years I bought another lemon product (can't remember the name!) that I was very happy with then happened to come across this product and wow! it was even better so buying it regularly for last couple of years. Use mostly in iced tea."
positive,7/7/21,This candy jar is great! My daughter loves Hello Kitty and she was so excited to see this candy jar.  Very durable and easy to fill.
positive,18/6/21,"Really yummy!  I ate them all within 2 days!  =/  They taste better than fruit by the foot, which I also like.  I'd definitely like to buy some more in the future."
negative,7/7/21,"I've been a customer of Right Foods for almost 8 years, but the Asian Entrees don't do it for me.  They taste bitter, and the seasoning is inconsistent."
positive,1/7/21,"Wow, how do they pack all that sweetness and flavor into just a few drops?<br />I just tried it in my coffee and I was very surprised. This is great stuff and such a blessing for the diabetics out there like myself."
negative,7/7/21,"I love my hot chocolate, But this one is very weak, I have to add a little syrup to give it a more chocolate taste."
positive,23/7/21,"I bought this with my hestitation<br />however, it tastes good. it has a very butterly taste and sweet as well<br />only 8 pieces not so many:("
positive,20/7/21,"Closest ""red"" Mexican rice since a dinner in Mexico.  I add two heaping tbsps. of crumbled bacon and a can of RO-TEL Original diced tomatoes and green chilies.  Everyone from college students to a 90 year old love it."
negative,19/7/21,"These cookies are not sweet at all, which is ok, but they also have NO flavor at all. They name is vanilla creme cookies- where is vanilla?? The texture is kind of strange too-cookie is crumbly, but around the creme it is crunchy. overall - will not be buying this product ever again."
positive,18/6/21,"very cherry tasting- reminds me of cherry popsicles. with the addition of vitamins it's a great alternative to juices and sodas. it's very dark red so be careful of stains"
positive,7/7/21,"These gummi vitamins taste great - -sweet and sour. Made with arctic cloudberries, which are like yellow raspberries but not as sweet. Suitable for adults as well as kids."
positive,27/6/21,"we bought these to make out xmas eve stuffed vinegar peppers.  everyone prefers red peppers, but the usual jarred vinegar cherry tomatoes are mostly green.  I saw these, and though expensive, decided to buy them just for the holiday.  they are very tender and tasty.  our only complaints are that they are much smaller, therefore a little difficult to stuff, and pricey. For taste, I'd give them 5 stars!"
positive,21/7/21,"THESE LOLLIPOPS HAVE THE BEST FLAVOR EVER. I'VE TRIED MANY BUT<br />THESE ARE DEFINITELY THE VERY BEST. THEY COME IN MANY FLAVORS.<br />SOMETHING FOR EVERONE."
positive,18/6/21,Easy mix.  Great taste.  Works well with my bread machine and makes large loaves.
positive,7/7/21,"Tasted this at a tea, came home and ordered the loose and the sachets.  I've shared some with a friend.  Harney makes wonderful tea."
positive,30/6/21,I have been trying to find a gluten free product that tastes good.  This taste so good that my family did not guess that it was gluten free.  Unbelievable !! but true.
positive,1/7/21,"Taste great. I use this to make vanilla latte and vanilla coke. YUM!!! and it doens't contain any corn syrup!!!"
positive,24/8/21,"I have ordered these types of chocolates before(Weinbrand Bohnen Brandy Chocolates) and these were fantastic, they had great flavor,were very fresh(sometimes they dry up if they are older),and were the perfect size(some larger ones are too big and the liquid can run if not all in your mouth),the chocolate as well as the brandy were of high quality and very tasty... Also the price was great for as many that were in the package... I ordered these very close to the holiday and they arrived earlier than expected!"
positive,21/7/21,I love my Tassimo Coffee machine and I love the Gevalia Signature Blend Coffee.  It is great any time of day.  Never bitter or over bearing.. always smooth and mild.  I have been using it for over 2 years now and the coffee is brewed the same for every cup.  I highly recommend Tassimo machine and Gevalia Signature blend coffee.
positive,25/6/21,"This coffee has a rich flavor without any bitterness.  I usually do not like coffee made with dark beans because they are too strong for my taste but this coffee is great tasting.  I signed up for Amazon's subscribe and save service and ordered just one 32 oz bag to try it.  The 15% discount and free shipping with the subscribe service makes it a great bargain too!"
positive,13/9/21,"Bold and tangy, the Taco Bell Spicy Ranchero Sauce is excellent.  We've used it with tacos and with flautas, and now there is none left in our sample bottle!  Everyone liked it, even those who normally don't care for spicy foods.  Off to the grocery for more!"
positive,18/6/21,"This sauce is pretty good. It's 55 calories per tablespoon. I tried this sauce with chicken and really liked it. It's not too spicy at all. I don't usually eat spicy food and am very sensitive to even small amounts of heat in my food. This sauce hardly had any heat at all."
positive,7/7/21,"the taste of this sauce isn't anything earth-shattering, but it's good.had it on my lunch turkey wraps for a few weeks and four dabs went a long way for flavor.not spicy at all,creamy,and just the right zip to spice up something a tad without the hotness or watery consistency of salsa."
positive,15/7/21,"This sauce has a unique and interesting flavor. It makes a great salad dressing as well. Overall, I recommend and like the fact there are are few ingredients. Enjoy."
positive,11/7/21,"Even though sugar free, these candies taste as good as the sugared variety. Good mix of flavors in small packages."
positive,7/10/21,"i bought sumac to make the fattouch salad I was making for authentic,wouldnt have been the same without it,gives it a nice sweet flavor,especially the dressing,now Im looking for other ways to use it"
positive,6/7/21,"Mycodex Plus Environmental Control Aerosol Household Spray is amazing.<br />The basement was full of fleas this year. One can sprayed onto the basement floor took care of the problem. Other products have been tried, as well as flea bombs having been set off. Nothing else seemed to work. This stuff is A Plus. Would definitely use again if ever there was a need."
positive,18/6/21,"There is a LOT of popcorn in this bag.  We've had this without butter and it tastes great!  I've never had popcorn that tastes this good.  Great product!"
positive,7/7/21,"This popcorn has pretty fair flavor plain. I always add buttery oil and salt to it because I'm a fat-fat. I purchased this bag of popcorn 25 months ago and I still have about 4-5 pounds left. Next time I think I will get the 50 pound bag and I won't have to worry about buying popcorn for the rest of my life. You will save a ton of money by purchasing bulk bags of seeds and a popcorn popper. I highly recommend this product, along with the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006IUWA"">Presto 04820 PopLite Hot Air Popper, White</a>, for all popcorn lovers."
positive,27/7/21,"this popcorn is very good. its cheap, but it doesn't taste like it. very fluffy. this is the perfect popcorn for people who don't want to spend 6 bucks on 3 bags of popcorn."
positive,13/7/21,"Some of my friends who I have offered these to say they taste like SOAP.<br /><br />And even I have to admit they have a very unusual taste, but that is what I love about them!<br /><br />AND they leave your breath smelling wonderful for a really long time afterwards.<br /><br />I first purchased these at World Market, but here I got them at less than half of what they sell them for each there.<br /><br />Live on the edge, try Violet candy today!<br /><br />I wish they also made them in Lavendar flavor too."
positive,13/9/21,This is another in a series of good Kashi cereals.  I have yet to have a bad one.
positive,7/9/21,"We made this and it was light, easy to make and great with chips and vegetables.  I purchased 20 for neighbors and friends for the hollidays"
positive,17/4/21,Item was perfect.  They have a very good sweet cinnamon taste and they were not too hot (I do not like spicy food) for me.  I received them quickly and would re-order again.  These are my favorite candies and it is very hard to locate in stores now.
positive,10/3/21,"I purchased this on a whim after eating a butternut squash pasta dish at a very nice restaurant. I am  VERY leery of canned/jarred pasta sauce and almost always prefer to just make my own from scratch. However, this sauce is just divine! It has a very robust taste and is pleasantly sweet. I paired it with cheese ravioli and it was just perfect. I think that it would be great with just about any pasta. It is a pleasant change from a tomato based sauce and is very satisfying. I highly recommend!"
positive,17/4/21,"I've tried many types of chocolate drinks since I don't drink milk. This one along with Trader Joe's chocolate soymilk are my favorites. Would give 5 stars except that it's pretty expensive."
positive,21/1/21,"A friend of mine has suggested ""Leilalove French Macaron"" to me. It is realllllly awesome. If you are a ""Cookie Lover"" it worth testing. Plus, beautiful package and on time delivery."
positive,30/1/21,"I first purchased this product at BJ's wholesale club. This is the best flavored carbonated water I've ever had. Like other reviewers, BJ's discontinued in favor of another product, what a mistake! I wrote to Talking Rain and their new president requesting this product have an online outlet...and it seems they delivered. Yes, it is more expensive, but with super saver shipping and subscription service (15%) savings, I'm in for a few cases each month. Try it, you will love it."
positive,13/2/21,"I purchased this on a whim based on a co-worker's comment about how much they like this brand.  It's not the best value at $1.25 each on subscribe & save but I was interested enough to give it a shot.  I'm glad I did!  All three flavors were great and each time I picked one up I was saying, ""This is definitely my favorite flavor"" but then I'd say the same on the next one and let's just call it a vicious circle!<br /><br />I did want to point out, and why I deducted 1 star, the picture of the product listed shows ""Pomegranate Berry, Orange Mango and Black Raspberry"".  However, the package that was received had Lemon Lime in place of Pomegranate Berry.  While it was a great flavor, I was looking forward to trying the Pomegranate Berry.  I'm hoping maybe my next shipment is what is shown on the picture."
positive,15/1/21,"I liked the taste of these cookies and they reminded me of my childhood.<br /><br />However, these are packaged different.  They are sealed in a plastic wrapper, not the wax type paper from a long time ago.  I am guessing that this keeps the graham crackers fresh tasting for a long time.<br /><br />They were crispy and had a decent taste.  My only complaint was that several of the packages were damaged and the crackers were crumbs."
positive,6/3/21,"These graham crackers are a lot better tasting than the organic graham crackers that I have tried. And compared to other brands (generic) I much prefer the crunchy sweetness of Honey Maid. The graham crackers taste so fresh and are the best for dunking in milk or tea. I love these as an alternative to cookies. Fortunately, the packaging ensures that the last graham cracker is as good and crispy as the first one. The portable and palatable treats are great for kids or anyone on the go (and for making perfectly shaped s'mores)."
positive,8/6/21,"As far as cookies go, this isn't going to ruin your diet (much) and it's pretty tasty too!  Three cookies, and they aren't tiny cookies either, are 140 calories.  There are 2g of both fiber & protein.  They aren't too sweet, which is great for me.  These are called ""cookies"" but they seem more like crackers.  They are kind of dry, which I don't mind, but the blueberries make them a little chewy.  The ingredients DO NOT list sulfur dioxide (a color preservative for many dried fruits).  Yay!  Sulfur gives me hives anyway.<br /><br />As of right now, these are $18.22 per package for 4 packages of 10 servings each.  I'm hoping these become subscribe & save items.  These are good & I will probably get them again."
positive,7/1/21,"Newtons Fruit Thins are quite delicious.  As soon as you bite into one of these crispy cookies, you can taste the real blueberries, right down to a few seeds, but I did not specifically notice the brown sugar flavor. They are just the right thickness to be crispy, not hard.  The package contains a plastic tray with 2 rows of cookies, 15 cookies in each row. Very enjoyable!"
positive,17/4/21,"These cookies were unexpectedly tasty and crispy given the fact that there was no hydrogenated fat in them. I always look at the list of ingredients for the word, ""hydrogenated"" even when the label says ""no trans fat.""<br /><br />They're not too sweet, with a slight taste of blueberry and brown sugar. I agree with other reviewers that they have an addictive quality to them, and with only 140 calories for three cookies (about 47 calories per cookie), one could get into trouble by overindulging. My husband and I really liked these, however.<br /><br />These would be perfect for dunking in milk or crumbling over ice cream. Enjoy!"
positive,10/3/21,"These cookies aren't like the traditional Fig Newtons/Fruit Newtonss I have bought in the past.  They look more like a thin cracker.  The cookies are also crunchy like a cracker, but definitely not as dry.  They are sweet but not too sweet, and very blueberry.  They remind me of the very top of a blueberry muffin, which is a good thing!  I'll definitely buy more of these for my family."
positive,14/1/21,"It's incredibly tasty.  I'd recommend that any hot/spice lover give it a try.  I'll attempt to give an objective description, but well, it's a spice.  You'll really have to taste it yourself.<br /><br />Hotness: mild or roughly like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004LZSYS"">TABASCO brand Pepper Sauce - Original Red 12 oz.</a><br /><br />Saltyness: none!  It's just pepper.<br /><br />Absorption: v.high, v.finely ground; unable to observe any small flecks after cooking into my standard spice test: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SIZK5K"">Top Ramen Variety Pack 48ct (24-3oz Beef-24-3oz Chicken)</a><br /><br />It has a very clean smooth taste, almost like adding pure ""hotness"" to food without the smoky overtone of Tobasco, the roughness of black pepper, or the cumin of chili sauces.  It has a very slight ""cling"" or ""linger""; ie. as with habanero peppers, where the more you eat, the hotter it gets.<br /><br />One or two sips of water will wash it clean.  I haven't tried it with mixed spiced and milder dishes, but due to how easy it is to sip the hotness away, it should work very well there."
positive,24/5/21,"I like this flavor, but it kind of reminds me a Jello Pudding Bites and those things are just nasty. I mostly use this one for 'recipes' to create new flavors."
positive,14/10/21,"I encountered this snack in a vending machine, liked it, and bought a case for travel.  I think it is very tasty stuff, and reasonably healthy, especially compared with other packaged snacks."
negative,7/2/21,"The flavor of the two does not taste lie strawberries and vanilla in my opinion. For being naturally flavored they do have a ""manufactured"" taste. I tried one of each before giving the rest away......"
positive,29/3/21,"I have loved ultra thin pretzel sticks since Mr. Salty used to sell them.  Then for decades I never saw an other ultra thin pretzel sticks and didn't even know if any were available anywhere.  Then I saw them at a local department store and was ecstatic.  But then, after going twice, they discontinued them - these are the ones that were at the department store.  I was disappointed but decided to give Amazon.com a shot and see if I could find them here.  And I did!  They even have a subscription plan where you can get a case every month, 3 months, or 6 months and the price for a case is reasonable (especially if you go with the subscription at which time your shipping is always free - just buying a case costs WAY too much with shipping).  I wasn't too thrilled with the idea of having to have a subscription just for free shipping but you can cancel at any time.  And I found that having a case on hand is nice and so we're getting them every 6 months - that gives us time to eat what we want, share with our grown kids and grandkids and still give us time in between orders to not get sick of them.  It's great - I highly recommend these - especially if you love ultra-thin pretzel sticks like I do."
negative,17/4/21,"I was very disappointed.  I love good cider, having grown up and gone to the mill each year.  I like most grocery store cider as well.  This stuff was really bad, tasted to me like raw chemicals.  Went through 4 or 5 people who spit it out directly.  Not my machine, they liked the tea and coffee and even ran hot water between to see if that was it."
negative,10/3/21,"Not nearly as good tasting as the other kcup ciders I've had. My girlfriend hated it too. They are going to find the garbage can."
positive,10/7/21,"These k-cups are a quick and tasty way to make a hot cup of cider. I have tried several brands of k-cup cider and this is by far the best, the caramel flavor is also very good."
positive,27/1/21,Taste much better than the regular Apple Cider.  I look forward to drinking a cup at night after work.  Smells great too!
negative,1/6/21,"I usually purchase the Green Mountain Naturals Apple Cider.  I found this product was much cheaper and I would try it.  From now on, I will spend the extra for a taste I enjoy.  This went down the sink!"
positive,20/8/21,"I had this tea first a few years ago on vacation. I had it again on my vacation last week and fell in love with it again. As soon as I got back home, I ordered a box and love it. This tea is sweet and delicious. A definite buy for parents and even their kids."
positive,14/8/21,"My family loves Ginger Chews. Great for motion sickness, generalized upset stomachs and to just freshen up ones breath. We have been buying ginger chews for over 6 years now! Absolutely a great multi-purpose product with a bonus: tastes great!"
positive,21/4/21,"I haven't tried other crystallized ginger to compare but I have a hard time not sneaking a piece here & there til the can is mostly empty.  I expected more of a dried product but this is delightful."
positive,1/4/21,"We take in enough pollutants in food and drink, even bottled water, to take at least one step in the right direction, and that's drinking the purest water on earth - Hawaii Water. Not only is this purest water a terrific internal cleanser, it tastes wonderful. Everyone I know who has tried it loves it. I didn't drink much water before my son turned me on to this; now it replaces juices, sodas, and other bottled waters."
positive,17/4/21,Excellent service - 1 week before Christmas and ON TIME! Best mixed nuts - bar NONE.
positive,10/3/21,Excellent breakfast alternative and meets low sugar expectation.  Not sure why this product is not widely available in stores.
positive,22/4/21,I love these chips.  I no longer crave regular potato chips!!  They are so tasty and crunchy!! Alot of salt tho!!
positive,25/4/21,My son likes this pretty well and I like that it introduces some flavors not found in typical baby foods. High quality.
positive,1/4/21,"I liked this bar.  It had a good balance of flavor and wasn't overly sweet.  I would have preferred that there was a bit more protein in it, but it works as a ""snack"" bar."
negative,30/6/21,"I love chai and the price was right so I bought this thinking, ""how different could it be from the Celestial Seasonings spiced chai I bought recently?""  Big difference, this tea has no flavor."
positive,1/3/21,"This stuff is so good I can't understand why our stores in the Wash metro area stopped carrying it.  I use it for marinade for fish and chicken.  The finished product tastes like a professional chef cooked the food.  I will always have at least 2 bottles in the house."
positive,29/1/21,"I bought this product due to my obsession with Malai Kofta, and also the high reviews.  I was not disappointed.  There is great flavor in the product and it filled me up for dinner.  The potato dumpling/balls were a little hard but I had boiled the pouch, so maybe next time I will pour the whole packet out and heat it up that way.  Highly recommended, it is the next best thing when you are too lazy to head to the Indian restaurant 20 miles away!"
positive,17/4/21,"This assisted ""home made"" sauce is much fresher and more tasty than premade sauces.  It has some ""Zip"" to it!"
positive,10/3/21,"Most stores don't carry product but is the best and easy to fix spaghetti on the planet you can buy."
positive,30/5/21,"I first bought this in Mallorca and brought it back to the states.<br />Fantastic salt on fresh tomatoes from the garden couples with balsamic and great spanich olive oil...can't miss"
positive,28/9/21,"We thoroughly enjoyed the taste of this rice. The grains were long and smelt excellent. On top, this is organically grown rice so free from chemicals and pesticides. Will buy this rice again :)"
positive,6/5/21,"These instant potato flakes taste great and do not contain sulfites like many commercial brands.  I do wish they included some simple instructions on the bag.  We used the instructions from Bob's Red Mill potato flakes (now discontinued).  For 2 servings:  heat 3/4C of water to boiling, add 1T butter or margarine and 1/4tsp of salt.  Remove from heat and add 1/4C cold milk or soymilk.  Add approximately 2/3C of potato flakes (more or less depending on how stiff you like them).  Stir gently and fluff with a fork.  Do not whip."
positive,20/4/21,"The product arrived just as advertised, two 24 ounce containers of McCormick taco seasoning. It was well-packaged and sealed upon arrival. It was spicier than I thought it would be, but still exactly what I wanted. I eat eggs every morning for breakfast and top it with this seasoning. Talk about a wake up!"
positive,20/4/21,We like our coffee fresh and strong and this product fills the bill. Delivered fresh and full flavored.
negative,21/4/21,"We didn't like the taste of this sort.<br />We are from Europe, American style coffee isn't what we like.<br /><br />After this we tried ""Coffee Bean Direct Brazilian Santos, Whole Bean Coffee, 5-Pound Bag"", this was much better."
negative,2/5/21,"I'm utterly baffled by the positive reviews for this product.<br /><br />Now I've been using Stevia for the past year to sweeten my coffee. I have no issue with the Stevia.<br /><br />I used to drink a lot of soda, and then a few years back, a lot of diet soda. Since then, I've been able to give up soda altogether. But my Dad who is diabetic, is absolutely obsessed with diet coke. I've been trying to get him to lessen his diet coke intake (which is 1-2 a day) but he just waves me off. So I did some research, read the reviews, and bought 2 packs of the cola and lemon flavor each. I tried both to see how they tasted and was totally confused by this tasteless carbonated water. There was no taste! It literally just tasted like carbonated water with a vague hint of some flavor. I can't imagine anyone WANTING to drink this stuff, let alone rave about it.<br /><br />Did I get a bad batch? My Dad will never be able to transition from diet coke to this stuff, cause this stuff is truly awful.<br /><br />So disappointing. :("
positive,25/5/21,I drink this tea to relax and for stomach and digestive problems. It works every time. Very calming and a good all-around tea time.
positive,7/9/21,"I purchased this to send to my son who's away at college. It was delivered right to his dorm room with very fast shipping. He loved it so much he called me to thank me, and sadly, he hardly ever calls me anymore! If you want your kids to call home, and have some good snack to get them through midterms then send them this."
positive,25/5/21,"These are really tasty. Wish I could read Chinese to get an idea of the nutritional information, including sodium and calories."
positive,22/5/21,"I started eating this after a recommendation by my hair stylist, who is into organic/healthy eating. I put 3 Tbsp on either my oatmeal or Ezekiel 4:9 cereal. It has a great nutty flavor. It is also loaded with nutrients."
positive,19/7/21,"This product is so perfect for flavored iced tea.  It is fantastic.  If you like flavored tea you'll love this added to your home brewed"
positive,7/9/21,"I purchase the strawberry version of the Crystal Light Energy line usually, but decided to give peach mango a try.  It was very good!  I drink this stuff everyday, and having a different flavor was an excellent change.  120 mg of caffeine per packet, and all the water you can drink.  No more of that canned energy crap for me!"
positive,25/8/21,"I like cream cheese but it is too heavy. This Valbreso feta cheese tastes great though. It is not heavy. I tried it in Salad, with toast for breakfast, with Pita bread. They all taste good."
positive,6/9/21,"Our Allsorts licorice arrived quickly - in time for a birthday surprise!  It's hard to find this great licorice anywhere locally, and when you do, it's very expensive.  We were delighted with the price, service and most of all - taste!"
positive,25/5/21,These are the BEST ginger chews on the market!  They are reasonably priced and very good.  I found them in my favorite store and then they stopped carrying them. I was so upset to loose them.  I turned to Amazon and found them again!  I never have to worry about finding them again!!
positive,7/9/21,It is a great tomato product. HOWEVER... Amazon has no clue how to package stuff. A carton twice the size of the inner package of cans with a few sheets of air bubbles. Dent city!!!<br /><br />It is my biggest complaint with Amazon - packing sucks
positive,13/10/21,"This is a terrific training treat.  It smells absolutely wonderful, is not greasy, can be cut into small pieces and my dog LOVES it!  She'll perform every trick she knows just to get a morsel of it. When I take her for a walk and carry the treats in my pocket, I have her full attention. Highly recommended!"
positive,2/10/21,I mix it with apple juice and throw a cup of honey nut cheerios into a blender with it and it taste fantastic. Love the product and planning on buying the 3 pound bag every time I run out!
positive,23/9/21,"Tastes much better than the whey protein powders I've tried in the past and doesn't leave a nasty aftertaste.  Blends well by simply shaking.  I use with almond or soy milk."
positive,26/6/21,"Not the most economical way to buy this, but the packets are convenient and the cheesy garlic is delicious without being overpowering."
positive,25/5/21,"I've been eating energy and protein bars for years.  Most are like flavored cardboard.  GFB bars don't just satisfy your hunger, they have outstanding taste and texture.  They aren't just for gluten free diets, but are a wonderful alternative snack for anyone.  Get some!!!"
positive,7/9/21,"This gum is very good.  I've been an Eclipse user for the past 5 years, and just happened on this gum from a sample.  It has a little something in it when you first chew it which sets it apart from other gums!"
positive,15/7/21,"I'm constantly using the glaze on everything and I really do like the taste and consistency. I was trying to find a replacement for the glaze Williams and Sonoma sells and this happened to be very close and for a better price."
positive,3/6/21,"This is by far the best tea I have ever had to drink.  I purchased my first cup at a Barnes and Nobles and could not wait to get home to find the tea on the internet and order.  Try it, if you like cinnamon you will love this tea.  Great hot or cold."
positive,27/9/21,Enjoy using this product in all my cooking most of all I enjoy ordering from Amazon- they have such great customer service.
positive,19/6/21,"Price is good along with the taste.  I like the dark, rich flavor.  Sealed well when shipped and received it quickly."
positive,25/5/21,"I love these bears because their sweetness is a bit more subtle than the regular gummy bears--I don't like things to be too sweet. That doesn't mean these guys are lacking in flavour, though...just that they taste more like fruit and less like sugar! They're chewier as well, which is something else I love--keeps me from eating too many at a time!"
positive,7/9/21,"My secret ingredient for soups, stews, meats, and any savory dish.  Now the same great flavor with NO salt!"
positive,3/8/21,"This is an easy to make cake and it tastes really good. It is almost the same as the Coffee Cake I usually buy at Seattles Best Coffee House which is more than $2.00 a slice. It is really worth it for the price you paid. My family really loved it, we even eat it at breakfast.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product, you can serve this on parties too, by using muffins pans. I usually use small bundt pans so my kids have their own individual cakes, they really love it!!!"
positive,5/9/21,"I started looking online for a milk alternative since I'm in college, need breakfast, and don't want to pay $4.50 for a half gallon of milk. I decided on Saco after reading reviews, and this stuff rocks. It tastes better, drinks fresher, and doesn't give me gas in the least bit. I'm never buying store milk again."
positive,25/5/21,"I was diagnosed with Celiac in May 2011.  There were few things I minded giving up but one was granola in my breakfast yogurt!  I found GF UDI's granola at a grocery store and it was $8 a bag, which is a lot when I eat it every morning!  So I was thrilled to find it at Amazon and at such a great price.  Worth ever penny - all flavors are great!  Vanilla is my favorite.  Thanks UDI's for making GF easy...."
positive,7/9/21,"I usually get orange and spice tea (not decaf)for hot tea and I was not sure about these flavors but I LOVE THEM and they are caffeine free! These will make great stocking stuffers for Christmas too!  I'm going to have to order more soon!"
positive,11/9/21,Great Coffee!!  I will reorder when I use what I have.  A great way to start the day is this coffee.
positive,13/7/21,"Nice smoky taste, which I like. I am having a hard time eating enough protein, so I thought this might help. It is soft (as commented on in other reviews), not the traditional pull with your teeth kind of jerky. I will be making a few concoctions with it - chopped in a bean salad, and crumbled on a baked potato.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for the gold box special so that I could try it."
positive,22/7/21,"Great tasting jerky, while the family likes the more traditional jerky I really have come to enjoy this hormone free jerky.  The sodium level is so much lower than most jerky brands so not brutal salt like most jerky."
positive,22/6/21,"I love this chai...it is the best on the market.  I was sick of spending $4 almost daily, so I decided to make them at home instead.  BEST CHOICE EVER!  I use hot water and frothed milk, sprinkle with cinnamon, and it tastes like my favorite bakery chai!  Also, I highly recommend this seller...I received the chai on the next business day.  Extremely satisfied customer."
positive,28/7/21,"This tub us expensive but when you think of the costs of this many fresh bananas it comes out less.  The taste is awesome as soon as you pop them into your mouth, the flavor comes out. They look a little funny dry but taste awesome.<br />My kids love junk food and when I bought these they going for handfuls instead of candy and did not stop until they were gone. I did not even get a chance to bake with them."
positive,13/10/21,"I enjoy these so much more than traditional (fried) banana chips.  They do really stick to your teeth a lot, but it's as sweet as candy (even without added sugar) so I wouldn't consider that a huge detriment. I didn't have a problem with stale or soggy fruit--the bag was well-sealed.  Watch out--it's easy to eat a lot of them!"
positive,19/2/21,"These taste great - who cares that they are also ""healthy""?  Dr. Kracker discontinued this flavor a few years ago - glad to see it's back."
positive,14/12/20,"One of my favorite brands of pasta!  Looks, cooks, tastes, texture... all like that of wheat pasta.  Wish it was a wee bit cheaper but not too bad in the world of gluten free food prices.  Highly recommended, you will not be disappointed."
positive,14/12/20,"This Kit Kat is way way way better than the US version....It is the same one that I used to eat in the middle east but it's very delicious and I do recommend it.<br /><br />the shipping was fast...the chocolate wasn't melted...and the packaging was good"
positive,19/2/21,"This is a tasty and economical product.<br />As our family has diabetic issues, I admit to being disappointed that two of the top ingredients are sugar."
positive,10/1/21,"We saw this featured on the Travel Network a while ago, so when I saw it available through Amazon I ordered it for my wife for Christmas. Very tasy and very unique."
positive,26/3/21,"I was brewing about 2 pots a day of Starbucks Columbian or other good Columbian coffees until recently at a relative that only had Folgers Instant. I reluctantly tried it and was amazed at the great taste. I couldnt believe how good it was and now I drink it everyday , even more than brewed coffee. I highly recommend trying this.!"
positive,24/3/21,"this is my favorite flavor of crystal lite but i couldn't find it anywhere, thankfully i could get a huge batch of it on amazon so it will last me quite a while. thank you!"
positive,24/2/21,This is probably the best tea I have had and this brand is always a winner.  So far I am still perfecting my taste with this particular tea but while I am experimenting looking for my perfect taste I have found it to be great weak or strong.  Depending on my mood I like strong tea sometimes but not bitter which can be a problem for tea whether to much or to little is used.  My advice would be perfect before you rate because you may just be making it wrong since I usually let my tea set longer than what is recommended to get my taste and my taste is different than anyone in my family.  They usually claim it is too strong with how much I use but for me it is perfect.  This is a pack of six so make sure you will like this kind before purchasing.
positive,19/2/21,"These light, crunchy crackers are free of eggs, dairy/casein, wheat/gluten, soy, corn, nuts, peanuts, sesame, and coconut - an allergen free dream! And, YUMMY!"
positive,14/12/20,We use it as a coating for fish. It comes out really great.<br />Amazon has the best price.
positive,19/10/21,I absolutely love this product!!!  I used to buy these at Trader Joes and have not been able to find them anywhere!  So happy to have found them again.
positive,18/5/21,"This was a crunchy, tasty snack! And it's vegan, so I will be buying it again."
positive,19/2/21,"I have given samples to my friends and they agree. I use one tablespoon per 4OZ cup of coffee. I use a 12 oz French press coffee maker and let the coffee brew for 4 minutes. Adjust the mix to your taste and you will not be disappointed. I'm looking forward to trying the the other Boyd's coffee blends."
positive,14/12/20,"I tried peach tea at a Cracker Barrel near me and loved it.  I found it here at Amazon and bought my 6 pack and have gone thru more than half in less than two months.  I love the taste and being instant, can be made very easily for a quick drink.  I think I like this better then ice tea with lemon even and that is a favorite.<br />Thanks for the good price Amazon and quick shipping."
positive,1/6/21,Like previous Crystal Light products this one is easy to use and mix and tastes great. Will plan on getting it again!
positive,1/4/21,"I always have been of Crystal Light products so I thought I'd give these a try... These taste great and are so easy to make!"
positive,15/4/21,"The soup is very tasty. I add flavor with dried parsley flakes, celery seed and lots of pepper. This is the second time I've received a shipment of Campbells's Healthy Choice Chicken Noodle soup. I am reluctant to order it again since almost every can was dented in the last batch. That said, I wish Amazon carried the Homestyle chicken noodle soup. I like that better as the noodles are smaller and firmer."
positive,19/5/21,These are very good!  I love to munch on them for a crunchy snack.  And they dissolve quick enough for my 17 month old to eat (most of) them.
positive,19/2/21,"I am always looking for something to take to the office to have for lunch.  I enjoy items that are different and have flavor.  This item was a pleasant surprise.  There was just enough Citrus flavor and spice to make this simple dish a nice treat for lunch.  I do wish the ingredients were listed before purchasing.  I am a vegetarian, preferring to be vegan.  This item does contain milk.  If you are a Vegan, then this item is one to overlook.  I do recommend adding a little brocolli, carrots, peas, or pea pods with this dish."
positive,14/12/20,"The mixed veggie pack is better, that's the only reason I gave this 4 stars. I'm not a fan of edamame but cruncha ma-me has made me one! The mixed veggie pack even my kids eat!"
positive,28/7/21,"I've just gone through my first box of this beef jerky, and it tastes really good.  My whole family likes it.  It's spicy, but not unbearable.  The sweetness tend to balance out the spiciness.  The only problem I had with my first order was that one of the bags was moldy.  Must be faulty packaging."
positive,29/6/21,"Very good to flavor broth. I got this kind, genmai, because I cannot have gluten grains. No reactions so far."
positive,15/10/21,"This is the best instant coffee I've ever tried. The aroma is rich and pure with a little caramelized flavor, no sour muddy tastes. I don't think it's pricey compare to other products and the quality I get. Absolutely worth every penny. The best drink to wake you up every morning! Don't hesitate, just try it!"
positive,20/7/21,I have tried three brands of almond butter so far and find Barney Butter has the best flavor.  Another had fewer ingredients and lower fat but I like BB best.
positive,12/10/21,The product was and is fantastic.  The people who made this possible by helping me be able to order this were absolutely fantastic!!!!!
positive,19/2/21,"Update: Was great at less than $6 with subscribe and save. Now, it's 16.99? Holy heck! No way!<br /><br />One of the few crunchy cookies that taste homemade. So much better than Chips Ahoy, you'll completely forget about them. No yucky after taste like Chips Ahoy. Plenty of chocolate chips made with real chocolate. Gasp. I love the mini size. Perfect for putting a few in a condiment bowl and covering with milk. My secret midnight snack, every now and then, of course. Comes in a huge 40 oz. bag that will last my family of 6 for a month. Hence, I set this up for monthly delivery and at their subscribe rate, who can beat that?"
positive,14/12/20,"This protein powder is absolutely delicious!<br />It blends well with no clumps, chunks, or residue.<br />It has a wonderful taste that I recognize from smoothies I've had at ""real"" smoothie bars.<br />My homemade smoothies now taste like I bought them from a shop!<br />I only wish I had bought the 28 oz bags instead of the 14 oz bags.<br />Will definitely correct that for next time!"
positive,2/7/21,"I originally purchased these to use as a fun gift for a 'secret sister,' and happened to be starving when they arrived in the mail today.  The crackers, cheese spread, and pepperoni were incredibly tasty!  The dried fruit complimented the trio well and the chocolate toffee was a perfect top-off.  I immediately got online to order another variety to try!  It seems like a small meal, but it has kept me full all afternoon.  I'm going to package two in a gift basket along with a bottled drink and some napkins--seems a napkin is the one thing the GoPicnic folks forgot!  They'll be perfect for an early fall afternoon in the park.  Hope the other 5 meals will make it to the gift wrapping stage!"
negative,11/3/21,Looking for a quick cook sticky toffee pudding these caught my eye. The only thing that resembles a sticky toffee pudding from this product though is the name. Bland tasting. A disappointment beyond words.
positive,10/4/21,"One of the best I've tasted!  Takes a bit longer to make but worth the effort!"
positive,22/7/19,"My son was nursed, and then we found out he was allergic to Cow's Milk.  I couldn't get him to drink any other milk alternative. He loves this product!  My only complaint is that it doesn't come in single serve sizes, so when we  travel, I am constantly carrying around the big container in a cooler. For day trips in the car this is fine, but this stinks for airplane travel.  I have tried to serve him the single serve of rice milk, but he simply will not drink as much as this.  He loves it!"
positive,2/2/20,Great taste and easy to carry with you for whenever you may want flavored water. The taste is not overpowering or too bland. I prefer this to just plain water.
positive,2/2/20,These cranberries are plump and taste great. They have a nice aroma and just the right amount of sugar. Great.
positive,31/8/19,"I am not a rice connoisseur and the Roland Thai Jasmine Rice is the first type of Jasmine rice I have ever tasted. To me, this rice looks like Basmati rice (long and thin grains). It cooks pretty well (turns fluffy) and fast in the microwave. I add 2 cups of water for every cup of rice - and the cooked rice looks like cooked Basmati rice! The rice tastes good too although I have to say I prefer the taste of real Basmati Rice.<br /><br />[...]"
positive,22/7/19,"These are my favorite dark chocolate.  I don't like overly sweet chocolates and love the combination of salt and dark chocolate.  These are very tasty and just the right size if you want to have a small daily dose of dark chocolate, but don't want to load up on calories."
positive,12/1/20,"We used to raise Montmorency cherries, and these dried cherries are the real deal. As dried fruit, they're perfect: moist, chewy, and wonderfully flavorful. They make a wonderfully energizing snack at the office. Though I generally don't like added sugar on dried fruits, it's really necessary to counteract the cherries' naturally tart taste. Reconstituted, I'm guessing they'd be perfect for tart cherry pies. Certainly the flavor is everything I remember in a really good tart cherry pie, which is almost impossible to find these days."
positive,19/2/20,"In the great British trifecta of British powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar, Horlicks the most malty, Milo is medium chocolately and malty, and Ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately.<br /><br />All 3 are basically comfort drinks when plain milk just won't do. All 3 are powders to which you add milk and sugar to get a sweet malty drink, the latter two with chocolate flavor as well.<br /><br />I love all 3 drinks. But, if you are drinking this for nostalgia's sake, make sure you get the Milo from where ever your nostalgia springs from because Milo is made in different countries and they all taste a little different. For me, I love Milo for it's good mix of chocolate and malt, not too much of either, and a great comfort drink for cold nights."
positive,27/11/19,"I made pumpkin bread for the first time a few weeks ago with some fresh pumpkin.  My husband needs to eat gluten-free, so we tried this baking mix instead of wheat flour.  It was DELICIOUS.  We all thought it was so wonderful that we bought 10 more pumpkins just so we can make more!  The only thing that I don't like is that it has a small amount of corn starch (in the baking powder) and my son is on a corn-free diet."
positive,12/12/19,"this meat is very fresh and taste very good. its already cooked,you just warm it up in the frying pan . its sliced thin.  its lot better than the one at the restaurants"
positive,26/9/20,"I've had a hard time figuring out the right amount to use, but this product tastes great! It was shipped quickly & packaged well."
positive,22/7/19,"this adds a great taste to your popcorn, its not easy to get the same measurement each time and removing it from the container provided is a bit of a task.<br />The price of this product is high, and even higher depending on your location(shipping costs are very high and are on the rise). this product does not yield as much popped corn as some other products.<br />But it still is the best for Taste, gives a great flavor from the initial popping and not adding any toppings."
positive,2/2/20,"If those dense, heavy nutrition bars are too rich for you to tolerate or if you can't handle them after a hard workout, this one is worth trying.  It's very tasty and light.  The wafers give it a nice texture and crunch and it will remind you of those creme wafer cookies from childhood but much tastier and with better nutrition.  I will say that if you're looking for a ""super bar"" this may not be ideal because it does have a little more fat in it than other bars I like and a bit less protein and carbs, but it's worth buying because it tastes really good, it's light and easy to digest.  For me, this is a great meal replacement bar/snack or great after a light to moderate workout."
positive,23/5/20,I chose this product as I am not crazy about chocolate flavoured products. This goes well with coffee and good if you are in a hurry. It keeps me full till lunch time. I worry about the fat content however. I probably would need an input from a dietician regarding that.
positive,22/11/20,"I really like all the power bars flavors.  Great for when you want a snack but don't want all the bad stuff that comes with other protein bars.  I also like the crunch. when I'm craving chocolate it really hits the spot and dulls my cravings."
positive,30/3/20,I like this product because it basically does what I anticipated. As long as you have a full glass of water with it it will keep you feeling full for a few hours.
positive,8/7/20,"I have tried lots of different protein bars but the main problem is always the same, they taste like protein bars. This is my favorite because it tastes like eating a normal chocolate waffer candy bar. Chocolate is my favorite, followed by peanut butter. Great for a snack, I take one with me when I go out with friends so I have a tasty healthy treat."
positive,4/1/20,These energy bars taste great and come in a variety of flavors. They are low in carbs which is what I need.
positive,30/1/21,Seriously?? 5 calories!?! These are so good. And even better if you add a little bit to them if you know what I mean! :)
positive,2/11/20,"I have been trying all kinds of ""diet"" drinks because I am getting tired of just water all the time. So many diet drinks have a strong after taste, or no flavor at all. I have always liked Crystal Light drinks, but have been hoping for some new flavors. These new Moctails flavors are great! They have a very different flavor from their other mixes. The Mojito flavor is refreshing and has a wonderful taste. I definitely recommend you try all the Moctails flavors - you won't be dissapointed."
negative,17/10/20,This did not tickle my taste buds. I really wanted to like it but will go back to the Crystal Light lemonade.
positive,22/7/19,"I was pleasantly surprised at the new Crystal Light drink mixes.  The mojito flavor tastes a lot like the real thing.  There is a strong lime taste and sort of an after taste of a kick of mint.  This was my second favorite of the three varieties available, but it was pretty tasty and a nice change of pace."
positive,2/2/20,"I haven't crystal light since it was still made with saccharin, but I have been wanting to lose some weight and stop drinking so many sugary drinks, but it's  hard being most diet sodas end up giving me a headache.  Anyway, I went out on a limb and I tried it.  It was delicious, you could hardly even taste the artificial sweetener and the flavor was yummy.  I don't drink alcohol, so I have never had a real mojito but this had just the right amount of mint to add a little something to the lime.  I have tried a recipe from Paula Deen for a honeydew limeade with mint and it's one of the best drinks I've ever had, but it's also loaded with sugar and with all the fruit it ends up costs 8-10 bucks a pitcher so I usually only make it once or twice a summer, but this has the same flavors of mint, lime and a sweetness.  If only they added some honeydew, but then it won't be a mojito I guess.<br /><br />I will definitely be getting it again, and it didn't even give me a headache like diet soda does.<br /><br />5 stars."
positive,4/10/20,"I enjoy many other flavors of crystal light, but I got bored of them all for a long time. Recently I bought a container of the Mojito flavor and I'm hooked!  Great taste, like a children's version of a mojito.  I drink a lot more water/liquid each day because of these little packets.  Great alternative to diet soft drinks and water."
positive,1/4/20,"Ideal is the right name for this. Low Calorie - yes. Sweetener - absolutely. No funky aftertaste. Acts just like sugar, and tastes like it too."
positive,8/5/20,"Ok this salt is a must have if you really like to cook. I think it has a good flavor and the price is really good. Even if you don't use it everyday it is good to add to your spices."
positive,18/6/20,"The coffee is excellent, easy to order and always arrives in a short period of time.  Love the convienence and am about to enjoy a fresh cup this morning.  We used to have coffee made in a drip coffee pot but by the time we would have a second cup the coffee lost much of it's taste and at times tasted burnt.  Never happens with Keurig coffee."
positive,20/8/20,"I take these for snacks & sometimes just for lunch . Very filling , can carry in your pocket with no mess.Love the flavor."
positive,1/6/21,"These are great tasting bars. I could eat them all day, but the problem is that they are not filling at all. You eat one and it doesn't feel like you ate anything at all, which is why I have to give it 4 stars instead of one."
positive,4/7/21,"I purchased these bars as a meal replacement after a job during lunch.  The texture is a bit hard (moat if not all protein bars are hard) but these Special K Protein Bars tastes great!  With 10 grams of protein per bar, it is a much better alternative then other snacks out there.  I only have other protein bars that I use as meal replacements after a workout or job and these Special K bars tastes the best to me.  I will be buying more!"
positive,5/2/20,"I saw that 1 star rating and thought ""there's no way the folks at Buffalo Bills could produce a beef stick rated one out of five."" I bought them because of that one star and I was right, its a 5 star snack just like everything else they sell. It is much better than any common Slim Jim or Jack Links beef stick."
positive,22/7/19,"I got a bag of this free at PAX 2009 and was really surprised how good it was. I mean, gamers generally don't eat well, but I like this better than most trail mix."
positive,2/2/20,"This was great, I was not expecting jam to taste this good, I will never switch back, the only reason I do not use it every day is because I dont want to run out of it."
positive,22/11/20,"This stuff is delicious!  The flavor tastes like a combination of grape juice and cranberry juice.  It has just the right amounts of sweetness and tartness.  The size of each packet makes it perfect for adding to a bottle of spring water, or a bottle of filtered water from home.  The little ""stix"" are very convenient and easy to open.  Best of all, it has no sugar, no carbs, and no calories.  A great way to jazz up your water without messing up your diet."
positive,1/3/20,"There's a very nice watermelon flavor to these candies.  If I had any complaint...and I really don't...it would be that I'd prefer the candies individually wrapped.  Otherwise, I'm pleased with my selection."
positive,23/11/20,"I eat this many times a week. It's flavorful and great texture. I'd eat it even if I weren't gluten free."
positive,5/4/21,"Great tasting and the added benefit is the fiber! My son loves granola, granola bars, etc. And with GF products it's really hard to find sources of fiber, this is wonderful and it has fiber!"
positive,27/4/20,"I rarely find this product in the grocery store in my rural town so I decided to make the online purchase.  Kraft Honey Hickory Smoke Barbecue Sauce is a mild, sweet sauce - nothing fancy but I really like it."
positive,8/3/21,"It's so hard to find gluten free foods that taste good.  This one is really delicious.  And it's easy to make!"
positive,30/1/20,"Narnia???<br /><br />I first had Turkish delight while I was in Turkey.  There, shops produce Turkish delight and hundreds of other exotic treats fresh.  Every town of more than a few thousand people seems to have at least one of these shops. The sweetness of Turkish delight varies by shop in its native homeland, and this confection is a fine example, so long as one doesn't eat all that sugar sifting around in the box.  I think there's so much so it will act as a natural preservative.<br /><br />If you can't fit a quick trip Turkey to get the genuine article hand-made fresh, then this is the best imported substitute I've tried.  I wouldn't trust getting something like this from a regular retailer because of potential shelf-life issues, and I wouldn't trust confections obtained from a discount clothing outlet, but on-line through Amazon I trust.<br /><br />Tangentially, if you like Turkish delight, you owe it to yourself to visit the country of origin, because there's many other delicious Turkish confections you probably haven't experienced."
negative,22/7/19,Would not recommend this product to anyone because it had chemical taste which my guests complained about when I served on a buffet type dinner. I was so embarrassed!
positive,2/2/20,"Obviously ""taste"" is subjective. I wanted to add my opinion and 5 stars to the tally to this item because I believe it is worth it."
positive,2/9/20,"Wanted organic walnuts and now I have them.  Convenient that they are in 3 separate bags so I don't have to open at one time.  Good tasting, bits and halves."
positive,26/1/21,"This is an excellent soy free alternative to peanut butter. I even bake with it.  I make ""peanut"" butter cookies that people would swear are real peanut butter with this product.  It's definitely not a ""No-Stir"" product though.  It does arrive separated.  The oil tends to rise to the top and so it does need to be stirred from time to time.  This is still a fabulous product.  My children adore it."
positive,9/1/21,"I agree with previous review - these don't resemble scallops in any way, but they are very good. I don't understand why they are so hard to find.<br /><br />Recipe suggestion: cook ramen noodles, throw in a handful of chopped skallops when the noodles are almost cooked (just long enough to heat them up), drain most of the water then add the spice packet.  Not very classy but good and quick."
positive,30/7/21,Brewing this coffee took me back to my trip to Kona and visiting the coffee plantations.  Drinking a cup of this brew is the next best thing to being there!
positive,30/10/20,"Great strong tasting gum BUT doesn't last long BUT is still worth it especially if your not allowed to have regular sf gum! The cinnamon taste is very great!"
positive,3/8/20,"Although it is a bit alarming to have these given a 5 star review by a cheesewhiz afficianado, (a condiment competing for most vile non-food item on the supermarket shelf imo), these actually are really fabulous. They have a mealy texture and great oaty/oily taste that is better than any other oat cake I have tried, and better than any other cracker too. My babies also love them and as non wheat products are suitable for the young and for the allergic."
positive,29/1/21,"I love these crackers and keep them on hand all the time.  They are great for soups, cheese and cracker snacks, to spread peanut butter on,  just plain, or ..... They are like chips ... can't eat just one !! I have them on subscribe & save and they always arrive safely and on-time.  A bit of trivia: our parrots love them as snacks, too !!"
positive,24/10/21,"This pasta was very good! I was a bit skeptical at first about the pre-cooked pasta in a container that did not need to be refrigerated, but I ate it and had no ill side effects :)<br /><br />The instructions to heat up the pasta and sauce were simple and because it's not a frozen meal, it only took about 1:30 in the microwave. The pasta was cooked well. The sauce, while simple marinara, was really good. Just enough seasoning to make it taste good without taking away from the great tomato taste. The marinara was also chunky and not pureed or watery or runny.<br /><br />Overall a very good product that I would eat again."
negative,24/10/21,"i think these peppercorns are bland, tasteless, it lacks the pepper spiciness, will never buy this brand again.It was a fail choice to say the least"
positive,16/10/21,"My Japanese grandma drinks a homemade mix of apple cider vinegar and bananas for health and this drink is black, pungent and quite frightening. HongCho vinegreat is a great alternative and actually tastes really good! Don't let the ""vinegar"" scare you off - it is really quite sweet and you just get a little hit of the tang going down. I guess it really depends on how much you dilute it. I believe the package says 1:3 for a strong taste or 1:4 or 1:5 for a lighter taste. I've tried both the Pomegranate and Blueberry flavors and they were both good. You can also mix the concentrate with milk, yogurt or even make a salad dressing out of it.<br /><br />The bottle recommends drinking after a work out, after a bath or before bed. The purported benefits of drinking vinegar including overall well being, improvement in digestion, speeding up metabolism and skin benefits. I've only been drinking this for a short time so I can't really say if I've noticed any difference in health.<br /><br />As far as the Amazon price, I got a smokin deal at my local H Mart and picked up a bottle for only $6. The regular price is $10/bottle so the Amazon price isn't too bad, especially if you don't have a Korean grocery store nearby."
positive,24/10/21,Tea has a great flavor besides a lot of health benefits. It is mild tasting not strong at all. (Here are a lot of bags in box so lasts a while.
positive,25/9/21,Used these cones for a back to school ice cream social. Everyone thought they were great. I would buy them again.
positive,19/10/21,I bought this for Halloween treats. Ordered it on the 8th and it came on the 10th! Great service. I like this candy bar better than the Butterfinger bar which seems to fall apart when taking the bar out of the wrapper.The chocolate seems to be a better grade in the Clark bar.
positive,20/10/21,Great coconut oil! Purchased this to use when making my own popcorn & it is great.  My whole family loves the taste.  After buying this I read that virgin coconut oil is the most healthy for popcorn & was thrilled to get it & see that it is virgin coconut oil.  Love it!  Hope it comes in a larger container for next time!
positive,19/10/21,I have ordered this 3 times now. My son in Afghanistan requested some of this to be sent to him. He loves it! It is a little salty but if you eat with low salt or no salt tortilla chips it tastes great! You will love it.
positive,15/6/21,"When you follow the cooking directions it's excellent. If you don't cook it into the pasta the flavor is ruined"
positive,4/8/21,"if u compare to buying the 3 packs at walmart, its a great price. 4 of the 3 packs from walmart are $26+, this is $15<br /><br />the flavor is the best ive ever had. i like spearmint but then a friend gave me a piece of this and its way better"
positive,4/8/21,"I had never tried green tea powder before, but decided to get some after reading some reviews on smoothies and healthy drinks. Since I make about 4 to 5 smoothies a week, I thought this would be a great addition to my different recipes. I was a little surprised at how small the can was when I received it. I don't know why since it is only 1.4 oz which is a fairly small size. It is a bit pricey for the size, but worth the money if you really enjoy green tea or use it as a health enhancer."
positive,18/7/21,"I'm not sure what else to say, but it is a very tasty syrup.  It comes in a pretty standard bottle, but it was packet very well and arrived in fine shape."
negative,18/10/21,"This is fine. It's just not all that.<br /><br />Perhaps if I had special equipment that would make it without getting little floaties in my cup, I would have given it more stars. (I used a fine mesh strainer and poured the boiling water through twice). And perhaps if I didn't get an unimaginable headache a half hour or so after drinking it...I might have gone for three stars. (Unsure whether this caused the headache--I have to try it one more time). But, the end result tasted like tea...nothing special and at 11.70 per bag--uh, I'd rather go for Celestial Seasonings if I want some caffeine-free tea-beverage-drink.<br /><br />SO if you have an espresso machine and want to branch out into tea, this might be for you--otherwise go for some loose-leaf and steep the hell out of it."
positive,15/6/21,"Eden foods puts out the best tasting pumpkin seeds. These are shelled (shell removed). These Spicy ones don't have much more flavor than the regular ones, but enough to make them worth getting instead of the regulars. They are not hot at all. Oh,... and the best thing about these.... They are MSG free!"
positive,4/8/21,I like anything by this  company and wish more flavors available from amazon.  the apple cinnamon is very versatile and makes especially good iced tea also.
positive,8/6/21,"Can be eaten on its own, not salty at all with each single serving porch."
positive,15/6/21,"Very tasty bacon, smoky sauce for eggs, hamburgers, non bacony items that could use some ""bacon goodness"". Hubby is thrilled. Not a spicy hot sauce. Cool that it's veggie friendly."
positive,4/8/21,"""Dead Heat"" is the finest quality ""Gucci"" hot sauce I've ever tried.  And I'm an experienced hot sauce aficionado.<br /><br />It's hot enough to be powerul (use one drop at a time), yet not so hot as to be dangerous to the touch or unusuable for cooking.  People who make hot wings at home, and who are looking for a superior hot sauce to add a measured heat to your wings...this is your sauce!<br /><br />Very, very good."
positive,25/9/21,I like this mixture very much.  It could be less expensive but for taste and quality it is worth the price.
positive,19/10/21,"Marley's Mellow Mood is fantastic, not only does it taste great but it really works, best thing since sliced bread, I highly recommend you try some."
positive,4/9/21,"Soft, flavorful and fun; I feel a little goofy eating these 30 inch long Fruit Rolls - but they do taste great!"
positive,31/8/21,"We were getting these for free at work. We stopped getting them so I went to smart and final to buy my own. My local Smart and Final did not have them so I ordered a box from Amazon! Can't wait to get them they are a great snack!"
positive,9/10/21,"I don't generally care too much for the healthy alternatives, especially when it comes to coffee. However, after trying Truvia at a hotel, I am now hooked. I usually get it at the grocery store, but it is good to see that it is available on Amazon, and now that I have Prime, I might just be getting it online instead.<br /><br />This sweetener tastes really good, and in addition to coffee, I have had it with desserts and it tastes great. I think it even tastes better than sugar, and definitely tastes better than splenda.<br /><br />I cannot comment as to the health aspects related to artificial sweeteners, but I'm sure that there is plenty of information available on the Internet related to that.<br /><br />As a casual coffee drinker, I highly recommend Truvia! However, you may want to try one of the smaller box sizes before purchasing a larger quantity, just be sure that you like it."
positive,15/6/21,i first tasted this coffe at a casino and was delighted with the wonderful taste. it has good flavor and is very affordable  i highly recommend it
positive,4/8/21,"Perhaps I did not read the packaging well. This is a lot of candy.<br />The toffee melts in your mouth and the chocolate is well done.<br />I ended up taking two of the over stuff packages to work where they disappeared in two days.<br />Wow, this Heath is really delicious, not one bar was broken."
positive,15/6/21,"Great taste and easy to make in very little time, great when adding raisins and whatever your likes and variations may be."
positive,4/8/21,"Love Dreamfields Pasta.  Can't get the lasagna noodles where I live so I was so happy to find them at Amazon.<br />Delivery was quick.  The only thing is the noodles got broken in shipment which was a dissappointment."
positive,15/6/21,"Overall, the product is fantastic and the coffee is great! I am giving a review of 4 stars only because Amazon's advertising is misleading, it does not come in the advertised box, as someone else indicated, it's an unmarked box with 3 smaller bags on the inside.<br /><br />It is not a ""plastic K kup"", the product that you receive is what is pictured, with a filter type bottom. It does fit in your Keurig and brews just fine.<br /><br />I love the aroma and the taste of this coffee, reminded my husband and I of espresso we had in Siily, Italy a few years ago."
positive,4/8/21,"The first thing I would like to say is that the bottom of the k cup is a mesh not plastic but it still goes in my keurig machine just like a regular plastic bottom k cup. I don't understand what the fuss is all about.  It does look a little different from what you may be used to seeing, but works just the same. Now as to the taste of the coffee, I think that it is a full body flavor. If I want a strong taste I brew regular size amd if I wish to have a milder flavor I will brew the largest cup size, I have the best of both worlds. I immediately went on subscribe and save.  I order 5 boxes at a time.  Love the flavor of this coffee.  Now to my complaint. I notice today that the price of each box has increased approximately $2.54 a box and that is within about three weeks time. Now I really love the convenience of my Keurig, however eventually the price of the k cups will reach a price that will cause me to say NO MORE. That time is approaching quickly. This brand started out to be more reasonable than most, but with this price jump in the last three weeks I am afraid they (the company) will soon be way overpriced as are the other brands.  Again I will say I do love the flavor of this coffee. Did I mention my husband likes it as well and he normally does not like decaf coffee."
positive,1/10/21,"We've tried alot of the Josef products... they're all absolutely delicious.  Glad to see Amazon is offering them as they can be hard to find.  Their cookies fit the bill for those with allergies to multiple ingredients -- but you'd never know they were allergy friendly from the taste.  They're worth the price.  (I can serve them to guests -- kids and adults alike -- and they never know the difference!)"
positive,1/7/18,"At a couple bucks a bag indulge yourself!  Heavy with the caramel and the flavor, a bit light on the nuts-but they are in there.  The cranberries are a very nice touch if you like something chewy with your caramel corn.  Comparable to Poppycock but a bit more flavor and lighter on the nuts, a very good change of pace."
positive,10/8/18,This has one of the best taste out there on the market.  I wish it would go on subscribe and save.
negative,1/7/18,"I usually use Twinings English breakfast loose tea.  This was a poor substitute for that.  This tea has a strong, earthy taste, almost like dirt rather than tea."
negative,10/8/18,"I usually choose english breakfast tea because it has a rich flavor.  This tea was practically tasteless. I could go out in my back yard and randomly pick weeds and it would taste better than this stuff.  I recommend Taylors of Harrogate if you're looking for english-style tea."
positive,13/9/18,"I bought this for my wife and she loves it, so I'll give it a 4/5.<br /><br />This isn't just tea, there is powdered milk involved too.  I was surprised, so if that isn't your thing..."
positive,17/7/18,"I've never been much of a fan hazelnut, but I do enjoy drinking the International Hazelnut Non-Dairy creamier mixed into my morning cup of coffee."
positive,16/1/19,"Great flavor, and a good start to my morning.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E6EE4C"">Fiber One Honey Clusters, 14.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>"
positive,16/1/18,"Finally a High Fiber cereal that tastes great!! I like mixing the Honey Cluster with either the Carmel or the Raison Cluster for an even Higher Fiber load. And the lowest price I've found these cereals in on Amazon.com (we all love saving money while being healthy, right?). Try it for 3 days and I'm sure you'll love it like I do. Thanks and have a healthy day!!!"
positive,16/1/19,"Although they are a bit expensive, every now and then these candies are worth considering. I wish they sold them in the states because they are so unique in both taste and texture."
negative,1/8/20,"I love chocolate shakes and malts and I'm playing around with ingredients to achieve flavor with fewer calories. I bought some Carnation Malted Milk to add to the mix and make a malt. Unfortunately, this stuff had no malt flavor that I could detect and it made the result undrinkable. I'm throwing away the rest of the bottle."
positive,1/7/18,"The pomegranate flavor in this tea makes it a winner. It has that little bit of extra ""something"" that you just need sometimes when you drink a lot of tea. Something different. A different flavor. If you like to eat pomegranates, you'll like this. If you're not a fan of the fruit, you probably won't be a fan of this tea. It has that little bit of zing that the fruit has, and it's just perfect to drink while watching the sunrise."
positive,10/8/18,I thought that this was a very tasty treat.  Very comparable to non-gluten free ones I have<br />had in the past before finding out I was gluten intolerant
positive,15/2/20,"FantasiCakes sent my cake FAST, and it was also sent MOIST!!  For me it's hard to go wrong with chocolate, but this cake really is fantastic! The icing comes on the side so you can warm it up and drizzle it on at your leisure. I really liked that because I don't normally like a lot of icing. LOVE IT!"
positive,22/4/21,"These are excellent, don't taste sugar free at all. They taste just like the regular version and they are sweetened with Splenda with no chemical sweeteners. They're a little pricey but make a good treat."
positive,25/9/20,Great taste. Candy gets a gooey texture after sitting on counter. Wrapper sticks to candy. Other than that the candy is perfect.
positive,16/11/19,"I always avoided salt and then I learned about the difference between table salt and sea salt.  This tastes great on meat, a little on eggs... you name it I am using it.  I love the 2lb bag and the cost is very fair.  Cheaper than buying at a store."
positive,9/9/20,"For an all natural diet drink, this is amazing. It has a better taste then most other Rootbeers that are found in stores and is better for you! I originally didn't realize this was diet when I bought it, but I don't mind at all! It is actually much better in my opinion then the non-diet version, but its up to you!<br /><br />Note: This is really only a good deal if you get free shipping through Amazon Prime, because when these are on sale in stores, they cost about the same (give or take $1-$3)"
positive,1/7/18,"I grew up in Portugal eating the real thing, fresh, grilled sardines, and these are very close to that.  They're the best that I have found in this country.  Highly recommend. PLus, it's great that they are in olive oil."
positive,10/8/18,"I love Zevia soda, it has a weird aftertaste for some but I am in love with this soda that is good for you!  It does have a very citrusy taste!"
positive,15/1/20,"I ordered this syrup on a whim and I made the right choice, it's very tasty."
positive,1/9/20,"I have been eating this for years but it is hard to find in the regular grocery stores so I purchased it over the web.  It is great for a fast, tasty meal.  We add bite sized chicken breast to it and it is plenty for 2-3 people."
positive,22/7/21,This coffee has a smoother and more mellow taste than less expensive brands such as Folgers and Maxwell House.  And this is a terrific price compared to grocery store prices.
positive,1/7/18,"This is a fantastic chocolate bar, you can't even tell it is dairy free. This is NOT a milk chocolate flavor, it tastes more like a marriage of milk and dark chocolate. I am actually not usually a fan of dark chocolate but this is not overwhelmingly dark at all, it is perfect."
positive,10/8/18,"This particular flavor of Folger's gourmet coffee didn't turn out to be my favorite in their Gourmet line, but it was pretty good nonetheless. All of their flavors are good."
positive,14/5/21,"Exactly what Thai Iced tea should be. I love how each tea bag is individually wrapped allowing me to take the tea anywhere for me to brew. Keep in mind, packaging can be misleading though showing the tea with milk. This tea doesn't have milk in it and you'll need to add it yourself. Aside from that, the product itself is excellent though."
positive,17/10/19,"Very tasty, great color. Recipe on back may be a little too spicy for a Thai food virgin. Start with 1/2 amount."
positive,3/10/21,"Stocked up for work when it was on sale @ 1.73 per package. Good for emergencies but wouldn't buy it otherwise."
negative,15/9/20,"This jam tastes as if it was made of anything but roses.  No aroma at all.<br />By the time you pay for the shipping, may as well buy something else in the local grocery store."
positive,30/8/20,"First time Id ever purchased whole nutmeg, and I am glad that I did!  It is so much better than already ground nutmeg, lasts longer and it quiet simple to use with a good microplane grater!"
positive,1/7/18,Just a little pricy but worth having.  Made from corn much better than the rice  If you haven t tried this I would strongly suggest you give it a  try and by buying it 12 at a time it also saves you money
positive,10/8/18,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FK63LK"">Tinkyada Brown Rice Penne Pasta with Rice Bran, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>Tinkyada makes pasta that actually tastes like pasta. I have tried many different brands and nobody comes close to Tinkyada. If you are allegeric to wheat you can have great tasting pasta again."
positive,5/12/19,"This is the best gluten free pasta I've eaten.  Best of all my kids love it."
negative,21/10/19,"This made us sick.  Perhaps we got a bad batch.  We won't purchase this again and would not recommend it.<br />Would like to add that Amazon Customer service was awesome in our correspondence with this product!"
positive,8/9/20,"I am really a huge advocate of cooking from scratch, with all fresh ingredients, but I really love these seasoning packets especially the one for pork.<br /><br />This has not only nice flavors, but a bit of thickening.  I use it whenever I make split pea soup (one packet of this per 1lb bag of peas and only use half the amount of water they say to use on the bag of peas...beautiful, thick split pea soup every time!) or a pot of beans with ham shanks and it always comes out beautifully flavored.  I don't add salt when I use this but other herbs can be used, of course, with fantastic results.<br /><br />This comes in several other flavors now, but this is the one that I use the most.  Just store the packets in airtight containers, such as Lock & Lock, and they keep practically forever."
positive,22/9/21,This product is fantastic.  I have had Creme Brulee many times in France and this is just the same!<br />I would recommend it to anyone and my guests have just loved it.
positive,2/10/20,"I am allergic to peanuts, but I can eat all other nut butters.  I like the taste of this product, and the soy bits give it a texture like crunchy peanut butter.  I recommended it for those who are allergic to peanuts."
positive,25/7/20,The lemon flavor was evident in this product.The price was right and just big enough to satisfy our needs.Would buy again.
positive,4/7/21,We keep a box of these in our supply bin in the back of our vehicle for snacks on the go.  Yummy!
positive,11/9/21,"I was first turned onto this product from a review from Cook's Illustrated whose American Test Kitchen rated them the best tasting.  They are absolutely the best tasting.  They cost more but it is worth it for the end result.  And they're organic to boot."
positive,4/7/21,"I first found this product in the checkout lines at Austrian groceries. When I returned back to the US, I ordered this from Amazon to share with co-workers.  They are espresso-filled chocolates and are quite good.  I had to warn co-workers to put the entire thing in their mouth, because the espresso is liquid and will drip out if you bite.  My colleagues snapped them up quickly and we were energized for the rest of the day!  I had to hide them from my 6 year old because she liked them, too, and would climb anywhere to find them.  She already has enough energy."
positive,21/9/21,"Pilao is my favorite coffe. I have tried several brands from around the globe but so far this is the best tasting. Not bitter, nice and smooth."
positive,11/9/21,I usually drink green tea and have used this tea during the summer for iced tea and love the taste.  Very refreshing and prefer this over the store bran green tea.
positive,12/10/21,"This is a very tasty flavored coffee.  The flavor is not overpowering, and provides an extra little kick of awesomeness."
positive,11/10/21,"This coffee has a rich flavor and nice body without any bitterness, no matter what kind of machine you use. I enjoy it at all  ties of day but especially in the afternoon or after a good meal. Exceptional depth. I love my Illy coffee."
positive,28/9/21,"The South Beach Diet Bar (Dark Chocolate) offer a tasty but relatively healthy treat.  It has a rich though not overly sweet taste and is fiber rich while low on calories.  Don't expect it to taste like candy - this is a granola bar, after all - but it does offer a rare treat for those trying to lose weight.  While the heavier fiber intake may make it a little bit of an acquired taste, the chocolate makes it a lot easier to acquire.  If the rest of losing weight could only be this easy!"
positive,19/10/21,I bought this because of the antioxidants will keep it for the taste. Tastes like Arabica without being overwhelming. Its the best of both worlds when you can have a product that is good for you and tastes great too.
positive,4/7/21,My wife has me order this item for her. We look like we are a small convinece store in our garage This is the only product she has found to have NO SWEETNER in it so it has flavor but 0 calories and no FAKE sweetner either. IF you get bored drinking water try Hint This flavor is her favorite
negative,11/9/21,"I just got my order today and had to try it out.<br />While I'll disagree with others that have gotten 'mush' outta the can, my initial can was above that.<br />Not what I would call chunks by any stretch, but not mush.<br /><br />As for taste? Pretty much none. If it weren't for the additives, it wouldn't have any taste at all.<br /><br />I've never had Blue crab. But if this is the 'comparison', I'll not try it either.<br /><br />Keep in mind that I can get Dungeness year round, as well as Red Rock crab.<br /><br />I'll likely add it to the cats food. Maybe she can get some flavor out of it?"
positive,12/9/21,This product was nicely packaged which made it easy to throw in my purse or briefcase. The flavor was rich and satisfying. I will buy this again
positive,13/7/21,"Simply put, this stock has more flavour than most of the other options. It will add depth to your soups and sauces. If the flavour is too strong you can thin it down with a little water.<br /><br />As a bonus, it is consistently well priced on Amazon and you don't have lug it from the grocery store."
positive,23/10/21,"This is the best tasting hot sauce ever, yes hot sauce with a flavor ,my first bottle of this sauce came from a VERY VERY good friend when I found out what grocery store it came from i bought all they had now they tell me they cant get it anymore :( so where do i go? Amazon , but shipping for 2 bottles of this fine hot sauce is more than the sauce its self ,"
positive,22/9/21,I was very disappointed when Target stopped selling these.  I bought this pack of 12 bags and they were just like from the store.  Good buy.
positive,4/7/21,"I love granola and sometime add rasins or nuts but this stuff was good just as is, in a bowl with milk or right from the bag."
positive,11/9/21,Not too much to say.  This worked perfectly in our little fondue fountain and tasted great.  Lots of good feedback from our friends.
negative,8/8/21,"The Badia Cilantro, 0.25-Ounce (Pack of 12) has very little taste and, what flavor there is, doesn't resemble cilantro.  It is reminiscent of a stale oregano.  This was a very disappointing purchase and I won't be buying any Badia products again."
positive,9/7/21,"One of my guilty pleasures.  I've had baklava from many places and of many types.  I'm less enthused about those made with rose or orange flavored sugar water, and love that made with honey.  These are a spiced honey and walnut combination.  For those who prefer pistachios, however, these may not impress."
positive,24/10/21,"This is a wonderful tasting turkey broth that is so convenient. It is very shelf stable so it's handy to keep around, the packaging takes up little room in a small kitchen. It will be great in stuffing and gravy and will save me the time of always having to make stock before having turkey, which I always do. As soon as it arrived I put a cup of water into the microwave to boil and then added the contents of the little packet to the water, the taste was more than I expected from a convenience product. With the addition of some fresh herbs, turkey drippings and flour, you'll be having everyone at the table thinking you're a gourmet chef! I'll be adding a few packs to the stock I make from the turkey carcass this year, it will only help intensify that great turkey flavor. I'll order this again in the future but for right now the amount I have on hand should last quite a while."
positive,4/7/21,"I bought this on whim one day while shopping. The unusual flavor interested me. When I popped it, the wonderful smell of lime filled the kitchen. The taste is great! Not over powering but refreshing & tasty. This would go great on a summer day or night with margaritas or beer. Great new flavor! Would never have thought of adding lime to popcorn but it works!"
positive,11/9/21,"Great price for a quick and healthy side! Wasn't sure if I liked ""whole wheat"" couscous, but it tastes great."
positive,24/10/21,The kids love these.  They are very tasty and healthier than most toaster pastries.
positive,22/6/21,This granola has a great taste and texture.  It is one of my favorite desserts.  All the Bakery on Main granolas have wonderful flavor.
positive,30/7/21,Very tasty product..good for you and tastes good..great combo.<br /><br />I love it over the top of vanilla yogurt..yummmy
positive,10/7/21,"I ordered this cereal for my son who has some minor food allergies. He likes it, but I'm hooked! In my opinion, this cereal is the perfect blend; sweetened, but not too sweet; nutty, but not overwhelmingly so; good for you,and just plain delicious. I eat it with milk or as a snack without milk."
positive,4/7/21,"This product is really good. My baby loves it every time!!! He can eat it by itself as breakfast, lunch or dinner! I also sometimes mix it with my homemade food when I need to improve its texture or flavor (too spicy, too lumpy e.t.c). Great healthy option no matter how you want to offer it to your baby or toddler."
positive,11/9/21,"The Tempura was a gift for a host. They reported great taste. There really isn't much else to say about it. I would order again based on taste and service."
positive,20/9/21,"It seems like a lot, but they're great... especially if you have kids.  I know consumer waste isn't a good thing with individual packaging, etc., but I REALLY like these individually packaged snacks.  I usually buy a normal box at the store, but this has been so nice.  We always keep a bag handy for trips & snack time.  It's so convenient."
positive,13/10/21,These are great for packing lunches or snacks on the go without all of the bad stuff you get in the other commercially available products.  Great price with the free shipping over $25 too.  Will definitely buy again.
positive,2/8/21,"Very clean and light. 0 calories.  I've only used it in coffee, but it would probably be good over ice cream too. My friend joked you could put it in the bath, but I think that actually might be a good idea. Haven't tried it yet, but since it's made with Splends, not sugar, you probably could get a nice peppermint bath!  Haha. Weird. As a coffee flavor it is very nice!  By the way, the bottles are plastic, not glass, in case you were wondering."
positive,11/6/21,"I love pineapples and these are wonderful.  They taste great, are easily portable and need no refridgeration which is good during the summer.  I also like the apple and Asian pears.  Not so cray about the strawberry bananas and the potato crisps"
positive,2/8/21,"This honey is very spreadable, more like jelly than honey, and very tasty. The jar it comes in may be small, but it is more than worth the price."
positive,18/10/21,"These are incredibly good. I can't seem to keep a package of these around very long. My family and friends seem to get to them if I don't."
positive,23/7/21,I have never been disappointed with a Cafe Excellence Product.  This has a nutty vanilla flavor with no oily aftertaste like so many flavored coffees have.
positive,8/7/21,"Let your puppy naw on these for a month each. They will last for months. Alot less expensive than buying them one at a time at your local pet store. Save, Save, Save! Only complaint I have is it would be nice if they had a beef flavor added. Ever the less, my Lab chews on these rawhide bones alot."
positive,11/6/21,"This product is good for any dish, I like to just cut it out and eat like snack but remember to go with nice wine or else it will be taste funny in your mouth.  It also good for cooking with lettuce, boil or pan fried the lettuce first then add on this product and make a oyster sauce topping, it will be delicious."
positive,25/6/21,I have used this product many rimes and it is the Best tasting product for cole slaw.  I am now having a hard time finding it again but I asked Walmart if they are going to sell it again and told me to check after Feb.  I have used it for parties and my guest think that is really great and I never have any left overs.  Thanks for a great tasting slaw mix.
positive,2/8/21,"I've been a NuGo bar fan for years.  This special flavor is my new favorite.  It's a great blend between banana and chocolate.  Great texture and taste.  And I love that this has such a high amount of protein compared to the other bars."
positive,11/6/21,"Growing up with this tasty treat, I was really excited when I found it on Amazon. Great little calorie overload with your afternoon tea or late night milk/cookie snack. I have no clue how many calores one of  wafers will ""provide"" and I don't care. I love it, I treat myself to it  from time to time without guilt. Life is to short to bother with calories. Wafers are packed with flavor, crispy and tasty. Rum is fake, just for flavor, no alcohol in it. Enjoy it and then work out next day a bit harder. I do!"
positive,9/7/21,Calorie count is good. The orange smoothie is the best.<br /><br />These bars used to be sold by costco. They are much moister than other bars.
positive,22/6/21,"This ended up being exactly what I was looking for!  I purchased a slew of nostalgic candy for my 30th birthday party.  When I came across Fun Dip, the only ones I could find anywhere were the individually packaged flavor packs.  Amazon actually had the big packs (that I grew up with) with the two sugar sticks and three different flavored sugar packs.  If that's what you're looking for, this is your product!<br /><br />(On a side note, the candies were a big hit!)"
positive,2/8/21,Not much you can say about coconut syrup other than it tastes good. Item arrived in a timely manner and have no complaints at all to make.
positive,11/6/21,"I was expecting this chocolate to not taste good because it's healthy and is made with stevia.  I am on the maintenance phase of the hcg diet, so cannot have any sugar at all.  I LOVE this chocolate and am getting ready to place another order for it.  I had to request the nutrition information because none came with it.  Here it is for anyone that wants it:<br />Serving size:  1 bar (45g)<br />Calories:  260<br />Calories from fat:  210<br />Total fat:  24g<br />Saturated fat: 14g<br />Trans fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol 0mg<br />Sodium: 0mg<br />Total carbohydrate:  12g<br />Dietary fiber:  7g<br />Sugars:  0g<br />Protein 7g<br /><br />I eat about half a bar a day after lunch and it really hits the spot!  Good for anyone on a sugar-free or low carb diet."
negative,8/7/21,"I got this product because I was on the HCG diet and wanted a special treat for Valentine's Day. I was really hoping it would be good, but it wasn't.<br />This chocolate can be used in cooking I suppose, if you add some additional sweetener to it. It did not relieve my craving for chocolate. It is very bitter tasting. When I tasted a tiny bite, it was just a little bitter. The bar is divided up into blocks. When I put a block in my mouth, it was awful and I ended up spitting it out. It made me think of taking a spoonful of bitter cocoa and trying to eat it.<br />Also, you have to order such a large amount that it is a huge waste if you don't like it. They should sell individual bars so people can know if they like it before buying such a large quantity."
positive,28/9/21,"The taste is good and not too hot.  My only problem is the sodium in 1 tsp is 260mg or 11% of the daily allowance.  A sodium-free product would be much better IMHO.  This product is really salty on the palate.<br /><br />If you mix it with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005ZVOR8"">Pomi Chopped Tomatoes, 26.46 Ounce Tetra Pack (Pack of 12)</a> and garlic, you get a good Arrabiata sauce.<br /><br />This is about half as hot as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018P4EK8"">Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce Huy Fong 17 Oz.</a>"
positive,23/8/21,"After a Bariatric Surgery, I can't take pills whole. I must crush them and mix them with the sugar-free apple sauce. As you can imagine, it's so bitter that you just want to die. However, if you add this FANTASTIC product, you won't taste the bitterness of the medications. And it's sugar free! It doesn't taste sugar free. It tastes just wonderful.<br /><br />I tried mixing my own xylitol (sugar alcohol) with cinnamon - it doesn't come out that well. But this product - it is JUST GREAT! There is no aftertaste whatsoever!<br /><br />I highly recommend it."
positive,1/8/21,"The smoked tuna is our favorite, but the sweet n sour is good too. It's healthy and so easy to fix a quick snack or use for a meal. DELICIOUS..."
positive,16/7/21,I got a Cuisinart single cup brewing system for Christmas and it came with 3 different K-Cups. Newmans Own is my favorite of the 3 by far. I would buy this coffee again! Nice and bold and rich!
positive,2/8/21,"I ordered this cereal from Amazon's: Subscribe and Save. The Buckwheat cereal arrived within four days, arriving fresh. Super taste, with all natural organic ingredients.<br /><br />I'll continue with the Subscribe and Save to be certain I have a monthly supply coming."
positive,11/6/21,"I don't know if it gives me any more energy but it has a surprisingly natural flavor with very little (if any) after taste for a no calorie beverage.  You can really taste the blueberry."
positive,26/6/21,"I love the taste of this hemp protein Powder.  I love to mush up bananas with a fork, add some dried figs with raisins and pour this hemp protein all over it with the Nutiva Hemp seeds.  It tastes great and satisfies me on every level.<br /><br />I also sensed there was much more fiber in the powder compared to other brands.  I couldn't believe when I saw that there was 14 grams per serving.  Considering that 90% of Americans are lacking in fiber, this Protein Powder can be a great service to millions."
positive,20/8/21,"Great nutty flavor and delightful texture, but what puts it over the top is the great price with the Amazon ""Subscribe and Save"" program. Buy it."
positive,25/8/21,This gum is wonderful.  A little expensive and cost prohibative for people that chew alot of gum. No after taste.  I hope they bring the price down and come up with more flavors.
positive,19/10/21,"I use this on a lot of foods - it has a hint of hotness in large amounts, but nothing overpowering.  My favorite use right now is to top off chicken breasts prior to grilling - amazing how great they taste, and my friends have had nothing but good things to say about it."
positive,2/8/21,"This is my favorite snack.  I love its mild spicy taste.  It tastes great, specially when there is no salsa available!"
positive,11/6/21,"I had my doubts about these chips until I got my first case. I always loved and considered, ranch, & sour cream & onion pringle potato chips as the best until I open my first bag of these. Let me tell you, no chip is better than these are; I got excellent taste buds to prove it. Therefore, if these chips are extremely good to me , then I know they will be tasty to other people. Try a bag and you will see, trust me."
positive,22/10/21,"I didn't know what to expect since I have never used a pre-cooked cornmeal before, but I made delicious polenta with it! The polenta was creamy and smooth and delicious, with a very mild nutty corn flavor,and the next day it had hardened and I slices it and fried it in a little butter and it was delicious!  My first go at arepas was not so successful, but I think that I am to blame, and not the product!My only complaint is that it is hard to find recipes that use it."
positive,6/8/21,"If any of you read Kim Harrison - you will know that Al always orders a latte with raspberry syrup and extra cinnamon.  I tried this drink at Starbucks and it was wonderful.  I have an espresso machine at home and thought I could save a lot of time and money making this drink on my own.  This syrup was perfect!  It tastes wonderful, both in my coffee and also on ice cream!"
positive,24/6/21,The stores around here do not carry this product.  My husband is diabetic and Swiss Miss No Sugar is perfect for us.  We use it with coffee to make our own cafe mochas.
positive,17/4/21,"This makes some great baked goods! I'm no baking expert but I can follow a recipe pretty well. So far I've used it in chocolate chip cookies and waffles. I think people are right and saying that you should scale down the amount of vanilla needed. I've been using exactly what was on the recipe and I get just a slight alcohol aftertaste. If you smell the vanilla right out of the bottle, it is clear it's the vanilla you are tasting. It's not unpleasant and I don't think anybody would really notice."
positive,10/3/21,"My daughter tells me these are the best tasting message hearts.  I ordered these after Valentine's Day just because she likes them so much."
positive,17/4/21,"Open the lid on this lovely salt and you are struck with the unmistakable aroma of truffles. The taste is even better. A little goes a long way. I add a pinch to eggs to turn ordinary into decadent. Like another review, I also love this salt in popcorn. I add a pinch to my oil (usually clarified butter) before popping and supplement with plain sea salt ground fine in the mortar and pestle. A nice change of pace.<br /><br />This salt is speckled with black truffle flakes that look something like ground black pepper. The truffle flavor is infused throughout. The salt I received on 5/31/2010 has a 'best before' date of 10/28/2012."
negative,21/1/21,"I have tried a few brands of truffle salt.  I like it on popcorn.  I thought that this product would be great since it was 10% truffle instead of the 5% I had been purchasing.  Although the aroma of this product is good, the taste is just bad--not awful, bad.  The bitter flavor is at the front, not an aftertaste and there is not a strong truffle flavor.  I am very disappointed."
positive,30/1/21,"I remembered this from when I was a kid. I hoped it was as good as I remembered. It was!! This is great. If you like honey and cinnamon you can't miss."
positive,13/2/21,"This is literally the best cereal in my entire life that I have ever eaten. It's a perfect supplement to a whole foods vegan diet. at 16g of protein per cup, packed with fiber, minerals, and vitamins, you cannot go wrong with this cereal. This texture and taste are not for everyone, but for those who like hearty, multi grain, sugar free types of food, this is the cereal for you!"
positive,15/1/21,"dear amazon.com<br />Please keep this on subscribe and save forever.<br />this is a great cereal for health.<br />not the best tasting in the world but this is a powerhouse of nutrition, at a great price with subscribe and save!<br />thanks amazon,<br />sincerly loyal customer forever.<br />P.S. will be purchasing more."
positive,6/3/21,"I really love black licorice, but I could no longer eat it because of the items used in the manufacture of licorice that usually shows up in the stores.  This is very authentic and gluten free.  It does come in very large chunks, which I cut into smaller pieces because I was chowing down way too much of this great candy at one time!  It is a tasty licorice."
positive,8/6/21,"Tried this flavor first time in France this summer (2012) and loved the refreshing taste of it! The blue and red ones are also very nice, but my fav was the silver one. Too bad it's hard to find elsewhere"
positive,7/1/21,"This jerky is the soft, chewy style.  Though it is listed as Sweet'N'Spicy, it's quite a bit more sweet than spicy.  I doubt even the most sensitive to spice would consider this spicy jerky.  It's tasty, it doesn't have any nitrites, MSG, high fructose corn syrup or anything else that's terrible for you.  It's also affordable.  The only reason it didn't get five stars is that it's not an outstanding and amazing, one-of-a-kind flavor worthy of five stars."
positive,17/4/21,"Our family is fairly new to gluten free. We've eaten the original Golden Malted and find that the gluten free version is similar. We like it and are ordering our second batch of 3 cannisters. It's a quick easy alternative to making homemade."
positive,10/3/21,"Received this on time, in fact, early. I was looking for an energy booster during the day at work. These chocolates were great tasting and did give me the boost I was looking for. I'll purchase them again."
positive,14/1/21,"Purchased this elsewhere for more money- won't do that again! Mainly use it for Gluten-free cookies, etc.  Love it!<br />Susie C."
positive,24/5/21,"I had these crackers in a snack box on a recent Delta flight and enjoyed them so much I searched the internet to see where I could purchase them locally.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find a store in my area that sold them.  The taste is so good you can eat them just as a snack or serve with dips or spreads.  I ordered the Roasted Garlic with Rosemay and also the onion flavored version (which I haven't tried, yet).  Although some reviewers said their Wisecrackers showed up in bits and pieces, mine were in perfect shape."
positive,14/10/21,"There was a huge internet blow up over these candy corn Oreos. I love candy corn so I had to try them. I have only two Targets in my area and both were sold out. Luckily, Amazon has them available.<br /><br />They have a slight taste of candy corn but not overwhelming. On the sweet side. Interesting. I really like the vanilla cookie taste, so I enjoyed them. My husband thought they were a bit too sweet for his tastes. More for me!"
positive,7/2/21,"My first meal replacement was Slim Fast, unfortunatly it didn't work for me. Before I decided to try this product, I did some research. This is a good protein shake. It has 180 calories and 30g of protein! Low sugar compare to other drinks. I drink it once/day after a 1 hour workout for five days a week. The chocolate tastes great. No need to add the extras like ice, juices, or fruits for better taste. Instantly stopped my hunger for a couple of hours. Gives me a good amount of energy. Not gassy! The packets are great for traveling.<br />UPDATE - 3/10/11<br />So far, chocolate it the best flavor. Vanilla tastes like lite sweet milk. Haven't tried strawberry yet."
positive,29/3/21,"This is a great meal replacement. I even throw in to the blender 1/2 fluids that are apple juice and water, 1/2 banana and a strawberry. Yummy and filling. I do not run out of steam on the tennis courts anymore."
positive,17/4/21,"I have always loved ceylon black tea but this was the first time I tried green.  Again this is my very favorite.  It is very mild and does not have the ""grassy"" taste of other green teas.  I highly recommend it.  Ceylon and Amazon do it again!"
positive,10/3/21,"I enjoy Indian food but unfortunately the closest Indian restaurant is 150 miles away from my house. I've tried other commercial Indian food products and have not been very pleased. The Kitchens of India Butter Chicken Curry, however, is tasty, just spicy enough for me (well, maybe a little on the mild side), and easy to make. I buy the Costco rotisserie chicken, debone it, put it in 1 pound zip-lock bags, and freeze them. Each envelope of the Butter Curry needs 1 pound of chicken, so I just pop the chicken out of the freezer, defrost it, add the curry paste and butter, and in about 20 minutes I have a delicious dinner. I will definitely be ordering this product again."
positive,10/7/21,"Both my daughter and I found this very tasty, and it""s so easy to make.  Tastes authentic, highly recommended!"
positive,27/1/21,"This was a very easy curry paste to use and it came out very close to what you get at restaurants.  All I added was butter, chicken and water.  I made 3 servings with one packet of paste but I think if I had more chicken, I could have made 4 servings."
positive,1/6/21,"These cookies are tasty.  At times they're a normal part of my daily diet.  I've eaten a bag for breakfast on multiple occasions.  Also try Trader Joe's vegan trail mix cookies for an alternative.  I can't decide which ones I like better.  TJ's are chewier.  Both rank as my favorite cookies."
positive,20/8/21,"Delicious, only it is not enough for one serving, rice are very tasty but gravy is not that great tast and also too much for the rice. If they can pack more rice and less gravy that will be very fine."
positive,14/8/21,"I've already reordered this item twice. I like the taste of it. It has the right amount of spice and can be used to make veg briyani if your not very fond of chicken(I tried both). One of the best products from KoI. Recommended"
positive,21/4/21,"Exceptional coffee all around - rich, full, with subtle hints of dark chocolate. My coffee-snob neighbor just ordered 4 pounds herself after having just one cup!"
positive,1/4/21,This is the best tasting and best price on a stevia product that I have found.
positive,17/4/21,"I enjoy the flavor and benefits of fresh wheat grass but it is difficult to keep on hand. This powder seems to offer the same ""punch"" as well as tasting good. I'm very pleased with the product and now rely solely on it."
positive,10/3/21,I have tried a few other wheat grass powders and had a hard time drinking them. This was very mild. I can drink it just mixed with water. My 2 year old and 4 year old liked it and wanted more. I love all of the Amazing Grass products. They all taste great and are a great company to order from.
positive,22/4/21,This tastes great although I do add a little more cinnamon. It does not fill you up like homeade oatmeal does but it is still a nice product.
positive,25/4/21,"Savory Choice is the best stock I've found and I love everything about it.  First off, it's flavor is incomparable to any other pre-made stock product and it really tastes like what chicken stock is supposed to taste like. I shared it with my grandmother and it won even *her* stamp of approval.  Secondly, I love that it is concentrated so that you make up just the amount you need, which is especially handy when you are deglazing a pan to make a sauce, for example; you don't end up with a whole quart container going bad in your fridge.  Finally, if there's anything I learned from NY apt. living, I love how small the footprint is of the box, itself.  It's also great to pack for backpacking trips, to keep in your desk at work, etc.<br /><br />They make chicken, beef, and turkey and around the Bay Area, it's available at Whole Foods, Berkeley Bowl, Andronico's, etc."
positive,1/4/21,"I love coffee, and this product was a nice mid-afternoon pick me up. It was refreshingly cold on a hot day and gave me that burst of caffeine energy that keeps me going.<br /><br />I enjoyed the taste very much. I like my hot morning coffee with lots of milk and a bit of sugar, and this was similar to how I make it. People who like their coffee black or with milk/cream and no sugar will probably not like this product.<br /><br />Overall, I was very pleased with it, though I doubt I'd buy it often at approximately two bucks a can."
positive,30/6/21,"I drink a couple of cups of strong black coffee every day but rarely a fancy drink from a cafe.<br /><br />This product is convenient- you can just put it in the refrigerator or open the can and pour it over ice - or both.<br />The taste is smooth and well balanced.<br />It has plenty of caffeine and the right amount of milk and sugar.<br /><br />I have had a very similar product from Starbucks and I really don't sense much of a difference between the two. I would probably buy whatever is a better value at the time. Again, this product and the product from Starbucks seem to taste the same to me and are of the same high quality."
positive,1/3/21,"This little can packs a good punch!  Lots of flavor and a caffeine boost.  Apparently, all for just 100 calories (according to the can).  The flavor is very rich but not so rich that you can't finish it.  I drank it right from the can, as I probably normally would and did notice a bit of a tin after taste from the can.  I poured the rest into a glass over some ice and it was excellent.  So if this is going to be your ""on the road"" solution, you might think again.  But, if you can enjoy it in a glass -- you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Good stuff!"
positive,29/1/21,I have had the illy issimo coffee before and liked it so I was excited to try this iced coffee drink. This cappuccino has a nice smooth taste with just enough sugar to make it sweet (but not overwhelming). It gave me a nice jolt of energy to get me through the afternoon but not leave me jittery. I will buy this again!
positive,17/4/21,"This is a nice little coffee drink - not too sweet, only 100 calories and as good as Starbucks Lo Fat drinks.  Would have preferred a glass container but the little cans fit really well in my handbag."
positive,10/3/21,"This illy issimo ""italian espresso style coffee drink with lowfat milk and cocoa"" is quite delicious. The cocoa taste is subtle and it is not too sweet. The smooth taste beats out other similar prepackaged drinks I've tried.<br /><br />Each 200ml / 8.45 oz. can is only 100 calories, 1.5g fat and 4g of protein, so it feels like a decent choice nutritionally. It contains 81mg of caffeine, if you are counting.<br /><br />illy roasts good coffee and even masked by the sugar and milk, you can tell this 100% Arabica coffee is the good stuff. It is very smooth, no bitter / burnt taste like some coffee roasters are prone to. These drinks are made in Denmark and distributed by Coca Cola in the US, which piqued my interest. I'd recommend these to people who like to have some cold coffee drinks on hand for busy mornings or a quick pick me up."
positive,30/5/21,"This is the first cold coffee drink (without crushed ice, like a Frappuccino at Starbucks) I have ever had.  I do enjoy coffee, but during the Summer I often turn to soft drinks instead (I usually do not want a hot drink when it is 100 degrees outside).  I was not sure what to expect from this, but was surprised that it was quite delicious and refreshing!  Being a Cappuccino, it has low fat milk (which is nice, since most places just use whole milk), and a hint of cocoa (not too much where you cannot taste the coffee, but there is a hint that makes it perfect)!  Because of the low fat milk and cocoa this beverage has 100 calories, 1.5g of Fat (1g Sat Fat), 19g of Carbs, and 18g of Sugar (from label).  That is not too bad considering what some coffee beverages have.  The coffee is very strong and has a great taste, it is not bitter and drinks very smoothly.<br /><br />When I got this item, I placed it in the fridge and it was in there fore a few days (so it was nice and cold), and it was very refreshing and smooth, the coffee was the primary taste in the drink, and the milk and cocoa were secondary, so you got a nice taste of what tasted like high quality coffee with a smooth finish from the milk and cocoa.  I am very pleased with this drink and found it quite refreshing and a nice change from a standard cup of coffee (especially during these hot days), and with only 100 calories it is a great start to the day!  Highly recommend!!!"
positive,28/9/21,"No complaints whatsoever. This is a tasty coffee drink. The coffee is strong and good and the sweetener is perfect - just sweet enough without being that kind of sickly sweet that mars something like Starbucks' pre-made iced coffee drinks. Just about perfect. Refreshing and a nice boost for the afternoon."
positive,6/5/21,"If you are already a fan of illy coffee in general (whole bean, ground, espresso), most likely you'll enjoy this can of Cappucino Coffee.<br /><br />The flavor of this drink is heavy on coffee with light milk (lowfat) added. The bitterness of the coffee is only lightly offset by the milk, so hopefully if you decide on this drink, it will be for a coffee flavor and not a more milky coffee flavor. There is also a hint of sweetness though I did notice that the sweetness seems to be closer to the bottom of the can. The can indicates that it shouldn't be shaken, so maybe this is expected?<br /><br />There are 100 calories per can and gave me a decent caffeine jolt.<br /><br />The can indicates this is a product of Denmark and is distributed by the Coca Cola company. The weird part here is that illy is an Italian brand... guess it costs too much to import from Italy? No idea there.<br /><br />I only received one can as part of the Vine program, but have purchased single serve cans of this on my own and will, without doubt, purchase further cans of it."
positive,20/4/21,This is one of my absolute favorites. Would recommend to anyone. I have even gotten coworkers hooked on it because it is so good.
positive,20/4/21,"I tried this product on a whim, hoping that it would be good.<br />To my surprise, it was very good. I was pleased that the<br />ingredients did not include trans fat or high fructose corn<br />syrup. For a convenience item, I give it high marks. It tastes<br />great and is extremely easy to prepare."
negative,21/4/21,"After reading the reviews I decided to order a bag and try it. I had had numerous styles of Kona coffee over the years and love the smell and flavor. When it arrived I ground some up and brewed up a pot. The smell was there but the flavor was lacking. It was missing that Kona pop that I have experienced in the past with other coffee's. Over the next few weeks I tried different brewing combinations. No matter what I tried, it was quite bland and just did not have any flavor. I was quite disappointed by the coffee."
positive,2/5/21,"We got them to add to Special K Red Berry cereal because sometime the end of the bag as fewer than the start.  But now we eat them by the hand full and add them to everything. My Daughter grabs the bag over other snack food, which makes me smile !"
negative,18/12/19,"I'm not sure how or why this soup mix is getting such good reviews. It has no flavor whatsoever. When they dehydrated the ingredients they pulled all the flavor out. I've tried everything to make a decent dish with this stuff, but always turns out bland and tasteless.<br /><br />The recommend mix is also WAY off (4 cups water / mix)...you'll end up with a lintel sludge that is nothing like soup. I think I could probably calk my bathroom with it or make a nice adobe hut however.<br /><br />If you are into very bland food this will probably be good. If you like flavor stay away."
positive,19/1/20,"One of the only apple drink mixes I found that tastes good. I used to buy the Walmart brand apple drink, but that tasted too fake for my taste. This one contains some sugar so it has some calories, but taste wise it's like light apple juice with a hint of artificial flavoring."
positive,19/1/20,"These are Wheat-free, gluten-free, non-dairy granola bars.<br /><br />They taste pretty good. They're not listed as organic, but it seems like they should make them that way since they're free of so many other things. Some of the ingredients are listed as organic, but not all.<br /><br />They taste good. There are 9grams of sugar per each bar just FYI.<br /><br />For anyone wondering about the ingredients for allergies or food sensitivities, here they are in order:<br /><br />- Gluten-Free Oats<br />- Organic Agave<br />- Rice Blend (Brown Rice Flour, White Rice Flour, Tapioca Starch, Sweet Rice Flour, Xanthan Gum)<br />- Coconut Sugar<br />- Raisins<br />- Monounsaturated Safflower Oil<br />- Organic Eggs<br />- Walnuts<br />- Coconut<br />- Chia Seeds<br />- Natural Vanilla Flavor,<br />- Sices<br />- Baking Soda<br />- Sea Salt<br />- Xanthan Gum<br />- Grainless & Aluminum Free Baking Powder (Sodium Bicarbonate, Sodium Acid Pyrophosphate, Potato Starch)"
positive,31/3/20,"These bars are a tasty snack.  The taste is like a dry carrot cake.  It is a little chewy, and has a nice texture, with nuts and raisins.  It is surprisingly high in calories, 180 for each bar."
positive,18/12/19,"Pamela's oat raisin walnut spice bars are moist and tasty. Although the ingredients are top notch, they gave me heartburn."
positive,13/10/19,"The hotlix scorpion sucker is a pretty tasty, pretty wild and a pretty fun treat for any occasion.  I used it for a presentation in by biology class and it was received  very well by the teacher and my fellow students."
positive,28/9/20,"Eat it by the handful, mix with baking  or other food, or mix with bee pollen for ultimate nutrition."
positive,16/11/20,Not much to say. I grew up on this stuff and it is very good.
positive,27/2/20,"Bought this in spite of the high price and unreasonble S&H, just to match what I make at home. I mix it with fresh ground hemp seed. I buy the almonds (in the shell) at [...], soak the nuts and grind them in my VitaMix... Beats peanut butter to hell and back."
positive,26/2/21,"I like it!  It's got the same after taste as the granulated, if you're wondering.  I find it pleasant.  Used it in coffee today and it was the perfect sweetness (and actually once it was in coffee, to me it was the same flavor as sugar - with no aftertaste). I don't like splenda very much and can't stand sweet n low. Been using stevia for a few months and got this to stir into yogurt. Excited!<br /><br />Didn't realize it had to be refrigerated, but that was just my own ignorance.<br /><br />Was hesitant, but now I highly recommend the SweetLeaf stevia clear!"
positive,18/12/19,"Adds flavor to all sorts of dishes.  Great for deviled eggs, mix with the yoke filler and top it off with a slice of jalepeno."
positive,19/1/20,I have always wanted a Tea I could drink at night that would not wake me up at 3 in the morning.  I have always liked Black Currant. So this was a win win for me.  The tea is delicious.
positive,13/9/20,"I now have to lower soduim intake and this does the trick!  It tastes great and you do not miss the salt.  I usually eat with reduced fat or sodium cheese and enjoy every bite!  Even the family is liking it, the variety does proove difficult to find though.  Wish Amazon carried it regularly."
positive,10/7/20,"I do not eat them myself. I bought them for my husband because he is Greek and loves Greek food. he loves them very much so. They last him for 2 meals.<br />  Thank you very much,<br /> Happy4greenbay"
positive,14/4/21,"We've had this spice blend since picking it up at a Whole Foods in Portland after tasting a sample.  Company was coming over and we needed something easy that could be prepped ahead.  Enter the Moroccan Spice Blend, and it received rave reviews.  We used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and marinated them for about a day and a half.  When it came time to cook, we just dumped them into a 9x13 dish and baked as directed for an hour.  Serving it with couscous, Moroccan carrot salad, and coconut cupcakes, we spent the rest of the evening thoroughly stuffed.  Absolutely delicious!  Sweet and savory, the blend had just the right amount of kick without setting our mouths on fire.  Fabulous!"
positive,24/4/21,This dip is absolutely delicious.  It is so easy to make.  The price is also exceptional.
positive,28/4/21,"This coffee tastes GREAT.<br /><br />I usually purchase Folger's classic style blend from Sams $11 due to the convenience of the, packaging and expected level of flavor.  One day, I bought a 12oz. package of #4 from Seatle's Best from Wally World (Wal-Mart) for $6.00, having already experienced the goodness from Borders before they went bankrupt, I was happy to see a great price on the product.<br /><br />I absolutely have fallen in love with this coffee!  A cup of this, and ""Coldstone Sweet cream"" Creamer is great.  Simply put, I prefer to have my day start with that combination and I'm saddened whilst I am at work and my cup finally runs empty.<br /><br />However, the $31 price on 3 bags seems a bit high, as a 2-pack of 12oz goes for $15.00 on here as well.  Huge markup on the 3-pack, which makes no sense."
positive,12/7/21,We put this in everything!! It gives an extra kick to everything from sandwiches to egg salad to . . .
positive,18/12/19,"Great product.  Received it in a timely manner.  If you like tea, this is a keeper."
negative,19/1/20,"I really love herbal tea, especially orange and mandarin. But all of Teekanne's teas were tasteless and even if you put two packages in a cup of tea you still get no taste. Now I have three packages of Teakanne (2 relaxing and 1 energizing) and I don't know what to do with it. Surely will not drink it."
positive,28/4/21,"This really does taste a lot (not exactly) like regular bubble gum. It's thick, chunky, and kid's can make huge pink bubbles with it, and it lasts and lasts. As a treat you don't have to worry about for a child, or as a diet item for an adult, this is great."
positive,8/8/20,"I tried McCormick Smoked Paprika a few months ago and was enchanted with this new flavor.  I started delving into Indian cuisine and the ingredients listed Smoked Paprika.  I found this spice at the local Foodlion store and it was quite expensive for a 1.6oz. bottle.  I'm glad to see this larger size at such a good price.  I like the taste of McCormick, so I hesitate to try another brand.  Highly recommended!"
positive,22/5/21,This was an excellent purchase. The product itself was a perfect blend making it smooth and easy to drink. The service of the seller was great and very fast. I would recommend this seller without hesitation.
positive,18/12/19,"I tried these out last weekend just as the temps have started to dip and I was not disappointed! I expected a very fake and chemical tasting brew but was pleasantly surprised that I got neither! I was very happy to ready that there are no artificial ingredients in this one too! This is a great alternative for when you want something different from coffee and tea. If I had to point out anything bad about them, maybe that the flavor is almost too sweet? If you brew it on your smallest cup setting (mine is 5oz for the Keurig B60 Special Edition) it is a tad tooo strong but in the medium size offerning its just right.  I hate having to buy 2-packs though..."
positive,19/1/20,"We love hot apple cider and this was no exception! My 9 year old drank 6 cups the very first day I got this.  It has a wonderful, fresh apple taste with just the right amount of spice.  We will be ordering this on a regular basis!"
positive,3/8/20,"I have been looking everywhere for apple cider k cups.  Decided to check out amazon, and low and behold here they are.  They taste great, but as someone else mentioned they are a bit pricey."
positive,29/7/21,This apple cider is very flavorable and really hits the spot. I am very happy with this purchase and plan on buying this product again.
positive,8/7/20,This product is a nice alternative to pasta or potatoes.  Its very tasty and extremely easy to heat.  The fact that is already precooked makes it even more enjoyable for me.
positive,13/4/21,The best product yet for Tassimo.  I only wish it made a larger cup of coffee.
positive,20/2/21,"I purchased these from Whole Foods for my friend as a gift.  She has Celiac's (sp) and always talks about how crappy gluten free treats are.  I gave her a box and she LOVED them.  I even ate one and I honestly could not tell the difference between an Oreo and Ktoo.<br /><br />I recommend these cookies and Amazon is cheaper than Whole Foods."
positive,9/12/20,"The coffee taste good.  I thought I was getting the whole been but I got ground instead.  Oh well, I guess I don't have to worry about waking people up in the mornings."
positive,1/4/21,"This item is very tasty. It actually tastes better than bouillon. When I made pilaf using this chicken base it tasted exactly the way it tastes when I use homemade chicken base. Lots of flavors, kosher/halal, 100% natural product with number one ingredient being chicken with natural juices and reasonable price. What else to expect from a jar of chicken base."
negative,25/2/21,This buckwheat is tasteless compared to Russian buckwheat. Only good thing is that it is organic. Will not order again.
positive,18/12/19,Has a better taste them some of the other energy shots out there and works get for energy when I am feeling drained.
positive,19/1/20,"I have been paying $3.50 at gas stations for 5 hour.  Red Rain tastes better, same effect to me and much cheaper.  Went through my first pack and ordered another."
positive,14/10/20,"For years I've enjoyed Swedish pancakes served with lingonberry syrup at The Original Pancake House, and even at a few House of Pancakes (though theirs aren't as good).  I discovered the lingonberry preserves at IKEA, and then found these identical ones on Amazon.  They are absolutely wonderful on toast, waffles, pancakes.<br />The seller packaged them extremely well with lots of air-filled material and each jar separately wrapped in paper.  Great job!"
positive,10/3/21,"This soup is great. Of course its more expensive because it is non gmo and organic. The chicken-like bits are just like the real chicken noodle soup style. Its a great soup, kids will love it too if they already like this style of soup!"
positive,15/8/21,It has only a few calories and is even suitable for my husband with Diabetics II.<br />Very fast to prepare before cooking the meal for the family or friends.<br />Taste is really good and not too sweet as many other desserts.<br />Great in summertime - put it for half an hour in the freezer and serve it as a semifreddo.
positive,27/4/21,One of the best taste coffee so far. No bitter taste like other coffee have. Highly recommend for coffee lovers.
negative,24/1/21,"Was very sad to have to throw awy a whole bag of coffee, there was no taste, beans were small and dry ! Very disapointed in this coffee !"
positive,14/7/20,I drink 32 oz of water while I work out and these add a nice taste to the water and mix up very easy and taste nice.
positive,5/6/21,The candy received in wonderful packaging. There was no broken pieces and not one button off the paper and the freshness was great
positive,9/7/21,"I've been trying to find a gluten-free cereal that tastes good and this is THE BEST so far. Love it. I'm buying them here at Amazon by the big boxes, pack of 6! :)"
positive,5/6/21,"I was so happy to see Amazon carry this product. It is very good, very healthy, and uses minimum packaging."
positive,25/7/21,"Great value, just be sure to have a place where the bag won't be crowded. Or transfer into a hard container and scoop out desired amount when needed.  Corn flakes taste hearty, (you can actually taste the corn), nice thick flakes that don't go limp a minute after being exposed to the milk."
positive,13/7/21,"I bought this on a walmart and then decided to buy it on line. the smokey taste not overpowering the rest of the food makes it perfect. I don't like much spicy food and this has just the right amount of spicyness. the oaky flavor is a plus too."
positive,9/7/21,"I work in food nutrition and we use this for our vegetables and we make vegetable soup.  This base has the best flavor in the world.  I could just drink it up all the time, just add water and you are good to go.  I went on line to see if I could purchase it because I want it for my cooking in my home."
positive,8/7/21,Very fast shipping. I made Hot and Sour soup with these. Re-hydrated these increase in volume almost 4 times. You have to have these to make authentic Hot and Sour soup. They add a nice crunch and have very good health benefits. Will definitely order again.
positive,15/7/21,not much to say here.  it was shipped quickly and arrived in excellent time and condition.  product arrived fresh and tasty.  top quality stuff.
positive,6/7/21,"Pasta Knorr Sauce Parma Rosa Creamy Tomato / B000I2OOPW<br /><br />Pardon me while I rave about how incredible this pasta mix is, but I'm just totally in love with this sauce. I love to eat pasta, but I am usually confined to the higher-fat alfredo sauces and cheese sauces because acidic tomato sauces irritate my acid reflux. That means no spaghetti and meatballs, which has been frustrating for me, but that's life, eh?<br /><br />Then, while I was browsing the sauce aisle for Knorr alfredo packets, I found this Parma Rosa sauce. I have no idea what 'vodka sauce' is that the other reviewers reference, but whatever this is, it is GOOD. If I had to describe it, I'd call it a creamy tomato alfredo, but even though it is creamy, it is also very light and pleasing to taste, not cloying. The tomato taste is exquisite, and the acid content is low enough to prevent stomach pains. The taste itself is absolutely wonderful - I can actually talk myself out of impulse eating by promising myself Parma Rosa later - it's that good!<br /><br />The Knorr sauces are fairly easy to make (the instructions are serious when they say to 'stir constantly', though, and I think it helps to preheat the milk before adding the powdered mix) and they store indefinitely in these dried packets (another reason to buy packets, besides the smaller carbon footprint in shipping versus jars!). Oh, and buying them on Amazon means I get them for half the price of the local market! For the Parma Rosa, I also add about a third of a pound of seasoned, browned ground beef as easy 'meatballs'. The portions are such that I can easily get two full meals out of one sauce packet, and the sauce stores perfectly in the fridge - this coming from a person who generally hates leftovers.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll"
positive,13/8/21,"This is a great product that is very easy to make. It never clumps, which is a great plus when it comes to dry sauce mixes.<br />I personally favor the Knorr white sauces (e.g. the Alfredo or Garlic Herb), which is the only reason why I'm not giving this 5 stars.<br />Overall, it's very enjoyable, nice to have around when you don't want to make sauce from scratch, and I would definitely purchase again."
positive,5/6/21,"I took this stuff on a two week camping trip.  I put it in chilli, made tacos and soups.  This is the best tasting sour cream powder I've ever come across.  Buy this stuff now!  One bag lasted 6 campers for about 3-4 meals used as a condiment."
positive,9/7/21,"Mushrooms can add a lot of flavor to a dish.  Canned mushrooms are bland and boring and fresh mushrooms have a limited shelf life.  Dried mushrooms pack a lot of flavor and have a long shelf life (I believe they are good for up to 2 years).  A one ounce package of dried is the equivalent of a half pound of fresh.  They need to be soaked in warm water for about an hour to hydrate before using.  The water used for hydrating can be used in your dish for added flavor.  It can also be reduced to concentrate the flavor.  Once hydrated, the mushrooms can be used in any application that you would use fresh or canned.<br /><br />The Chanterelles are a mild, less earthy tasting fungus.  They go very well with eggs, chicken and fish.  They are also great in a stir fry.<br /><br />The FungusAmongUs is a high quality brand that I highly recommend."
positive,17/6/21,"We first tried this sauce in Costa Rica on vacation. When we ran out of what we had brought home with us I was so glad to find it on amazon. This bottle is huge and will last quite a while. This sauce is really good, it has a kind of smokey, spicy flavor."
positive,31/8/21,"I heard about sour sop on the internet for being a great cancer fighter. Time will tell if the claim is true but I will say this, it tastes great."
positive,7/8/21,"Great tasting coffee. It was a hit at the office as well as at home! I wil typically mix it at home with a darker roast columbiam type coffee as i like my coffee a little darker, but either way glad i tried it!"
positive,6/9/21,"I despise low-fat/non-fat dressings and would prefer to eat a salad plain rather than use them.  But these Walden Farms Dressings taste great and make a diet less monotonous.  My husband likes them too, and he always prefers the high calorie version of anything."
positive,5/6/21,Very pleased with the quality of this product. A beginner at cake decorating this was very easy to work with and the flavor was great as expressed by all that tasted it. Will be ordering more product from this company.
positive,9/7/21,"I like Nature Valley granola bars because they fill me up better than other brands, such as Special K or the Quaker Oats granola bars. They're also chewy and sweet, great for a snack or a quick breakfast. My only complaint is that it is a little too sweet."
positive,19/6/21,"This is a really good product.  While it is only 4 ounces, it is actually about a quart of freeze dried shallots.  I have long used fresh shallots extensively in cooking, and these are an excellent replacementwhen ""fresh"" is not required (such as salads, etc).  They save all the work of peeling and chopping fresh shallots for cooking.  The product, while fairly costly (as are fresh shallots), is a real time saver, and worth every penny of the cost.  Freeze dried is much better than just plain dried.  I use freeze dried herbs whenever I can find them, as they more exactly replace fresh products.  If you use shallots, you will love this product."
positive,5/9/21,"These bars are quite tasty and a little crumbly. If you factor in the weight to calorie ratio, they are about the same,(ratio wise),to Nature Valley bars. The Amazon or Quaker description says 5.5 ozs. However each bar is only 0.91 ozs. The whole package of 6 weigh 5.5 oz. But I did give them 4 stars on taste because of my particular fondness for anything blueberry. One would have to check pricing per ounce with other brands for the value conscious."
positive,10/10/21,"Great simple snacks for those who are watching calories. At 100 calories a bar, these have an amazing blueberry flavor and all natural texture. There is no doubt that these will get you through your hunger to your next meal without packing on the pounds. These bars are a step up in the granola/breakfast/snack bar catagory. Highly reccomended!"
positive,29/9/21,"Originally I hated this cereal becaused it tasted so bland and powdery when hot or cold.  However, after eating it three times, I have strangely learned to love it and now I've been eating it for one month.<br /><br />So this was an acquired taste for me that I will definitely order again when I get tired of my steel cut oatmeal.  If you are not use to eating healthy foods, however, you might dislike this cereal and never acquire a taste for it."
positive,11/9/21,"This Flaxseed meal is the best EVER!<br /><br />I've tried several brands that I purchased in local markets but it's not that easy to find whole ground flaxseed around where I live. So the ones I was able to find had a sand-like texture (and taste), my wife couldn't stand it despite of the known benefits of taking it.<br /><br />This flaxseed texture is awesome for her and she's enjoying it!<br />She mixes with milk in the morning and smoothie in the afternoon and doesn't complain anymore about the taste.<br /><br />I take it before the meals with juice and I think it has a wonderful nutty taste.<br /><br />I had initially setup the subscription for every 6 months, but we liked it so much, we are changing it for every 3 months!"
positive,5/6/21,I love this product. Delivered on time and taste great. I use a lot of butter in my cooking and this large size is perfect. All the tasted without the bad stuff.
positive,9/7/21,"These biscuits are really good! I bring them to school as a snack after practice or before lunch. I think they are a lot better than Nutri grain bars and Quaker Oats granola bars. I've also tried the apple flavored onesbut the blueberry ones definetely taste better. It's also really easy to find coupons for them on the internet: [...]/ or just Google Belvita coupons!"
positive,26/8/21,"this wasn't quite what I expected - the last time I ordered a similar treat, it was thinner crispy banana slices - these are thicker bananas.  my dog loves them, but there is so much banana that I can't give her more than one or two a week - too rich - they give her the runs.  but she loves them!"
positive,26/7/21,This tastes great.  I have shared it with several people and they love it.
positive,11/9/21,I have enjoyed using the maple flavor. It adds flavor to my diet that I would not have without it.
positive,11/9/21,"How much is there really to say about salt?  The size of the ground crystals will depend on your grinder - I find fine to be good for some foods (like eggs) and prefer a coarser grind for other foods (potatos).  The Sea Salt has a more complex flavor than regular, ""plain"" table salt.<br /><br />For me, the flavor of the Sea Salt is much prefered over normal salt."
positive,15/9/21,"This Hafi Lingonberry preserves not only arrived in a timely fashion, but also adds favorably to our morning and afternoon snack experiences.  Not too sweet, not too tart.  My husband adds it to the very healthy shake he makes for the two of us each morning.  I also occasionally like to get my healthy bit of snack in by dipping a few toasted pita chips in the early afternoon when I get most hungry.  Just one or two chips with a total of about one teaspoon of preserves will do it for me for a healthy snack that will not spoil my dinner.  Very happy with the product."
positive,5/6/21,"I love oatcakes so of course like most I did the topping go around and I thought try something way different...hear me out it's not bad, marmite on oatcake lol Try it sometime, Nairns oatcake is great with anything on it or nothing just depends on the person."
positive,9/7/21,"I bought a box of these as a special.  Sure glad I bought when I did as the price went up drastically.  I love raspberries and wanted to try dark chocolate over milk chocolate.  These taste excellent!  I consider them a treat after dinner as if I was eating one of those very expensive chocolates but for much less the cost.  They are small enough that I don't feel like I am packing away pounds by eating one or two yet are very flavorful in a small candy.<br /><br />I would buy again but having 430 of them I have enough for awhile.  Will probably take some to work to share with the group."
positive,14/9/21,"Nowadays, it's really difficult to get a really natural Pineapple fruit, specially where I live, but this product is just fantastic! You can feel the smell and the flavor of a natural pineapple.<br />Thank you!"
positive,29/9/21,"FOR A NON-ORGANIC OR NON-GOURMET ITEM THIS TASTES AMAZINGLY FRESH, CRUNCHY AND YUMMY. BEWARE: CALORIE COUNT, FAT AND SALT CONTENT IS CONSIDERABLE.<br />BUT ONE BAG UPON OCCASION SHOULD NOT EXPLODE YOUR CHOLESTEROL COUNT.<br />crunch! fresh! yum! salty!!!! and a good deal -- free with some other stuff I bought."
positive,10/7/21,I love the flavor. I lived in NY and found this tea with a great taste that I liked but when I moved to GA I could not find it anywhere.Other teas are ok but I really enjoy the taste of Bromley tea. I visit NY twice a year so I would buy it there and bring it to GA( a 6 month supply). I love the flavor so much that even my friends would watch for a sale to buy it for me and mail it. I am so glad that I found it at Amazon so I can order it myself and always have a supply on hand.
positive,1/3/20,I bought this for my 6yo sound to take to school for his birthday. He is really into space and since he is in kindergarten I wanted his first birthday treat at school to be super special. Everyone loved it and he had a really fun experience.
positive,28/7/20,"I have never used vanilla bean paste so I wasn't sure what to expect.  This was an excellent purchase! I have made some very delicious cupcakes and am very glad I have this in my baking pantry for future use!"
positive,28/7/20,"Slow As Molasses, Light and Mild, 11-Ounce Containers (Pack of 6)by Slow As is a great product . I love the taste and smell of this Molasses."
positive,10/11/19,I bought this to make a sauce and it taste great gives a good flavor.  I really enjoyed it an it lasts a long time.
positive,1/3/20,"This is my favorite tea, but I was having trouble finding it in stores. When I looked here they had 40% off and free shipping so I stocked up."
positive,3/8/19,"Never tried Twinings until this purchase.  Happily satisfied. The berry taste is great! I add a little sweetener and, for me, it's that much more yummy.  I'm starting to drink more tea, and this was a smart buy for me."
positive,6/2/21,I love the taste of this milk chocolate. It has the perfect amount of sweetness for me and a very nice smell of the cacao.
positive,24/2/21,I love this green tea. It has a wonderful brown rice flavor that makes it very tasty. I highly recommend it.
positive,13/5/21,"I'd never heard of these before, but I found a bag at my local liquidation store and decided to give 'em a try. They are among the best plain potato chips I've ever tasted. They have the perfect amount of salt, the perfect amount of curl and the perfect amount of crunch. They really do live up to their own hype."
positive,1/3/20,Bought them for myself..eldest daughter fell in love :) enjoys them SO much. Spicey but only a touch..second eldest daughter enjoys them so much i share a bag of them often
positive,28/7/20,"it is very easy to make and taste great. only take less than an hour to make.<br />i made it bread not muffin and used milk instead water , add 3 eggs not 2 !:)"
positive,13/5/20,This gum is quite good. I always chew gum in the gym and this will stay soft through a long workout and run.
positive,26/3/21,"This product is just as expected.  I'm new to making my own sushi so I have no experience prior to buying this product. I've made many Spicy Tuna Rolls and the nori has yet to break on me.  I'm not sure if it's because I have practically mastered the art of sushi (not really) or just gotten lucky and not rolled the sushi too tightly.<br /><br />Either way this was a great buy, shipping didn't take long at all.  Had the nori by the end of the week.  Would buy again"
positive,29/8/19,"I love this oil, it smells great, it works its magic, it's great for babies, it's great for moms. If you use cloth diapers it's awesome. Strongly recumbent it instead of all those products full of chemicals like Johnson&Johnson stuff..."
positive,7/2/21,"I was looking for a water mix-in without artificial sweetners. This uses Stevia, which I use at home. Just what I was looking for. It has fruit punch taste with tons of Vitamin C to boot."
positive,14/10/21,"great taste the only complait is that they are a little big in size to put in everyone mouth , they should of made them a little smaller and thicker"
positive,7/8/20,"Nearly perfect snack chip. Just a trifle too much salt and sugar keep them from getting 5 stars. The air pockets in the chips make them crisp but tender. The flavor is similar to kettlecorn, but thankfully not as sweet."
positive,1/3/20,Nice to see more than one flavor in a case. My cat really likes this one. Likes the extra gravy ones the best. Wish they sold them in varriety packs. They use meat by-products in their food. I could not get my cat to eat any thing else. She did not like the natural food. Up to you.
positive,28/7/20,"Have been using this in my morning chai for several months now and it is absolutely incredible.  The only ""bad"" thing I can say about it is that it can be a little addictive :)<br /><br />Follow up: We usually like to use cream in our coffee as a treat on the weekends (half-nhalf - what's that??).  The other day we were out so I used the Santini condensed milk instead.  All I can say is, wow!  Actually enjoyed it more than cream - and then I compared the labels.  The condensed milk has considerably less saturated fat and cholesterol than cream.  We're never going back!"
positive,14/9/21,Bought this because our new son-in-law loves it and they could not find it in stores anywhere.<br />He was thrilled.
negative,17/12/20,"I really love herbal tea, especially honey and vanilla. But all of Teekanne's teas were tasteless and even if you put two packages in a cup of tea you still get no taste. Now I have three packages of Teakanne (2 relaxing and 1 energizing) and I don't know what to do with it. Surely will not drink it."
positive,2/5/20,I love juice.  It is my favorite beverage.  Now this product adds a little zing to regular fruit juice.  It is ver<br />refreshing and a great beverage.  Love the flavors.  Not sugary sweet but a little tart and with the carbonations a little zing.
positive,14/7/21,"This tastes like actual soda pop. you'd never know it was healthy for you! every can is lightly carbonated and gives you 100% vitamin c and contains 100 percent real fruit juice. what more can you ask for? I got the variety pack and all the flavors taste good. I only wish amazon kept it in stock for the subscribe and save."
positive,18/7/19,"Switch Bev taste great, my fav was the grape but they all have a great taste.  Most important my kids love them!"
positive,1/3/20,"First, my shipment arrived without any dent or leak in any of the cans which is awesome.<br />I will begin to review all the flavors (except for cherry, I have not tried the cherry one) :<br /><br />- Grape : This one is my favorite. It tastes almost like normal grape soda but you can still taste the real fruit juice. It leaves the after taste of real grape juice. The carbonation is about the right amount.<br /><br />- Orange : My second favorite flavor. It was very yummy and taste very real. If you let a friend drink it, he/she will be able to tell it is made from real juice and not artificial flavor.<br /><br />- Lemon lime : Great combination of flavors. The tartness is just right but the flavor is just ok, nothing impressive.<br /><br />- Kiwi/berry & Watermelon/strawberry : I found these two too sweet. The kiwi/berries taste is too strong it almost reminds me of artificial flavors in candy.<br /><br />- Cherry : I did not try this flavor but my boyfriend said it is his favorite and he loves it.<br /><br />Bottom line : Get this variety pack to see what flavors you like. My bf and I both love carbonated drinks but stopped drinking regular soda a while ago due to high fructose corn syrup.  The can size is a little small but it is easy to pack with your lunch to take on the go."
positive,28/7/20,Wonderful selection of peppers in one shaker container!  Arrived in great time and exactly as described.
positive,13/6/20,Do you want people to think you ran out to the theater to buy popcorn? This product is great and has that theater taste.
positive,10/3/20,This is very tasty!  We have tried other<br />k cup hot chocolates and feel this is the best option.
positive,9/5/20,I am so glad that Swiss Miss has the K-cup products. I have one every morning as I do not drink coffee :0) Perfect amount of flavor. Not to watery and not to strong.
positive,14/5/19,This adds something special to a regular burger and fries.  My husband loves spicy foods and he loves the kick that this gives him.
positive,19/10/20,"Tasty.  Better than others I've bought and good price.  The bag helps keep them moist too as opposed to the canisters."
positive,1/3/20,"Rosemary is nothing like Peppermint ! As it has much more subtle taste ! At a Tablespoon in 20 oz. of drinking water it is still not harsh, kind of mild ! According to Miracle Food Cures from the Bible it is supposed to help with memory and old age ! It's easy to imagine Rosemary Chicken ! Over seasoning would be hard to do ! This great stuff as it has been around a long time ! Thank You !!!!"
positive,28/7/20,"I've never ordered canned goods online before this so I was nervous. Boy, what a great experience! I don't have access to a Asian market where I am and I really wanted to make masaman rather than order take out. I followed the recipe on the can, reducing it by half as was recommended in one of the reviews. It was really flavorful and a tad spicy, I might even try a quarter of the amount next time. So happy that this worked out!"
positive,7/3/20,"This coffee tastes great and arrives fresh and ready to brew.  It is a nice dark roast that is 100% Kona, not a blend.  Will keep ordering!"
positive,4/8/20,"i love the flavor and taste of these bars.  the multigrain is made up of oats and barley, giving the crust a fresh taste and not crumbly.  the triple berries is a nice blend and there is not one overwhelming flavor between the crust and berries.  150 calories, 29g of carbs.  it is a tasty and filling bar.  highly recommended for a breakfast treat along with a good cup of coffee!"
positive,26/12/19,"These aren't the healthiest things a person could eat, but they are better for you than a lot of the breakfast bars available. My 2 year old loves them, so we have them on subscribe and save. She asks for these whenever she wants a snack."
positive,28/3/21,These cereal bars are fantastic. All of their verities have great fruit flavors and not to mention NO added sugar (fruit juice sweetened and plenty sweet enough). Perfect for a mid-morning snack or otherwise.
negative,6/2/20,"The leaf in the bag and the overall packaging quality is good but no one in our family and group of friends likes the taste.<br /><br />Since it has all the other positive reviews, I've been subjecting people to it off and on since my July purchase trying to find at least one person to say it tastes good - with no luck.<br /><br />It doesn't taste like peaches to us; it has an off taste that makes our gang say yuck.  We like many different kinds of flavored hot tea and switch between drinking black or green iced tea (usually decaf and usually made as sun tea). Some of us add sweetener; some of us don't. We like peaches both fresh and canned. For these reasons, I can't blame our dislike of the taste on the simple fact that it is flavored and a green tea.  Maybe the passion fruit in it someone else mentioned ""isn't our cup of tea""?"
positive,25/4/21,this curry pates really helped me cut back on time i would spend to make a good meal .will definitely buy again
positive,3/8/20,"Recommended by a friend, I am a big green tea lover, would like to try out anything with green tea flavor, this soil milk tastes rich but not too sweet,enjoyed it a lot, will order more in the future"
positive,15/4/19,This is a very tasty & nutritional bar full of nuts & fruit. But they are made in China.  Not knowing the safely quality I eat these sparingly
positive,9/3/18,These chocolate chips taste great and have a creamy texture. Even when meltling the consistancy is creamy and yummy.  I use them for baking gluten free cookies and breads.
positive,18/5/18,"We are SO grateful for these in our family.  We are gluten, dairy and soy free, so to be able to bake for my children is a huge blessing.  These taste awesome, and I am a picky girl when it comes to gluten, dairy and soy free and how it tastes."
positive,9/3/18,"I needed these for my toddler granddaughter who has allergies to dairy, egg, and peanuts.  This product is free from all that worry.  The chips are small, love that, b/c I even use this in my cannoli filling and can pipe it out of a star-tip pastry bag w/o clogging up the works. They taste absolutely identical to any other chocolate chip, not 'off' tasting. In the health-food stores, this is about $5 a bag.  At this price I can bake with it and use more w/o worry of being a spendthrift. I made allergy-safe chocolate chip cookies with these yesterday and I had to stop myself from eating them all...a great product."
positive,27/2/18,"This is one of the better gluten free crusts I've tried. I prefer it to all the pre-made crusts. It takes some prep time, but the slightly doughy texture is well worth the wait. It is good, if not better, than crust I've had in gluten free pizzerias."
positive,20/2/18,"this is the most versatile, tasty, nutritious product ive come to encounter. can be used as cereal, a snack, etc. delicious and nutritious."
positive,22/3/18,"Great product, with nice big chunks.  Not like other granola that gets broken into little, itty bitty pieces."
positive,12/3/18,This tea is truly from the highlands in Kenya and tastes great.  It is refreshing with a great flavor.  The packages was delivered on time and intact.<br />We usually drink tea (with milk) in the evening and this tea adds to the relaxation after a long day.
positive,9/2/18,"I use this product with my plain yogurt and add some fresh fruit, thus avoiding the "" fruit "" yogurts that have artificial sweeteners and high fructose corn syrup. For those concerned with calories and sugars, this is a pleasant alternative."
positive,7/12/17,"Drew's makes some fantastic dressings.  Their Italian dressing, for example, is amazing, especially when dipped with bread.  I was pretty confident this would be a great dressing and I was not disappointed.  I made a salad with crispy wontons, red onion, toasted almond slivers, mandarin oranges and a couple of tomatoes and then put this dressing on top -- WOW.  It was a great salad.  I recommend this product highly.<br /><br />I purchased this dressing at my local co-op for about two dollars.<br /><br />Ingredients:  Canola Oil Expeller Pressed, Orange(s) Juice Concentrated, Soy Sauce ( Organic ) (Water, Soybean(s), Wheat, Salt Sea) , Rice Wine Vinegar, Sesame Oil Toasted, Water, Cane Sugar Juice Evaporated, Garlic, Ginger, Lemon(s) Juice, Mustard Dijon (Water, Mustard Seed, Corn Vinegar Distilled, Salt Sea, Wine White, Turmeric, Spice(s)) , Cilantro, Pepper(s) Black, Citric Acid, Xanthan Gum<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 tbsp<br />Servings Per Container: 24<br /><br />Calories 70<br />Total Fat 7 g<br />Saturated Fat 0 g<br />Trans Fat 0 g<br />Cholesterol 0 mg<br />Sodium 110 mg<br />Potassium 0 mg<br />Total Carbohydrate 2g<br />Dietary Fiber 0g<br />Sugars 1 g<br />Protein 0 g<br /><br />If interested in Drew's dressing and you want to explore alternative options, try iherb.com.

positive,24/5/19,My son loves these.  He loves the taste and that he can even share these snacks with friends and no one knows they are gluten free.
positive,9/3/18,"I wondered how it would taste?  well, it is awesome and K cups are too easy!  Will be ordering again soon."
positive,18/5/18,"This is the best K-cup tea I've found so far. It tastes very good and doesn't use the word ""exotic"" to add random spices that are not necessary. It is surprisingly rich and flavorful."
positive,23/3/18,I love Chai tea- and these little Keurig K-cups are excellent. My only wish is that they would make a non-dairy one as these have milk in them.
positive,8/9/20,"I find this product to be a fantastic alternative to the energy drinks I usually consume to get over the mid day hump. While it will not facilitate all nighters, it enhances my mood and increases my ability to focus.  It has a very clean taste with non of that chemically after taste you experience with Red Bull, Rockstar, Monster, or even VitaminEnergy.  I truly feel happier, and more productive after a BrainToniq."
positive,23/2/18,"Excellent low-carb option for people on low-carb diets. Also a very tasty product even if you are not... I deep fried a few of them just to see how it worked and they were even better (and definitely much worse for me health wise!). Overall, extremely well made and high quality product!"
positive,18/7/20,"These <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007MCRP7K"">Halawi Dates</a> are very tasty!  Incredibly healthy and tasty?  No brainer.  I much prefer the taste of these Halawi dates to the more common Medjool dates."
positive,14/6/18,"Great taste and very fresh.  We order and buy cashews often and sometimes run into stale cashews.  After many bags, not one cashew was stale or foul.  Crunchy, salty and a treat."
positive,2/11/18,"I'm not sure about the claims that sour sop kills cancer cells, but I'm hoping it does.  Even if it doesn't, it is a great tasting drink.  I'm sure it has health benefits, too."
positive,14/10/18,"In the great British trifecta of British powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar, Horlicks the most malty, Milo is medium chocolately and malty, and Ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately.<br /><br />All 3 are basically comfort drinks when plain milk just won't do. All 3 are powders to which you add milk and sugar to get a sweet malty drink, the latter two with chocolate flavor as well.<br /><br />I love all 3 drinks. But, if you are drinking this for nostalgia's sake, make sure you get the Ovaltine from where ever your nostalgia springs from because Ovaltine is made in different countries and they all taste a little different. For me, Ovaltine is the most chocolately of all 3 and a great comfort drink for cold nights. I like it more than simply hot chocolate because it's not as sweet and has a slight malty flavor to it. Best of all, you can control the taste because you can adjust the amounts of sugar and Ovaltine you add."
positive,6/4/20,These noodles are delicious and surprisingly my favorite of all the flavors so far. I orderd some for my daughter also and son.
positive,9/3/18,"Just a hint of honey and lemon, perfect balance, great taste, doesnt even need to be sweetened."
positive,18/5/18,Gives popcorn a pleasing color and lets the corn pop fully. I have been very satisfied. I will purchase more of this.
positive,7/3/18,"These are a delicious meatless alternative to meatballs and work perfectly with marinara sauce, or simply heated in their own gravy."
positive,24/1/19,"These chips are awesome and semi-healthy.  However, you can buy them cheaper at Costco.  I got a 16 oz bag there for $5.29, which works out to 33 cents per ounce.  If you buy them through Amazon, you pay 52 cents per ounce."
positive,27/2/19,"I really like these crackers and I'm thrilled that Amazon offers this product. I'm a Bariatric patient and it's always hard to find a crunchy treat that is healthy.  I save a ton of money too because buying individual boxes was getting quite pricey for me since I eat at least 2 crackers each day.  I've tried all 3 flavors that Amazon offers; they all are quite tasty, but this one is my all-time favorite."
positive,19/4/20,These are my favourite flavour of rice crackers.  They are especially great with hummus!
positive,17/4/20,"Item taste wonderful, is easy to use and is a great price.  Gave one to my sister who has alergies to regular soy sauce."
positive,3/4/20,"We happened to be at Whole Foods and a lovely woman was offering free samples of Violas Hot Jalepeno Jelly. Omg It is fantastic! It's got a definite kick to it but it's not too terribly hot at all. PERFECTION. It's just sweet enough to balance out the hot. It's light and delicious. And best of all, it's not full of all the artificial preservatives and high fructose corn syrup and additives of which most jellies are contaminated.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!"
positive,7/8/19,"I've tried to capture the taste of really fine coffee I've experienced in some excellent restaurants without much success--including grinding my own beans, buying expensive ones at specialty shops, etc.  This product, while not quite doing justice to my memories of great coffee, comes closest.  It is somewhat expensive at about $9/lb.  Supermarket coffees are, of course, much cheaper--and you can get larger packages at discount places for much, much less.  I even tried mixing this coffee with Folgers--and it was pretty good too.  Naturally, this coffee is much richer so one needs to experiment a bit to figure out how much to use in your coffee maker.  I drink coffee straight up--no sweetener, no milk products, but I like it pretty strong--but not burnt or over-roasted.  This coffee is not over-roasted or bitter (unless you use too much of it).  I found it superior to the other Melitta products I've tried as well as to other much-vaunted brands such as Starbucks, Seattle's Best, and Gevalia.  But taste is on the tongue of the beholder..."
positive,9/3/18,"UPDATE JANUARY 2011<br />I am now a pretty regular drinker of this stuff! In fact, I just ordered some more and I note the price has gone down which makes it very afforable, take in the free shipping, and it's an absolutely delicious  steal!<br /><br />I am really enjoying this Coffee. I usually drink Folgers at home and have done so for nearly 20 years. This was a pleasant surprise, the aroma as it was brewing was scintillating, the taste (with my regular creamer and sugar) was a treat for my taste buds.<br />I finished two cups and was tempted to drink more because it was such a smooth tasting coffee. I used 6 heaped tea-spoon fulls for make 8 cups (as marked on my coffee maker) and it worked out just about right for me; though some hard line coffee drinkers make like it stronger than that!<br />The package itself was a little hard to open, I found the best way was to cut the top off with scissors and use the metal bands on the package to securely close it as airtight as possible.<br /><br />This a really nice coffee but the only way to be sure you will like it is to try it."
positive,18/5/18,"I have long been a fan of German based Melitta products, and found their coffee to be far superior to most of the mainstream popular coffees, and even some so called ""exclusive"" or ""select"" blends.<br />Blanc et Noir is one selection from their Cafe Collection, which I would put in the medium to dark roast catagory.<br />A full bodied flavor without acidity, but not too strong. That is when made in French press, I don't use old style ""leave it in the pot all day"" machines.<br />A lot of people have switched to the pod type or single cup brewing systems lately, and in fact coffee consumption seems down in general, in favor of herb teas and non caffeinated drinks. So it was nice to go back to an old style ground coffee taste.<br />If you like European style ground coffees, you may also like to try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CJJKRU"">Douwe Egberts Intense - Real Coffee Dark Roast Ground Coffee, 8.8-Ounce Packages (Pack of 3)</a> which is Dutch, or the bold flavored <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVIRCU"">Jacobs Kr&ouml;nung Coffee, 8.81-Ounce Vacuum Packs (Pack of 4)</a>.<br /><br />Another point worth mentioning is cost, these value packs here work out pretty cheap compared to pod systems bags or cups, and are even not that bad compared to everyday grocery store prices. When compared to gourmet stores like Gevalia, they are a steal, and great quality."
positive,27/1/19,"These bars were recommended to me by a nutritionist and fitness expert.  They are wonderful.  If you like chocolate, you will love these bars.  They are also very good for you with all organic ingredients."
positive,10/11/19,My Son turned me on to this product and it is one of the best new products around. Just minutes makes a pitcher of tea that tastes like it has steeped for hours. I buy this product on subscribe and save which is cheaper than Walmart and keep it all year round. Thanks Amazon for a wonderful product and the convenience of having it delivered to my door.
positive,8/11/19,"I've always been a little curious about barley tea, as I see it often mentioned in manga and Japanese stories. I finally got a chance to try it the other day with the Sokenbicha brand.<br /><br />This tea is not sweetened, which is part of the reason I purchased it. I'm on a diet, so I prefer to sweeten my beverages with stuff like Splenda or Equal. I didn't really need it with this drink. There's a slight bitter tea taste, but it's definitely not overwhelming and I didn't really think that it deterred from the drink. To be honest, I didn't add any sweetener to it at all. It didn't need it and I think it would have killed the taste.<br /><br />There's a great nutty-ish type of flavor that I'm going to assume is the barley. I adore it and while I don't think I'd be able to drink it constantly, I really want to drink this again, to the point where I'd be willing to drive to the organic grocery store that's about a half hour out of my way. I do have to warn you, if you are a fan of the more traditional teas (black tea, iced tea, etc) then this will take some getting used to. It's tasty, but I can see where it wouldn't be to all tastes. Still very much worth trying and I'm definitely going to be looking for barley tea in general. (But stuff like this is good for me to take to work, where I can't brew up big batches of tea.)"
positive,25/10/21,"""I am so impressed. This is the best price I have ever seen for this product, The quality is awesome, and they had it shipped to me so fast that I had it within a week. Fantastic price, quality and service. Don't get no better than that !!""<br />( My husband and I are hooked, this is delicious. After eating this you will never go back to rolled, processed, 1-minute oatmeal !!)"
positive,8/5/20,I like this so much that I use it in most of the foods that need a pork flavor. I have even used it in home made baked beans.
positive,28/9/18,"This lo carb pancake mix is really good and easy to make.<br /><br />You can't even tell it's a lo carb product. I made some pancakes with it and give one to my boyfriend. He couldn't even tell it was a lo carb product.<br /><br />I would buy this again."
positive,29/7/19,"i love this tea its got a great taste and doesn't leave you all jumpy and wired after you drink it. the ONLY thing i have against this tea is that it is cut very small, small enough to drift out of my infuser and leave a bunch of loose tea in my tea..."
positive,9/3/18,"Not only is this tea delicious, but it's organic and very cheap! I've bought Rooibos from over 5 other stores, and it has never been this cheap or this good! Davidson's for the win"
positive,18/5/18,"We have been paying big bucks for little cans of Rooibos tea at the health food store and brewing ice tea with it that we drink by the gallon. I was surprised that the Davidson's Rooibos was richer and tastier and brewed up a nice clear amber/brown color. Better quality and less expensive!"
positive,17/5/20,"Cranberry Grape XS has a wonderful taste and helps give me energy for my daily workouts with out the ""crash"" effect later in the day. XS, unlike other energy drinks, balances out the day."
positive,26/3/20,These almonds deliver the crunch of freshness that I love in nuts! Some nuts you can tell are old because of their softness but these almonds are incredible and tasty! Great for a quick pick me up!
positive,24/2/20,"These are one my favorite kind of Sun Chips. They have a zesty taste that is not too sharp or bland, with just the right ""kick"",  and a nice crisp texture. While these are not a health food, their sodium and fat content is much better than other snack foods. These chips work really well with a dip and vegetables for a pre-dinner snack.<br /><br />Shop for price. The price printed on the 10.5 oz bag that I buy at my local supermarket is $3.79 (and I pay less on sale), so the price on Amazon is higher than the manufacturer's suggested retail price."
positive,3/5/19,"This is very tasty. Good deal to save a few bucks here on Amazon as well. I find this dish very similar to the Chicken Tikka Masala. Both are great, obviously this curry dish has more curry flavor than the Chicken Tikka Masala. The chicken in this dish is wonderful as well."
positive,27/3/20,"Generally speaking, I really like mini wheats, so this cereal was appealing to me already.  I enjoyed the flavor very much since it didn't taste artificial.  I also liked the fact that it contains brown rice syrup in it instead of corn syrup.  It gives it a different flavor that enhances the cinnamon and combines very well with the wheat.<br /><br />My active teen daughter is a big breakfast eater and if she eats cereal, she's usually hungry within a couple of hours.  This kind held her for 4 hours.  It is hard to measure 47 pieces (serving size) so we just served about a cup which is a little more than what the average cereal calls for.<br /><br />Overall, the cereal tasted good and was good for the tummy.  I'm looking forward to buying some more."
positive,31/12/20,"These are moist, soft and chewy with a really nice texture.  The cinnamon flavor is really good -- nice and strong (I love cinnamon!) and really natural tasting, not artificial like a lot of cinnamon flavors.  They are a little on the small side (like 5 or 6 bites) but also pretty low cal (150 cals) so they make a nice snack or light breakfast.  I will definitely be buying these again!"
positive,13/1/20,"We love making special coffees and this just added a great touch to them.<br />Also we have put it on top of our soy ice cream and found it to have a nice taste on that as well;)OH we have also added it to our soda, making vanilla coke, vanilla dr. pepper and vanilla orange soda.. Very Very NICE:)"
positive,21/9/20,"I'm pretty new to the coffee scene, but I really like this roast. It is quite flavorful and rich. It was the first coffee I bought, I tried a few more and I came back to this."
positive,2/12/20,"i have a weak spot for grape soda (among other not so good for you treats). admittedly i don't pay that much attention to what goes into them, but i do try to moderate what i consume from time to time.<br /><br />this stuff is great! tastes almost as deliciously bad for you as the real thing, but since it's not as syrupy as welch's grape soda, it actually is more refreshing after downing the whole can.<br /><br />if you're concerned with all the bad stuff in the other stuff, but can't keep away, give this one a try."
positive,20/11/19,"Great carbonated beverage. My son gets it at school and loves it.  I can't find in local stores so I bought it here.<br />Kids love it."
positive,2/12/20,Purchased this water at first due to the fact I needed the water bottle to fit into a drink holder/case.  It was a win win situation because it tasted great too!
positive,11/12/19,"Fantastic espresso beans!  I usually drink Illy, but thought I would give this a 'shot'... and I was not disappointed! This has a slightly smokier flavor than the Illy roasts, produces a NICE crema, and is ultra smooth.<br /><br />In short, give this a try.  Highly recommended for my fellow coffee heads out there..."
positive,20/11/19,"I have had it with brisket, turkey and chicken fingers. It is great on everything. Just the right amount of kick. It is hard to describe, sweet but spicey. My kids love it, their ages are nine to nineteen."
positive,28/6/20,"Arrived room temperature... but I knew that would happen given the other reviews. I figured they were probably ok still and ate them- they taste good and I didn't get sick so I think that it is fine.  I would purchase again once I run out..."
positive,8/8/20,"I bought this because I thought it was the same as white sweet potato flour. I was disappointed but then after I baked cookies w/ it, they were actually good. Gluten-free, egg-free, dairy-free.  Will taste great though if you added eggs.<br /><br />I thought I'd share my recipe<br /><br />1 cup sweet potato flour<br />1/4 cup canola oil(or safflower)<br />1/8 cup honey<br />1/4 cup water (or any other non-dairy milk substitute)<br />a dash of salt<br />1/2 TB baking powder<br /><br />Optional: chocolate chip cookies, shredded coconut and or almond pieces or any other nuts.<br /><br />Mix everything and roll into small balls. Flatten on cookie sheet covered with baking sheet. Bake for 10-14 minutes or til firm. They burn easily so watch."
positive,14/7/21,"The Ambrosoli Honees Energy plus Vitamin Caramels were absolutely delicious! You definitely get a caramel taste without the stickiness. I can't speak to the vitamin aspect but it does give you a little energy shake up. I kept a pack in my purse and during long tiring speeches, I sneaked one and it kept me awake. The wrappers are noisy but worth it!"
positive,2/12/20,We drink a lot of iced tea in the summer and this is a nice change to put in the rotation so there is a little variety.
positive,20/11/19,This is a very tasty ready to eat Indian meal. The curry is especially delicious. I will likely buy again.
positive,1/3/21,"I have been drinking Folgers Colombian coffee since I first moved to the US over 10 years ago.  I tried some of the other mass-produced coffees first but couldn't find one that I liked.  I was thrilled to find this one.  It tastes perfect to me.  I had stopped buying it when the price in my local supermarket kept creeping up so I was really happy to find it on Amazon (Subscribe and Save) cheaper than my local supermarket. That is an added bonus. The only reason that I gave it four stars is that there are better coffees out there (in my opinion), just not for the same price."
positive,5/5/21,"Nice aromas, wonderful exotic taste! Definately for people who like to sample exotic cuisines. Reminds me of being in southeast Asia. Love it!"
positive,2/12/20,"I purchased this for one brother on the recommendation of my oldest brother and I could not locate the brand anywhere in my local area.  So, just hoping by chance Amazon would have this item, I scroll through and bingo.  The projected delivery date was not going to arrive in time for Thanksgiving so I was told.  But, it arrived within two business days.  My family was very delighted to say the least."
positive,20/11/19,"I drink Crystal Light like it was ...water!  This is a good flavor when you want to break out of the ordinary berry/orange/grape, etc.  It is not too tart like lemonade can be nor too bitter as pomegrante can be.  I do not drink this flavor every day but it is a nice change from my regular flavors!"
positive,9/10/21,"This particular flavor is almost impossible to find,and in my opinion,it is one of the best.I was very happy to find it on Amazon(what can't you find on Amazon?).This flavor is tart and refreshing,just right for Arizona summers,where i happen to live.It is not even halfway through  June, and the temps are triple digits! Thank goodness for this wonderful drink,which also keeps me hydrated...just mix with water and you are good to go."
positive,6/3/21,"For whatever reason, my local grocer does not carry Cinnamon Toast Crunch. I was happy to find it here on Amazon.<br /><br />The bags of cereal in this box are nice and large!  This has lasted about as long as 4 regular boxes of cereal, and we still have some left.<br /><br />I was skeptical about buying cereal this way, but it turned out to be a pretty good deal after all!"
positive,12/2/21,"Very hot, but smooth, great consistancy, for use with most Korean cusine. Just a dab will do, you don't want too much. This items is tasty, but extremely hot. Great side with most Korean dishes"
positive,2/12/20,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A1LGIY"">Crystal Light Mocktails Appletini</a> tastes great<br /><br />It's like drinking a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IKM0S"">Jones Soda Green Apple</a> but without all the carbonation or calories.<br /><br />my only issue is that they use Aspartame. with all the dangers that come with it, it'd be nice if they use stevia instead.<br /><br />Other than that, if you're looking for a great apple tasting diet beverage, this is pretty good."
positive,20/11/19,"This is a tad better to me than the Mojito flavor. It's final mix is a translucent green. It's not too sweet but doesn't have that totally artificial-tasting twang to it either. I would definitely buy on my own."
positive,25/6/21,"I'd seen an add for these in a magazine recently, but my local grocery store hasn't had them in stock, so I was really glad to get the chance to try the Appletini flavor out.  It's delicious!  While it certainly doesn't taste like the real thing, it's got a nice, light flavor that is different from all the other powdered drink mixes out there.<br /><br />Also, a few reviewers mentioned that it tastes a bit like a Jolly Rancher in its sourness, but I don't think that it's sour at all.<br /><br />I try not to drink more than one glass of Crystal Light a day because I worry about the aspartame in it, which this one also has.<br /><br />Overall, a really tasty drink!  I'm eager to try to mojito one next."
positive,17/3/20,"I love the sauce with steak.  I haven't tried using it with anything suggested on the bottle yet.  With a nice Filet, though, delicious!!!"
positive,20/10/21,"Pretty good sampling of their standard flavors.  I believe the only flavors missing are the ham ones (Gravy & Ham and Ham & Cheese), which I'd love to try.<br /><br />The bacon flavor is good, but the bacon is a little odd.  Cheddar Cheese is the best, and Butter is good, too.  Plus, each pack (12 per box) is only 100 calories.  Good for a warm snack when you're feeling nibbly.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that I'd rather they ditched the original flavor and replaced it with something more interesting."
positive,21/7/20,"These are really good and healthy. Use the ""Subscribe & Save"" option because you can always have them skip a shipment (or cancel whenever). Watch the price though as it fluctuates greatly. I paid 9.51 for mine (including shipping with ""Subscribe & Save"")."
positive,22/2/21,Very tasty snack.  I have re-ordered this item twice already.  Too bad the price increased $4.00 since my last order though.
positive,8/6/21,This is a very good mix at a reasonable price. I snack on trail mix at work and put 1 of these out in the snack area with the standard pretzels and candy. My fellow employees must have liked since it was gone within a day
positive,2/12/20,"ordered this as a healthy snack, and everyone seems to like it around my household, the packaging wasn't the best so one bag ripped open during shipment, other than that it's all good."
positive,20/11/19,"These mints are tasty with a nice kick.  I can't chew gum due to jaw pain and really enjoy a mint after eating to freshen up my breath.  After realizing that many mints contain aspartame, which I'm trying to avoid these days, I searched and found these to my delight.  I haven't seen them in stores, so I'll be ordering other flavors in the future online."
positive,25/1/21,PROS_______THIS CEREAL IS GREAT TASTING.....fills you up new box color NOT LIKE IN THE PICTURE..yellow is a good color......PROTIEN......im eating it while i type this review<br /><br />CONS______small 11.5 ounce boxes.....HOW LONG WILL THAT LAST......you dont have any......you have to spend money on this........when its gone you become very sad.....your always wanting more but have to wait for the next order...<br /><br />5 stars out of 5
positive,1/7/21,"Found these at Meijer's. Couldn't wait to try them. I think these are better than the regular chocolate ones. A much better chocolate flavor. Love them! Will be buying these instead of the other ones."
positive,30/9/20,"This is the cake part, you need to add your own Amaretto to it. And it really beats making your own!"
positive,15/3/20,"This is as good as you can get in a commercial product.  If you like a rich caponata you'll like this product."
positive,6/7/21,"I wanted something simply convenient to mix up with the spring water hot tap.  Caffe D'Vita fits the bill.  I like the pumpkin spice flavor as well as the 16 oz size.  It is great for a little pick me up on a chilly day."
positive,29/6/21,"Falling asleep in class? Staying up late for that end of the year project? Coffee machine broken or too expensive? Jolt energy gum gives you energy quickly, with a great taste and at a great price. You can't always drink coffee, but you can always have a piece of gum. I'd recommend this product to anyone and everyone. I gave out packs of this to a lot of my friends at the end of last semester before finals."
positive,29/6/21,"I ordered the 35 pack.  Maybe I just got lucky but I had an excellent variety!  I have 19 different kinds, doubles of the majority.  With one flavor I got 3. There were probably 7 decafs.  They were thrown into the box, but none were damaged.  Overall, I'm happy and I'll probably order again."
positive,26/7/21,"I bought Big Hunks when I came across them in retail stores, which wasn't very often.  When I did find them, they were usually kind of stale from sitting there for a while.  I came across this offer on Amazon and was impressed with the price so placed an order.  The box arrived quickly and I was very happy to discover how fresh the candy turned out to be.  If you like fresh nougat, you will probably be very happy with this item."
positive,21/10/21,"This a a very tasty product and it makes all beat product taste good. I have been a fan of Kraft barbecue sauce for years but I just decide to try this brand Bulls's Eye. I am glad I did and I will be switching to this brand from now on."
positive,25/10/21,"I love Arizona iced tea, and this one is quite tasty, especially for a diet version.  A great combination of lemony tea.<br /><br />Please note that this review is specific to the product, not the price or the merchant."
negative,29/6/21,This company protected these cookies very well with great packaging but the taste is not there.  I would never purchase again.
positive,5/7/21,"Tried this, per package directions adding smoked sausage and cut up chicken tenders. Wow, was it ever good. I liked it so much that I immediately came back for another case in the event that this product might be out in the future. If you are a fan of Jambalya you will love this. Spicy but not overpowering. Made a HUGE amount. Three of us had dinner with grandson going back for seconds and there was still plenty for the next day for lunch. What is so great about this is that you can add anything you want to it and it would be great or fix it as is and still be happy! Try it!"
positive,17/9/21,"My husband bought this after growing to love this dish after living back east. We currently live in the western US, and I have never had this dish prior to him making it for me. So I cannot offer any comparison.<br />However, I do thoroughly enjoy this dish. When my husband called this Cincinnati CHILI, I got stuck on the chili part, so my taste buds were confused when I first tried this dish, because it doesn't particularly taste like the chili I am used to. After adjusting to the ""sweetness"", I really enjoy this dish more than my husband! It is NOT your typical chili with beans and ""spicy-ness"". It has a smoother consistency and the cinnamon, cloves and allspice give it a different taste entirely.<br /><br />It is a very easy meal to make. We have it ""4-way"" on top of noodles, with grated cheese and chopped onions on top. I should also mention to others not familiar with this dish is that it is not very substantial on its own. It is also delicious on top of turkey dogs."
positive,18/8/21,"I wanted to try Cherrytree Cola for no particular reason other than I'd heard Fentimans makes some pretty good drinks. So I ordered a few from Amazon, and they shipped in like three days. I absolutely love this soda. I don't drink much pop because the carbonation is overbearing for me, but this was different. It was much smoother than regular colas and had a great taste. The only downside is that it's expensive. I won't be purchasing more right away, but if I could I would!"
positive,31/7/21,"I've loved these since I was a kid, my mom has been giving them to me for Christmas ever since I discovered them.  Perfect amount of orange flavor blended in with delicious dark chocolate.  I had my boyfriend try these recently as well, he loves them too.  He has a mild milk allergy so he sometimes can't eat certain brands, but these don't bother him."
positive,18/10/21,Having a peanut allergic son this stuff makes a great substitute.  texture wise it is exactly like peanut butter but with a slight cinnamon after taste quite pleasant.  I found it in walmart for under $4 a jar so I would suggest shopping around some. I bought the creamy version but a crunchy version was also available..also much more cost friendly then the peanut-free almond butter that was to be found for like $9/jar
positive,29/6/21,"This is by far the best deal going for Oh Henry! bars that I've found anywhere, either online or in retail stores.  An entire 36-pack for under $20 is truly a great bargain, and I found the quality and freshness of the bars to be quite good.  Very satisfied with the purchase, and I will be re-ordering when this box has been devoured!"
positive,16/9/21,"These sugar-free sour gummi worms are wonderful. The taste is just like that of the regular sour gummi worms. The only problem with them is that they did not come with a suggested serving size. As you may or may not know, if you eat too much of these or most sugar-free products, there may be unintended... consequences. Limit 4 to 6 at a time, or you may find yourself limited to the bathroom. Other than that, they are great."
positive,24/8/21,"I've had instant and canned teas in the past and was less than impressed with those products, so I was hoping for something better with the MiO Sweet Tea.  At first I got the mixture wrong-- I put 1 tsp into 8 ounces of water.  There was too much of a citrus-like after taste, and of course the flavor in general was too strong.  Once I got the mixture right (use 1/2 tsp for every 8oz), my opinion changed.  The flavor is great, and I love it!  The 24 servings of this product were gone in no time, as I made 16 ounce servings frequently.  I imagine the liquid would easily stain clothing, so be careful as you squirt it out, but otherwise I have no reservations in recommending this."
positive,24/6/21,"The sweet tea flavor is very tasty and refreshing without any added sugar or calories.  It is very conveniently packaged for use away from home as well.  I just pop it in my purse and I'm good-to-go.  I get to control how much flavor is added according to my taste and mood.  Because it is a liquid, there is no concern with additive powders that don't dissolve properly.  I'm a fan."
positive,27/9/21,"My wife and I absolutely love these snacks.  They're somewhat ""healthy"" and they're very tasty.  After we purchased these we found them cheaper at Wal-Mart.  Since then though, Wal-mart went with a cheaper ""clone"" from another company.  It comes in a plastic container, has the exact same ingredients, and the price is a lot less than the name brand item."
positive,29/6/21,"These noodles are very tasty and light.  Not fried or greasy, lots of vegies.  A great lunch to go that won't fatten me up!  Love them!"
positive,5/8/21,"So often in the movies, when something upsetting happens, the first thing offered is a cup of tea.  There's just something soothing about it.  I'm no connoisseur, but I decided to branch out and try something a little exotic.  I'm glad I did, as this tea is really nice.  I like mine with a little honey and milk.  So good!"
positive,29/6/21,"I bought this after my local coffee house went out of  business and it helped me so much with the transition to a coffee free world.  The mocha mix has a lot of sugar and ingredients I'd rather not have on a daily basis, but oh, it tastes wonderful, so for an occasional treat, it's awesome.  I add a small amount to a healthier protein shake and it makes for a great desert."
positive,31/7/21,"I personally use it to make iced tea. It tastes great with a little sweetner. Tha acai is not overpowering as in other teas I've tried."
positive,11/9/21,"A nice little break from the traditional chocolate mint Andes candy.  The cherry jubilee is not too sweet, it's just right!  Package-wise, I always look at the weight of the candy and not the packaging. Can't go wrong with Andes. It's an office favorite with our software developers.  =)"
positive,12/8/21,"Fruit-flavored mentos are a delicious candy.  The flavor is teriffic.  Although there are several different colors, they all taste a bit the same to me, which is a general fruit flavor.  I also really enjoy the texture as well.  These mints are chewy on the inside, but on the outside, they have a bit of soft crunchy shell."
positive,31/7/20,"I purchased these to add drops of lemon juice to my water.  They're great!  I gave it 4 stars because I don't really have anything else to compare it to."
positive,13/6/20,"I think the negative reviews are a little harsh. This company is not alone in labeling their almonds raw even though they are most likely pasteurized. Is it right. I agree no, but when it comes to almond butter no matter what your choices are going to be either organic or not. So at least you know they are being grown healthier than the alternative.<br /><br />ALL almonds in the United States are pasteurized. You can go to health food/ co-oop store and most likely find imported raw almonds ( my store has some from Italy), but if you go to Whole Foods they are also going to try and sell you ""raw"" almonds that are not truly raw. Everyone seems to be in on the mislabeling.<br /><br />Anyway...google it and get educated if your interested.<br /><br />If you are looking for a great tasting organic almond butter at decent price you won't be disappointed with this one. As I scanned the negative reviews I don't think I remember them commenting that the taste wasn't great.<br /><br />For what's it's worth I tried Vitamixing my imported truly raw almonds to make my own almond butter, but still doesn't taste as good as this."
negative,31/7/20,These beans have absolutely no taste to them. Be prepared to add butter/salt while cooking them (and completely ruining the health factor in the process) if you plan to enjoy them.
negative,13/6/20,"This extract is strange... I put a little into my recipe and it sort of had an almost peanut buttery hint of flavor, but not quite, so i thought it needed a bit more. I put in the tiniest bit more and the flavor changed drastically and tasted not like peanut butter, but like alcohol. Not good at all."
negative,26/9/20,"looking for no points but this has a funny taste, on weight watchers but prefer pb2 so will take the 1 pt value"
positive,17/10/20,"I live in Texas. While visiting our daughter in SD recently, she purchased these at her local grocery store. She served as salad topping, but then we ate a couple of packages by the handfuls. I went back the next morning on our way back home and purchased all they had in the maple and cinnamon flavors. I emailed the company and asked where I could buy more locally (Texas). They advised that this is a new product and only available to date in the Midwest basically, but that I could order through Amazon! I am thrilled! These are fantastic! a little on the expensive side, but just learn to ""pace yourself"" and not eat too many! Maple is our favorite; cinnamon is good too; haven't tried banana flavor. Enjoy!"
positive,14/12/20,"I was introduced to a peach-flavored iced latte at work, and decided I wanted to try and made them at home.  This syrup worked great!  Highly recommended!"
positive,29/5/20,"I love the flavor of this tea, even though it is decaffeinated, it is one of the few decaf teas that still have a good robust taste.<br /><br />This and the Irish Breakfast (Decaf) are among my favorites."
positive,9/12/20,"These are good! Each roll is only 45 calories with 2g of sugars. They are similar in consistency to a rice cake, but slightly firmer due to the rice syrup. I think they taste sweeter than the 2g of sugars they contain, but not so sweet that you'd consider them candy or junk. They come packaged 8 rolls to a box. Because they're not individually wrapped, they can stick to one another in the package (although not to the extent that they're destroyed). Also, because there is no wrapper, although they are a decent snack for kids, they tend to leave little hands sticky. This order was for a dozen boxes. These are certainly good enough to order more than once, but I imagine it will take some time to get through the initial order. A 6-box option might be better."
positive,4/8/20,"I love peanut butter but occasionally have allergic reactions after eating it so, I avoid it when possible.  I first purchased ""SunButter"" after seeing it on QVC and BOY, was it wonderful!! I purchased it several times through QVC until they quit carrying it.  Fortunately I was able to purchase it again, through Amazon.  The pleasant, smooth, nutty flavor will keep me coming back for more!!!"
positive,31/7/20,"This Nustevia product is the best I have ever tried. There is no bitter taste. It is very sweet and only takes a few drops. On a previous review, I spoke about another product and how tasty it was. However, this one beats it by a long shot. I highly recommend it. I am glad I tried this one."
positive,13/6/20,"No aftertaste, isn't overpowering, doesn't mask the flavor of the food. We use this on our steel cut oats and protein drinks, no bitter aftertaste like the powders."
positive,21/11/20,"I made the first loaf of this on a quick setting on my bread machine, and it didn't rise very high.. I thought it was the bread mix and wasn't very happy with it. But I decided to give it another try, on the regular cycle.. I added a tablespoon of molasses because we like it in rye bread.. The loaf turned out beautiful, rose very high and tasted delicious... Very pleased with the results.."
positive,25/5/21,"This product tastes just like any other cinnamon bun!  I was skeptic at first...but the taste is very good.  Everybody at home liked them. At 3g net carbs, it is a treat you can afford in your coffee break in your low carb lifestyle."
positive,25/5/21,"My wife and I love this coffee.  The taste is awesome, the hint of mocha makes the coffee sooo smooth."
positive,20/1/21,"I love Sahale snacks and this one hits the mark.  It's got a little kick that is very satisfying. One thing that separates Sahale from other snack products is the variety of textures and flavors you get in every bite.  I highly recommend Sing Buri blend."
positive,15/1/21,"This is really just some good, clean tasting, hearty tomato sauce. The fact that it is organic is important to me, and it is also BPA free, so if you are concerned, dont be. Top notch product in my opinion, and one that i use at least twice a week in pasta and on pizzas.The s&s price in particular blows away normal grocer prices for this same can size.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
negative,8/2/21,"The other reviewers are CORRECT. I thought I would buy this in spite of the reviews because it was the only product available without traveling into a bigger town where there are Asian markets.  This is a huge waste of money. Totally tasteless,<br />Couldn't even fix it by adding spices and basil. Stay away."
positive,10/2/21,"This is the best cold tea I've ever had. It really works and has a great flavor. It gets rid of your cough and makes your throat feel better. I have strep right now, and this stuff works better than dayquil and doesn't have any side effects."
positive,9/10/20,The candy was fresh and tasted really good. It definitely was not hanging around some warehouse somewhere. I would order from this company again with no hesitation.
positive,31/7/20,This is a fantastic product.  Tastes better than McDonalds or Starbucks and less expensive at about $.51 per serving.  It comes in a great canister with a scoop to measure the frappe mix. I love it and recommend it to anyone who has a love of frappes.
positive,13/6/20,"I can only drink decaf.  Caffiene makes me nuts.  Most decaf teas are flat taste-wise.  This one has a rich, distinct flavor.  I highly recommend it."
positive,5/12/20,"This tea is among the best i have ever had! I am a tea addict, and the delightful licorice flavor running through this tea makes it delicious!"
positive,1/11/20,This Nori is a true bargain! 10 sheets of Nori at local grocery stores ran for as much as 1$ per sheet. 50 sheets at less than $10 is hard to beat. Really glad I got this as I am now making sushi several times a week!
positive,14/1/21,This nori tastes great at an affordable price.  This was the best price I have ever seen for a pack this size.
positive,6/6/21,"I have never used a coffee syrup but love Starbucks and though why not see how close I can get to that wonderful taste,,,I used this Torani Hazelnut Syrup just a small amount in most of my different flavors coffee it is sweet so you don't need any added sugar...Good price, shipping was high but would buy again, might try a different flavor..."
positive,21/7/20,"I must confess that I bought this product only because I wanted to see the pretty flower blossom inside the water. To my surprise, it smells and tastes really good too! And the flower is very pretty, totally worth it!"
positive,5/1/21,Hard to find Item. Delicious and easy to prepare. Kids love it! Arrived very fast!
positive,23/1/21,"I've been using this flour for the past 6 months or so for making bread and pizza dough; and for basically all my baking, including cakes. It has a great flavor that my family notices. My bread comes out perfect each time."
positive,31/7/20,"This coffee tastes great. I have tried Lavazza and other non organic brands, but the taste of this coffee is very good and the price is reasonable. I will purchase it again."
positive,13/6/20,Love these crackers and love PB2. i love peanut butter and this is a way to eat it without so many calories. These crackers have great flavor. just have to remember not to eat whole bag!!!
positive,1/12/20,"Sweet and tasty, my whole family love it. My secondary favorite chocolate brand (Lindt is always on the top of my list), cheaper than Lindt."
positive,30/1/21,Works great in my iced tea brewing machine that I use in my concession trailer. Tastes great! Customers cannot believe that we use Lipton tea & not some cheap off brand like almost every concession stand uses. We only serve our customers the best!!
positive,1/1/21,"This is a great product if you like a touch of ""hot"" on your pasta.  We first purchased it about 10 years ago when we were in Myrtle Beach.  It is hard to find where we live.  My husband will not eat his pasta withot this.  I also put a few shakes of it in my sauce when I am cooking it.  In this quantity it only flavors the sauce and does not make it hot to taste.  The biggest problem is that it is not often available.  I wish Amazon would stock it on a regulary basis."
positive,11/1/21,"I really like the flavor but I don't have much choice anyways, not many pizza spices brands out there to buy. I used to buy McCourmick but they discontinued their pizza spices (I really loved their hot version). But I do like this pizza spice anyways. I just sprinkle on top of my pizza slice as I am eating it."
positive,31/7/20,"I fell in love with this product.  I find artificial sweeteners sadly lacking in flavor or as stimulating to my taste buds as a flat soda.  This product has saved me.  I use it in everything I would use regular sugar for.  My favorite way to use it is to make lemon sorbet.  Talk about satisfying my sweet tooth and staying within my dietary guidelines, this is the one for me.  Now I want to find a ""brown sugar"" variation of this.  Raley's supermarket used to carry Smart Sugar and then quit stocking it.  I bought every last one on the shelf to tide me over until I could find another source.  Thanks to Amazon, I can now quit hoarding my supply and use it more freely.  I'll be placing my order for 5 bags very soon.  Thanks to everyone involved in the production of Smart Sugar!"
positive,13/6/20,"I have always like sardines and recently decided to start eating them on nearly a daily basis.  I bought two cases of these Season sardines in water and started taking them to work to eat as a snack.  I really like the taste!  These came 3 to a can, seemed to be of the larger type.  They still had the skin and bones, which was fine by me.  I love the taste of fish, so I didn't have much interest in the skinless and boneless, bland tasting ones."
positive,14/1/21,"I am on my third or fourth bottle.  Am not sure how well the health benefits are working out but I really like it because it adds flavor to different drinks.  I usually add a little bit to my orange juice or water once a day to give it a nice flavor. It probably taste good because it's mostly concentrated pomegranate juice."
positive,7/12/20,"Wonderful packaging, small glass containers full of anchovy goodness that you can throw in the frige after extracting what you need. Clean tiny boned (very edible) fillets are perfect for anything from sauce to toppings. Due to other reviews, I recommend using the first fillets you pull out from the middle for sauce (slightly broken up), the the others come out whole just fine with a cocktail fork.<br /><br />I will order these again and again."
positive,5/5/21,"Had Demitris in a restaurant, and now it has become the go-to for tailgating and gatherings.  Easy to mix (and regulate the spiciness).  Only problem was that Amazon's packing when shipping caused one bottle to leak all over the box."
positive,23/11/20,"Bob's Red Mills lentils are my favorite legume. They have a slightly sweet taste and cook very fast- 20-30 minutes. Be careful not to over-cook them because they are very tender and will fall apart, still tasty though. The soup I make calls for sauteed carrots, celery, & onion. Add ham or sausage if you wish. 1 garlic clove, oregano, salt (if you haven't added salty ham), and optional hot pepper flakes. It is very hardy and filling. Caution: Lentils can be difficult for diabetics to handle."
positive,29/8/20,"I cannot comment on price because this is not sold locally; however, I can comment on taste.  These are so simple to cook and healthy.  I found a really good lentil soup recipe to use these in."
negative,18/1/21,"i was a little disappointed,it does not taste like the eel i remembered.this is very muschi,i dont think i order it again.///karin"
positive,18/6/21,"I'm a pretty big coffee drinker, but had never tried Kona coffee before. I gotta say, Hawaii Roasters Kona Coffee was the best coffee I ever had. The type of coffee you want to savor for the flavor rather than gulp down for the caffeine (which is really hard to do because it tastes so good, after your first sip you just want to keep downing it rather than savor it). I purchased my first package right before the holidays and it was a total hit with my family and friends. I am now totally hooked and strongly recommend Hawaii Roasters Kona to all coffee lovers."
positive,18/6/21,"Love this coffee!  I've always enjoyed ""good"" coffee but this is great coffee. A friend sent it to me as a gift, and I'm so happy he turned me onto it.  The coffee is strong (the way I like it) and has a smooth, rich flavor. I know what I'll be buying for my friends this holiday."
positive,7/7/21,"This was a gift to our son-in-law and from what I understand, he really enjoyed it -- rich, full-bodied flavor."
positive,18/6/21,"Like most coffee drinkers, I know Kona is a special coffee bean, and this brand offers great taste. At my local coffee shop, I often pick Kona when it is offered as the flavor of the day. While the coffee shop Kona is better than an average coffee, it did not seem to be anything special, and I could guess they do not sell true Kona, but a blend.  So I decided to try a true 100% Kona and picked Hawaiian Roasters.  I am very happy with this purchase---might be the best coffee I have ever had.  The flavor is strong and there is no after-taste issue.  I picked the medium roast and I plan to try the dark roast next."
positive,7/7/21,"Planter's Big Nut bars are just that:  Big and full of nuts (honey roasted peanuts, almonds, and cashews)  I often have issues with this kind of snack, since they so often try to position themselves as a healthy choice and they so often are not one.  Aside from calling itself a granola bar, this snack does not make any particular health claims, yet it actually is a relatively good choice - VERY preferable to a candy bar (which is really where these types of snacks belong).  It contains 12 g of fat, but almost none of it (1.5 g) is saturated.  Each bar contains no cholesterol, a reasonable 230 mg of sodium, and 220 calories, while providing 7 g of protein, 3 g of fiber, calcium, iron, vitamin E, and phosphorous.  Like most of these bars, there's quite a lot of sugar, but again, when compared to other candy bars, it's not a bad choice, and they easily taste as good as most candy bars.  I wouldn't hesitate to have one of these as an occasional treat."
positive,1/7/21,"These bars are pretty tasty. As you might imagine, they are truly for ""nut lovers."" Fairly sweet with great nutty flavor. It's nice that they don't just use peanuts."
positive,7/7/21,"These are vaguely like a Payday, nuts stuck together with chewy sweet goodness, and something vaguely like Rice Crispies in there. They are saltier than I expected, though I like that. I'm not seeing a lot of nuts besides the peanuts, though. And there is more of the cereal stuff than I was expecting.<br /><br />I'm a big nut eater, so I do like these, and I like the salty sweet nutty sticky mess. But I think I'd prefer them w/o the cereal filler."
positive,23/7/21,"I was a little hesitant in trying these Triple Nut Bars since I'm not a big fan of almonds, however, I haven't found all that many almonds in them.  Plenty of honey roasted peanuts and quite a large amount of broken up cashews, I love these!  I eat them slowly to savor the flavor, because they really are good.<br /><br />These granola bars are a little larger in size than the standard, 4-1/2"" long by 1-1/14"" wide by 5/8"" thick.  Just salty enough to make them delicious, and sticky enough so it doesn't break apart when biting into one.  Yet not so sticky that you have to wash your hands after eating.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again."
positive,20/7/21,"These are a tasty treat but I would not eat one everyday. I like all nuts in bar - honey roasted peanuts, almonds and cashews. I like them separately but having them together blended really nicely, I was surprised!<br /><br />I was very impressed with the size of the bar. Compared to other bars they are a generous size. I think I will be buying them in the near future. Great taste and fair size.<br /><br />Update: March 2012, I liked these so much I bought more. They are not healthy for you but are very tasty. I try to eat one every few days."
positive,19/7/21,"I like how this bar taste, is soft not like other peanut bars that you are afraid that every single bite will hurt.<br />I like the flavor of the honey roasted peanuts, almonds and cashews combination.<br />This bar is delicious."
positive,18/6/21,"I am a long time diabetic and always looking for a sweet treat without all the sugar. I've always enjoyed Haribo gummies, so I tried their sugar free version and WOW. You can't tell the difference. They are still sweet and fruity and smell just the same. As a matter of fact, so good, me kids ate almost all them. Not many candies I enjoy that are sugar free, but these are the ticket."
positive,7/7/21,"I am loving this coconut oil.  It's a difficult thing to find in stores and I've been searching for a good alternative to cooking with olive oil since it has such a low smoke point.  All the other sites I found it was too expensive so I tried this and have replaced it 100% as my only cooking oil.  It's light and flavorful and has a lot of health benefits to go with it!"
positive,27/6/21,We buy this product to keep us healthier-it has a healing property of keeping bacteria at bay especially during the Winter months.
positive,21/7/21,"First I ordered a case of Loma Linda Vege-Burger.  It was disappointing--a whoooole case of disappointing.  I thought that my memories from youth of how good canned vegeburger had been must have been overblown.  Then I tried this Worthington Vegetarian Burger.  This is exactly what I remembered.  The big problem is I can't stop eating it.  I love eating it straight out of the can!  The texture is great, the flavor is great, it crumbles nicely--easy to use.  Calories are moderate as well.  Good imitation meats help me resist eating the real thing, and this product is perfect for me."
positive,18/6/21,"I use to grab my coffees at local stores, now do all my coffee shopping here, because of price and quanity, my wife loves the flavor of this coffee and swears by it. I bought the Kurig and have to say for time saving, and convience it's the best out there. It's also the only one that allows you to brew your on blends.<br />Also try Paul Newmans organic blend, that's my brew."
positive,7/7/21,"In my opinion, the DHA soymilks always taste the best and are the most creamy. Doesn't hurt that they are healthy, too! I usually drink Silk Brain & Bone health soymilk at home but was looking for smaller containers to bring to work. I tried the ZenSoy cappuccino flavor and was pleasantly surprised. It's very delicious and is a nice change from plain soymilk."
positive,30/6/21,I was weary of buy food through the mail. This was a great purchase. Great taste and great price. I will be looking for other great deals.
positive,1/7/21,"We're so happy we tried this.  If you love Red Lobster Biscuits these are the ticket.  I highly recommend this product. Wow... what a find! Yummy"
positive,24/8/21,"I am new to bread making and this was the third loaf of bread I made in my machine. Toasted with butter, this bread is superior to anything I've ever tasted. It is the reason I bought a bread making machine."
positive,21/7/21,"I have tried other brand of oils, but this is the best by far, as it makes the popcorn taste better and it is easy to use.  I always said popcorn will taste great with all the right ingredients."
positive,25/6/21,"So far this is the best affordable coffee we found in the US. Before we had ""Coffee Bean Direct Sumatra Mandheling, Whole Bean Coffee, 5-Pound Bag"" which we didn't like at all. But it still doesn't reach the coffee we had in Europe."
positive,13/9/21,"I do not drink much caffeine, so I need my spearmint leaves to be pure and not cut with other teas. This brand delivers. My first order was for 3 1# packages and I have just completed an order for 4 more. For those of you that want a good refreshing spearmint tea, I encourage you to give this brand a try."
positive,18/6/21,"Tasty stuff - no complaints, other than I wish you could pick amongst the 4 selections, and perhaps avoid the ""Peppered"" flavored one, in favor of a different one."
positive,7/7/21,"If you like Sriracha, this is definitely the cost effective way to order it!  With free shipping from Amazon prime, each of these 28 oz bottles actually costs a little less than the 17 oz bottles from the store!"
positive,15/7/21,"I purchased these cracker chips at Walmart twice and now I can't find them and they have no idea what I am talking about.  Love them and have some coupons, but can't find them now.  I will continure to look.  Trying to be healthy and these are great."
positive,11/7/21,This Cinnamone Hot Chocolate is the best. We get it every year around Christmas time and enjoy the holiday movies with a cup of this hot chocolate. You can not go wrong getting this hot chocolate.
positive,7/10/21,"I love this energy drink. I bought this drink because my old buddy told me about this mixed drink to make that tastes really really good. The drink is called the 'Panty dropper.' you mix 1/3 of this drink, 1/3 of Jager, 1/3 of Rated X Vodka. The drink tastes great and in no time at all you will find your self naked and panties dropped. Fast shipping with wonderful service. I look forward in doing business with them in the future. Thanks for your help."
positive,6/7/21,"This isn't as hot as some of the hot sauces I have tried. However, this one has the best taste for the scovel units. So this is the best bang for the heat and flavor combined. You will not find anything hotter with this kind of flavor. Great stuff."
positive,18/6/21,"I was purchasing nutritional yeast at Whole Foods, but the cost was too high.  Bob's Red Mill makes a great nutritional yeast and the price is right!"
positive,7/7/21,"This product does taste like sugar. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the price. It really is very expensive, so I keep trying other sugar substitutes to see if I could find a cheaper alternative. So far I haven't found anything that is close to this. There's no after taste, but start off using only a little because you might get stomach upset(diarrhea) then increase little by little so your system has time to get use to it."
positive,27/7/21,"I use this tea mostly for making large pitchers of iced tea.  Mix in a little mint and chamomile and you have a mocktail that can't be beat!"
positive,13/7/21,"This is the best black tea I've ever had that came out of a teabag.  It has a distinct and rich tangy flavor that is almost reminiscent of an expensive bourbon.  Most other brands seem highly unsatisfactory after getting used to this delicious tea, so I plan to keep some around all the time.  It's a little expensive but nowhere near as expensive as going to a cafe or tea house to get a great cup of tea."
positive,13/9/21,"I got this tea a few days ago and it has great taste...has a mild citrus taste. Love love love! Will come back in 4 weeks to review the weight loss aspect as today is my first day!<br /><br />Update (almost 2 weeks later): I am still totally in love with this tea and I actually noticed that it suppresses appetite. Great! I have been losing weight but I can't totally attribute it to this tea as I have also been exercising more. But the appetite suppression is a great attribute for me."
positive,7/9/21,"I just like the taste and the fact that it's green tea I haven't lost any weight but I love it just the same.  Sweet mild taste unlike regular green tea."
positive,17/4/21,This tea is absolutely amazing!  This tea is great tasting and I have noticed it has curbed my cravings and has killed my coffee cravings.  It provides the perfect pick me up without all the side effects of drinking coffee.  Definitely a keeper!
positive,10/3/21,Nice and easy to use. Perfect for making almond milk; the mesh is very fine so the milk comes out very smooth. I would highly recommend this product!!!
positive,17/4/21,"Both my husband and 3 year old have a gluten allergy. We have tried other products and found that these taste the best for animal crackers. It's not grainy or taste funny. Like another reviewer stated, it taste more like a butter cookie. Yummy! Not sure why anyone would rate it one star. I understand personal preference to taste and texture like one reviewer but the other reviewer just seemed to be on a rant. We have been pleased with this product and highly recommend it to others who are looking for a tasty gluten free snack."
positive,21/1/21,"Great item and great service. This gum is really hard to find in my area and it's a favorite of ours. We've ordered this a couple of times and I order this as soon as I run out and I'm always pleased.  Thanks"
positive,30/1/21,"This is my favorite flavor of microwave popcorn.  You don't get that creepy fake butter taste.  It tastes like the kind my dad made on the stove when I was a kid, with oil and salt."
positive,13/2/21,Great taste!  Different than any ice tea we have had!  Kids love it!  All natural sugar.  Will buy again
positive,15/1/21,"A very good tasting yogurt starter at a good price, that can be made without using any sugar.  Easy to use in conjunction with an electric yogurt maker."
positive,6/3/21,"This tea is really tasty and at a great price.I'll be ordering more,that's for sure.Since I really don't have anything else to say,but this stupid thing won't allow me just to keep it simple,I have to add words to make it over twenty.Hope you're not as irked by this as I am."
positive,8/6/21,"This coating has just enough seasoning to make fried chicken very tasty. The flavor doesn't overwhelm. It makes it easy to make fried chicken at home."
positive,7/1/21,"The Package arrived promptly and the chocolate brought a smile to my mother's face. Awesome chocolate and highly recommend it!"
positive,17/4/21,Bought this flavor for the first time I was very happy with the taste. I will be buying it again.
positive,10/3/21,"The dogs loved them, I'll certainly order these again.  They're wholesome and not made in China which is very important"
positive,14/1/21,"I was hesitant buying so much of this before I had even tasted it, but it has a great flavor, which is really all you can expect from an energy gel in my opinion.  I had previously only bought the orange flavor, so now I have a new flavor that I can depend on."
positive,24/5/21,"I've never needed to use these for energy as I never feel drained. But my brother recommended them, saying he takes one before and every half hour of his runs. I still haven't noticed a difference but when I start running over 14miles maybe I'll need it."
positive,14/10/21,"but i ran out and now i see that the price has increased from 81.00 to 131.00 while it is still i'm sure a good deal that's a sharp increase."
positive,7/2/21,"I just got my first case and let it get cold in the fridge for a couple days.  Drank my first bottle tonight and let me tell you, it tastes like.....WATER!  I didn't detect any dirty taste or even an aftertaste.  I don't understand what people are saying it tastes funky because all I drink is water and milk.  This tastes like my bottled regular water.  I'm going to switch to 2-3 bottles of BLK Water a day and see if it really makes me feel any better and energized."
positive,29/3/21,"Idk what everyone is freaking out about. It tastes like slightly salty smart water. The color is a little unnerving at first, looks like rust water. A  friend of (nutrition major) likes the idea of it so I can't be that bad...maybe"
positive,17/4/21,"Very tasty crackers (especially for GF). Not many crackers in the box but if you're buying GF products you probably already know that. My whole family likes them. I bought a couple of cases last time to save money on shipping. FYI... they make a great substitute for bread crumbs in meatloaf and parmasean chicken."
positive,10/3/21,"These vegetable flavored crackers are a pleasant surprise for those of us who are gluten sensitive.  They have an almost pizza-like fragrance and taste very nice indeed.<br />As a veteran of sampling rice crackers, cakes, etc., as well as crackers of other grains, I must say this Glutino texture is much preferable to the hard crackle rice flour gives to crackers and, too, the flavor is quite good.<br />I have subscribed to have them delivered as a result."
positive,10/7/21,This is our favorite jerk sauce and it was sent correctly and speedily by the merchyant so all is well.
positive,27/1/21,"I actually loved this flavor, I bought one of each of argo tea flavors from my local store; I liked this one the most.  Im not sure what kind of tastes the other two reviewers have, but im amazed that they hated it so much.  The mint and lime mix together wonderfully, it might even mix well with gin.  I noticed the mint flavor at first, followed by a tart lime flavor at the end.  I will be buying more.<br /><br />According to the bottle its made with ""Armeniam Mint tea,"" not black tea as one of the reviewers noted."
positive,1/6/21,"My sister was sick with terminal cancer and was suffering from a poor appetite. She had this juice in the hospital and liked it. It was not available for sale locally. I emailed Apple and Eve, and they very nicely responded that it was available from Amazon. I ordered it and it was delivered promptly to her house."
positive,20/8/21,This is a very good tasting salt especially on freshly popped popcorn.  I use it in everything. I no longer use the regular table salt becuase this just really enhances food without the metallic taste of table salt or the somtimes to salty taste table salt has.  You will think your food was prepared by a fine dine chef.  Buy a non-corrosive grinder to use this salt and you will never use table salt again.
positive,14/8/21,"Good overall oil for salads, cooking, etc., we have benn buying it from on Amazon for a couple of years now and are on auto ordering which is even a little cheaper making it a GREAT deal"
negative,21/4/21,"This oil tastes very bitter.  I ordered this because it had good reviews, so I don't know if it is old, bad, or in a contaminated tin."
positive,1/4/21,I LOVE THIS STUFF THE NEWER BOTTLES DONT LOOK LIKE THIS BUT ITS SO FILLING AND DELICIOUS.CARROT JUICE IS MY SUPER FOOD
positive,17/4/21,What more can you say than it tastes great. Amazon had a good deal on this when I ordered it over a year ago.
positive,10/3/21,"I have been using Walden Farms products since the company came to North America and they are a regular part of my shopping list. Their pancake syrup is thick and fantastic. This is so versatile and great on Salmon (maple glazed), chicken, turkey etc, in chili and stews instead of molasses, great in butternut/carrot/pumpkin pureed soups, in milkshakes, on toast (french toast, biscuits, bread puddings, or breakfast bakes, on eggs, pancakes, high-fiber cereal, in puddings, hot and cold cereals, desserts, ice cream souffles,and in steamed milk and hot coffee! This is great on waffles, or to bake with (great for cakes/muffins etc); I love pouring it on top of crumb cakes and letting it soak in. I especially love mixing it into Greek yogurt or cottage cheese. Adding it to pumpkin puree with some cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and sweetener makes it tastes like pumpkin pie in a bowl, but healthy. Great way to have flavor without the added sugar."
positive,22/4/21,This is such a good tasting syrup that when they stop selling it in the NC stores. I seek amazon and is very impressed with the price.
positive,25/4/21,"The first time I ate it, I didn't realize that the beans sunk to the very bottom, so when I was almost done all I had left were a bunch of beans.  From then on I made sure to stir it up occasionally and really enjoyed the mixture of vegetables."
positive,1/4/21,"When I decided to become veggie, my boyfriend frowned.  He figured that we'd be giving up on all these foods that he likes.  I made these sloppy joes for him though, and he couldn't even tell the difference!  We're talking about a guy who likens eating vegetables to having teeth pulled.  I figure that he if he can eat them and ask for them again, anybody would like them."
positive,30/6/21,"PRO:  THIS COFFEE IS GREAT IT IS ONE OF THE BETTER ONES I HAVE TRIED AND I HAVE TRIED OVER 35 BRANDS, OVERALL I WOULD give it a rating 2 from 1 to 10.<br />WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND.<br />CON: I FEEL IT IS A BIT PRICEY."
positive,1/3/21,"I liked the size of the Mini-Fingers Walker's Shortbread.  Though not more than one or two bites for each one,they'r mighty tasty!"
positive,29/1/21,"It's hard to describe this to people who have never sampled it, but basically it's a powder to which you mix milk and sugar to get a sweetened malted drink. It is supposed to promote sleep.<br /><br />Quite simply it's a comfort drink when plain milk just won't do. You can also call it malted milk or a hot sweet malt drink.<br /><br />In the great British trifecta of British powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar, Horlicks the most malty, Milo is medium chocolately and malty, and Ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately. It's actually named after the inventor, William Horlick.<br /><br />As far as taste goes, you can make it as malty or sweet as you like depending on how much of each you add to the milk. But to those who love and grew up on Holicks, it's just a great comfort drink."
positive,17/4/21,"This is a great tasting hot drink. It is not chocolate base like Milo or ovaltine. When added to milk the color of the milk barely changes. It gives the milk a smooth texture and a creamy taste. I mix 2 tbs with warm milk, sometimes I use sugar and sometime I don't. Without sugar added it still has a good taste. The only thing is the 300g container is very small I was expecting something a little bigger for $10. If I knew 300g was so small in size I would have order the larger size.<br /><br />Here is the Nutritional fact base on 1 serving 25g<br /><br />Calories 189<br />Sodium 1 mg<br />Total Fat 4 g<br />Potassium 0 mg<br />Saturated 3 g<br />Total Carbs 27 g<br />Polyunsaturated 0 g<br />Dietary Fiber 0 g<br />Monounsaturated 0 g<br />Sugars 19 g<br />Trans 0 g<br />Protein 10 g<br />Cholesterol 0 mg<br />Vitamin A 36%<br />Calcium 88%<br />Vitamin C 28%<br />Iron 19%"
positive,10/3/21,"This is a very welcome product.  It is so difficult today to find any candies that are made without GMO's.  Having said that I must also say that I was astounded at the price listed.  I purchased these candies in a local supermarket for $3 a bag.  That is THREE, not thirty [when you add shipping].  Unreal's website lists many stores that will soon be carrying these products.  They are great everyday type candies I would recommend to anyone but not at the price listed."
positive,30/5/21,"This is the best KCUP ever. It is fantastic... sweet. It doesn't have to much caffine but just enough. The flavor is fantastic. Great Price!"
positive,28/9/21,"These are by no means low-cal, but they have 20 g protein and taste really good, better than a lot of the vitamin-tasting bars I've had.  They are huge, so I half it and eat one half now and the other later on or another day.  I'm eager to try the triple chocolate flavor.  The sugar grams is 38 per bar...that's why I only eat half at a time.  Fiber is just 2 grams per bar."
positive,6/5/21,"I got these, and another brand at the same time. I far preferred the taste of this pouch than the other brand. My daughters love these snacks, and I love how easy they are to just grab when in a hurry. I'm also excited to pack them when we go on picnics. =) My 2-year-old, and my 10-month-old are able to slurp these up in just seconds, but they enjoy each and every second of it.<br /><br />I am curious though, if anyone knows.... Are these pouches BPA free? Everything else about them is so good, that I would hope they would be, but it doesn't say it anywhere on them. =( So, my assumption would be that they are not BPA free, otherwise that would be a high marketing point."
positive,20/4/21,"I love this water.  It's liquid gold.<br /><br />I bought ten cases a year ago and have been giving bottles of Trivedi Water as gifts to family and friends since then.  It makes a wonderful gift.<br />Each person has had their unique experience with it.<br /><br />I'm thrilled it's available on Amazon-now I can use it and share it more freely.<br /><br />I've used Trivedi Water on plants with great success.<br /><br />Most recently I started using it on my skin.  Wow.  It's clearing up acne and revitalizing my skin in a way I couldn't have imagined.<br />Truly amazing.<br /><br />And in terms of drinking Trivedi Water--the taste is indescribable. The closest I could say is that it tastes like pure water from a mountain stream--fresh, clear, and vital with a quality of softness to it.  It quenches some taste or thirst that is deeply satisfying.<br /><br />Try it."
positive,20/4/21,"I would like to share with you who are contemplating Mr. Trivedi's products, I was diagnosed with are rare form of acid reflux. I was advised not to drink anything carbonated and a whole list of no no,s.  About 3 months ago I found out about this incredible water, since then that is all I drink.  I had the most amazing results, not only easing my acid reflux,but also drinking the water brings a sense of calmness and almost at the same time a felling of complete happiness and tolerance of which I am not especially noted for.  At the 11-11-11 retreat one of the wonderful staff members remembered me from the center in Soho, she remarked how different and calmer I was compared to 2 months ago. I know there will always be skeptics, I am ready for them.<br /><br />Thank you, Mr. Trivedi"
positive,21/4/21,This water is the best tasting water I have ever had. I used it on a plant that had some leaves looking limp and now the plant looks like new. I notice an energy difference each time I drink some. Love it.
negative,2/5/21,"Based on the reviews, I ordered a 6 pack of these.  BAD IDEA.<br />We have tried a number of different varieties of pods,  these are by far the worst.<br />This stuff is so bad no one here will drink it.<br />You might want to buy one bag and try it before ordering a 6 pack."
positive,25/5/21,"These bars are very good for you with an awesome taste!! I love them, I try to eat one for breakfast every day and already have lost a little weight. I wouldn't recommend eating more than 1 per day because of the fiber, well you know!! But they are delicious!! Peanut Butter isn't my favorite flavor but is very good!! I love the caramel ones the best!"
positive,7/9/21,VERY! VERY! GOOD.  I BUY THEM BY THE CASE OF 24.  JUST BOUGHT SOME THIS MORNING.  FANTASTIC.  I AM ON WEIGHT WATCHERS AND I COUNT THEM AS ZERO POINTS.  FANTASTIC.
positive,25/5/21,"You don't have to use the ""beer can"" method.  This seasoning is great in many ways to cook chicken."
positive,22/5/21,"I love how these mints taste.  Compared to the classic Peppermint flavor ( which I used before ) they are a bit less strong and ""spicy"".  They taste very sweet and still give off a great minty scent.  And they don't get the horrible sour aftertaste that classic Altoids do.<br /><br />I love these mints."
positive,19/7/21,"The regular shirmp noddle soup's taste is very good, and this spicy srimp flavour has a better taste, I like it!"
positive,7/9/21,Very well balanced flavor with no after taste. Syrup does have the tendency to drip down the side while pouring so you may want to get a pump.
positive,25/8/21,"Amazing coconut flavor and very easy to make! This was the 5th flavor I've made and all came out better then expected."
positive,6/9/21,this product has a kick to it which you cant usually find<br />with other hot mustard brands but pay attention the jars are very small
positive,25/5/21,"I received these pistachios as a Christmas present. They are fantastic! I can't seem to stop eating them, and neither can anyone else in the family. My adult son had never tried pistachios before eating these, and now loves them, too. I will definitely be ordering more of these."
positive,7/9/21,"This is an amazing biscuit! My all time favorite!<br /><br />It's sweet, but not too sweet - that is the best part. Crunchy biscuits are grounded - and that is this product.<br />I like to have it with milk, or with juice.<br />It's very nutritious. Few spoons of ground plazma/lane biscuits, and a cup of milk make a very tasty breakfast.<br />We make sure that we always have few boxes of this biscuits in the home - everyone enjoys it, grownups and kids.<br /><br />To make delicious cake: add juice (orange or strawberry are my favorites) to lane biscuits, add little by little juice, so that you don't end up making it too liquidish; shape it as desired; add whip cream; and your cake is done!<br /><br />Plazma and Lane biscuits from Bambi company are the same biscuit - same cookies, same company is making them; just name of cookies is different."
negative,13/10/21,I purchased one bottle for 6.99. I wish I would have spent it on something else.<br />First the water looks disgustingly dirty and it has some weird taste to it.<br />Do not drink warm it will taste worse.  I will stick with regular faucet water.
positive,2/10/21,"this is quite possibly the greatest thing to make a sandwich with. buy it.you aren't watching your calories anyway. it's addicting with turkey!"
positive,23/9/21,"I bought this as a gift for my Sister. She loved it! Quality product that lasted her a while. With hints to do it again, I am sure I got my money's worth."
positive,26/6/21,"Absolutely the best waffles and pancakes.  Follow the direction exactly.  My whole family agrees that this is a super product...the kind they have at most hotels/motels that offer breakfast,,,,,make your own at the breakfast."
negative,25/5/21,"This waffle mix is so tasteless.  I'm shocked to hear this is the brand that is sold in some hotels. I would not recommend it to anybody."
positive,7/9/21,This stuff is awesome! I love the fact you can eat it right out of the pouch since it already has an amazing taste to it.
positive,15/7/21,"I got a sample of these in the mail and I tried them one night after ravaging my pantry for something crunchy and tasty. Boy, did these hit the spot they are so good they have now replaced my love for cheetos and jax. They are crunchy and cheesy and OMG they are just unbelieveably good and good for me too. What more could a girl ask for?"
positive,3/6/21,"Great tasting mild mustard. Is excellent on sandwiches. Don't buy if you like your mustard hot and spicy. Also its organic!"
positive,27/9/21,"We just love this mustard!  Excellent flavor!  Great deal on Amazon.  The subscribe and save plan from Amazon is great & you can cancel & change your plan anytime you want.  It is well worth it.  Organic!  Only one bad thing about it, it's in plastic.  If it was in glass (like Eden) then wooo weee!  Simply perfect!  I have a awesome recipe you can try out using this mustard.  I was thinking that a pack of 6 might seem like too much mustard for most.  But if you try this delicious recipe, you might find that 6 aren't enough!<br /><br />Roasted Potatoes Dijion<br /><br />1/2 C Dijion Mustard<br />1/2 C Olive Oil<br />3 Lbs Red Potatoes, Cut into 1 1/2"" pcs.<br />2 Med Red Onions, sliced (aprox. 1.5 C)<br />Chopped Parsely for garnish (if you don't have fresh parsely it rocks without it!)<br /><br />In a small bowl, combine mustard & oil.<br />In a large bowl, combine potatoes, onions, and the mustard mixture.  Toss to coat well.<br />Spread evenly on a baking sheet.<br />Bake at 400F for 45-50 min. or until potatoes are tender and crispy.<br />Garnish with chopped parsley.<br /><br />Yum!  Enjoy! :o)"
positive,19/6/21,"I've been using rendered duck fat from another company that's 4 times as expensive but not any better.  I use it to make a chicken liver pate that convinces even the best palletes that it's duck liver pate.  This is enough duck fat for about 1-2 pounds of raw livers (depending upon your fat tollerance).<br /><br />My secret pate recipe:<br /><br />5 ounces rendered duck fat<br />1 lb chicken livers<br />1 large shallot, peeled and coarsely chopped (2 1/2 tablespoons)<br />1 tsp herbs de Provence (rosemary, marjoram, thyme work well)<br />2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed through a press<br />1 tsp sea salt<br />1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper<br />1 tbs cognac or dry sherry<br />One loaf of 2""x2"" rye or pumpernickel bread (look for this at the deli counter)<br />Olive oil<br />Garlic salt<br />Pate: Fry the first six ingredients until the livers are cook thoroughly.  Allow mixture to cool slightly so you don't melt your food processor.  Add cooked mixture to food processer and blend away.  Adjust seasoning and add cognac.  Cool in refrigerator.<br />Bread: Heat oven to 400F.  Coat bread slices with olive oil and place in a single layer on a sheet pan.  Sprinkle with garlic salt.  These cook quickly so check them after 3 minutes.  You want a hard crouton-like doneness."

positive,7/9/21,"I've tried other nut butters in the past, but couldn't get past the grainy texture and the ho-hum taste. This one changed all that! I LOVE crunchy peanut butter, and this crunchy almond butter did not let me down. Very creamy texture (no graininess AT ALL)with a robust nutty flavor, with nice substantial almond pieces throughout. It works well in a dip I make, and is wonderful in sandwiches. It spreads easily and thankfully isn't separated with a layer of oil on top like other nut butters I've tried. This product will replace peanut better in my house! My favorite lunch is an almond butter and blackberry jam sandwich on pumpernickel bread...drool...."
positive,3/8/21,"my 9 yo daughter really loves this product. it's easy and quick to make, which makes it a convenient after school meal. it makes about 2 portions if you only eat noodles without adding chicken or tofu or veggies. but it's really tasty."
positive,5/9/21,"I think these are delicious. They taste like chocolate and are not too sweet. My boys love them with a cold glass of milk. We ordered them about a couple of months ago, and still have some, so you get plenty for your money. I would recommend them to a friend, and I'm planning on trying the cinnamon ones, too."
positive,25/5/21,"I can't go back to any other mashed potatoes after eating these!  I would honestly prefer these over real mashed potatoes.  They are so creamy and just seems to have a nice balance of everything that comes together to make a great texture and taste!  Had these for Thanksgiving dinner and several people wanted to know my recipe for the mashed potatoes. Ha!  Honest Earth can't be beat!"
positive,7/9/21,Pleasant fresh tasting coconut. Smells good when you open the bag and smells good a week later when I finish it.
positive,11/9/21,I am very happy to have found this product. It adds so much flavor to many dishes. i am very pleased with it.
positive,13/7/21,"The jerky has a plesant taste, not overly fishy. Some of the pieces were highly seasoned. Some of the pieces were signifigantly drier than others but overall I recommend the product."
positive,22/7/21,"this has a great taste, is good on mufins or toast, also great on vanilla ice cream. excellent! Will buy again"
positive,22/6/21,"I tried couple of green tea but I like this green tea very much, great taste sweet smell will order more soon :)"
positive,28/7/21,"I drink a lot of teas and tisanes so I like to try different kinds from time to time. I've been drinking this for a few weeks and it's fantastic. Even before I brewed this I knew it was going to be good just from the aroma. (Actually it would make a great potpourri on its own.) It brews up a nice deep color with a good flavor. I highly recommend this."
positive,13/10/21,A good for you whole grain that also tastes great!You can also grind the grain in a coffee or spice grinder for millet flour.
positive,19/2/21,Received package in a timely manner and in acceptable condition. The rice is excellent and offers a wonderful alternative to white rice.
positive,14/12/20,"Everyone likes Frooties. These are a bit harder than the others that I have bought, so be prepared to workout your jaws. With that said, I do not think they are stale or anything, just a bit tough on the bite."
positive,14/12/20,"We found this at PF Changs, and it tastes just as great as it did there. There are 16 bags per box as listed."
positive,19/2/21,"These are absolutely great freeze pops, especially if you like anything that's a little sour.  These are very unique and certainly worth trying."
positive,10/1/21,"My family likes sour items, so be forewarned it is definitely sour but the flavors are so very good! I have had other otter pops and as you suck on them the flavor gets sucked out and you are left with an unflavored chunk of ice but these are definitely not like that. Great product and the only way I can find them is here on Amazon because I am to isolated to find them in stores."
positive,26/3/21,Caused a fight over who was getting what lol. Perfect gift and have told many others to check out this box and the others they have available. Very quick delivery
positive,24/3/21,"I've been drinking peppermint tea for about 25 year. In fact my family used to grow and harvest peppermint tea from our own patch. To me, this tea tastes great, and has a good minty kick to it. I'd certainly purchase this again. I use a little mesh tea ball infuser and pack it full regardless of the size cup I use. At this moment I am drinking a 20oz cup and the strength is good. I declare this a phenomenal value!"
positive,24/2/21,"Although this is no substitute for the real thing, the flavor is good enough when you need a substitute."
positive,19/2/21,"These work great with s'mores - I was so shocked. They are a little thicker and not as cloyingly sweet as non gluten free grahams, but I found that refreshing. Because they are thicker, they stand up to smushing the marshmallow and chocolate in between each cracker better than regular grahams, which can fall apart. I'd highly recommend!"
positive,14/12/20,"I have not yet tried these crackers with s'mores, but they are very good with any kind of frosting, especially cream cheese frosting - a nice, quick treat that is gluten free."
positive,19/10/21,"Mmm...this boxed macaroni and cheese kit is great. The cheese sauce is smooth and creamy and there is just enough ro-tel included to give the mac some kick-without making it runny. As a bonus, it only takes about 15 mins. to prepare.<br /><br />Note: The ro-tel isn't mixed in with the cheese sauce, so you can add as much or as little of the tomato sauce as you'd like to the mac-or just skip it and use it in another dish. You could just add the tomato sauce to your portion if the kiddies don't like tomatoes. (Note: One box only makes 2 servings, unless you have tiny eaters).<br /><br />Try it!"
positive,18/5/21,"These are wonderful! They have a great, light sweetness and real chocolate flavor. Their consistency is that of hard candy (not like a melty chocolate), just what I wanted. I keep them in my bag and use them to stave off afternoon munchies. Great for diabetics and hypoglycemics."
positive,19/2/21,"I love Indian food, and this is a great way to get great-tasting Indian food quickly and easily. The Aloo Palak tastes amazing, and it is so easy to prepare, especially when I don't feel like cooking - just take the package out and heat it in the microwave. The pouches are usually good for two people, and taste great with rice. Also, the Aloo Palak is a tiny bit spicy, which I love but know some people can't handle."
positive,14/12/20,"I bought this for my girl friend that recently went through gastric bypass and she's a pretty picky person when it comes to food and surprisingly she loves the product and drinks like 2 shakes everyday!"
negative,1/6/21,"When I ordered, I did not realized this item was seasoned. It is & I don't like the taste. I wanted PLAIN organic mashed potatoes. I got 6 boxes of these. Be careful what you order in grocery."
positive,1/4/21,You have created a product which is low in fat and calories and high in taste.  Thank you for the bulk pack.
positive,15/4/21,I purchased this based on the hugely positive reviews and for the promise of having a tasty alternative to regular peanut butter.  I was amazed at how good it was!  Definitely buying this again.
positive,19/5/21,"I bought this product because I am on a medically supervised liquid diet. This product was recommended for adding low-calorie, low fat flavor to the shakes I am drinking. It is very tasty and adds great flavor. I have heard that you can add water and make a sort of peanut butter, but I have not tried that. I think it would also be excellent in baked goods too. This product also comes in a chocolate flavor, which is very good also."
positive,19/2/21,"I am kinda a noodle-bowl connoisseur. I've eaten lots of different ones at lunch over the years. The flavor of these bowls are noticeably better than other brands. Needless to say I am a big fan. The bowls have enough food to fill me up fine, but probably won't satisfy my husband. Also its not very spicy. I always end up adding a good amount of Sriracha. But that's just me. I recommend."
negative,14/12/20,"Strong aftertaste, and not a pleasant one.  Will try other powdered milk product. Did not order online, purchased from local grocery."
positive,28/7/21,"first let me state that I do not enjoy drinking soymilk.  I buy this for my son for traveling and out and about.  that being said, when I tasted this brand, it was actually good!  it has a nice sweet vanilla-y flavor without the almost bitter taste that most soymilk has."
positive,29/6/21,"This black walnut has excellent flavor.  My ice cream was wonderful. I was unable to locate this in any stores.  I also purchased the bourbon vanilla.  Waiting to try that.  The ingredients were simple... water, alcohol, black walnut."
positive,15/10/21,"I first purchased these at an area supermarket and fell in love with them right away.  Very pleasant taste and perfect blend of spices.  If you enjoy Cool Ranch Doritos, then I think you'll enjoy these chips.  I do not eat gluten free foods exclusively, however, these are the only chips I eat."
positive,20/7/21,"These chips are fantastic, they have just the right amount of spice and crispness.  These are probably my favorite chip on the market."
positive,12/10/21,"I use this as one of my herbal teas on the HCG protocol.  It's smooth and tastes good.  NO noticable side effects.  Would recommend.  I'v drank almost half the box now and I actually brew it in my coffee maker in the mornings.  Wonderful. Will repurchase.  Shipping fast and item as described"
positive,19/2/21,"This is great for graham cracker crust.  I made a cheesecake, and my gluten eating husband raved about it!  Can't wait to make another pie with it."
positive,14/12/20,"On a whim because I was out of salad dressing I decided to give this a try.  Being calorie free and sugar free I didn't hold much hope for this.  But I can say that it is incredible!!  I use it in tuna, on salads, salmon, and as a marinate with some balsamic vinegar. I love to really ""dress"" my salads, so now I can do it guilt free!"
positive,2/7/21,A bit pricey but has a Great taste. Love it in my tea and I use it in my deep conditioners for my hair.
positive,11/3/21,"I decided to try raw honey about a year ago and was a bit overwhelmed with all the choices. I ended up at my local health food store and found Stakich Raw Honey. It is produced about an hour from me, so given the speculation that raw honey from flora in your area helps with allergies, and liking to support local businesses, I decided to give it a try. I LOVE it. The taste is delicious and sweet. I've used it to replace all of our 'regular' honey uses, and no one in my family can tell the difference. The texture is definitely more grainy than processed honey, but that's to be expected. I mix a tablespoon of Stakich Raw Honey and a teaspoon of Stakich Bee Pollen into my Greek yogurt each morning and start my day with a nutritious and delicious breakfast. Try it, you won't be disappointed!"
positive,10/4/21,"These chips have so much Chile lime flavor it's amazing. Baked wheat does not have as many calories as regular chips and not greasy at all. I live in Hawaii and the stores do not stock them here so i have to order from amazon... Thank God for Amazon."
positive,22/7/19,"I grew up eating Red Vines and I liked them very much, but it's been ages and ages since I've eaten licorice. I don't why, I do eat candy on occasion, but licorice I just stopped eating, until last week when I tried these. They do kind of remind me of Red Vines. The flavor is different, of course, then I remember. These are pomegranate flavored, but it's been ages and ages plus years since I've eaten a pomegranate, so I can't swear that they've gotten the flavor right, but that being said, these are very tasty."
positive,2/2/20,"These naturally-flavored twists are healthier and tastier than the more popular type out there on the market (which taste like plastic)<br /><br />I was hoping not to find corn syrup in these twists, but these days it is almost impossible to find man-made snacks without it.<br /><br />Ingredients:  Organic wheat flour, organic sugar, CORN SYRUP, organic tapioca syrup, vegetable glycerin, sunflower oil, elderberry extract, citric acid, natural flavor, pomegranite juice concentrate, licorice root extract.<br /><br />Made in Mexico. (So much for being ""Newman's Own"")"
positive,2/2/20,"I really like this Licorice.<br /><br />It has a great flavor.<br /><br />Does it taste like Pomegranate?<br /><br />I don't really know what a pomegranate is supposed to taste like, so can't really answer if that's the flavor I'm tasting.<br /><br />But if you're looking for a licorice with a nice berry flavor that doesn't turn your tongue colors, this is it.<br /><br />I also like that it's from Newman's Own.  I always purchase their products as I know it's going towards charity."
positive,31/8/19,"I have never tried the similar candies before so maybe I have nothing to compare these with, but I really enjoyed them. It is not too sweet and just has a pleasant taste overall.<br /><br />I think I will be buying these candies for myself in the future. I tried Newman's Own other products and I am happy that this one has not dissappointed me."
positive,22/7/19,This licorice is addictive!  The taste is original and fresh.  What I love the best is the after taste-it leaves you wanting more!<br /><br />A Winner!
positive,12/1/20,"I am already a fan of Newman's Own Organics line of products.  I think they are generally high quality, reasonably priced and have a great track record as a charitable organization.  So, I was really looking forward to trying out the Pomegranate Licorice.<br /><br />When you first open the package, you can immediately smell the sweet sugary fruit scent of pomegranate.  The next thing you notice is the rich red, well pomegranate, color.  One thing I liked right off the bat is that the licorice sticks are not super long like a Twizzler.  They are shorter and more manageable to eat.  They are a also not overly sticky and do not leave a sticky residue on your fingers.<br /><br />Taste wise, they are great.  Perhaps my favorite aspect of this licorice is that they are not super sweet.  While they have a strong sugary smell, they are not obnoxiously sweet like Twizzlers.  The licorice has a nice chewy texture and trends towards soft.  The pomegranate taste is subtle.  At first you cannot taste it at all, instead tasting the sugar and gelatin flavors.  As you chew the pomegranate taste grows and by the end has a nice strong flavor.  The pomegranate flavor is also very good.  I haven't ate too many raw pomegranates but I do like the POM juice products.  This licorice compares well against the POM juice products.<br /><br />So, as a nice treat to share with the family, I highly recommend."
positive,19/2/20,"I'd been reading about this product in magazines for almost a year, and couldn't wait to try it. I finally got to and it did not disappoint. Pomegranate is not an easy flavor to capture and somehow they were able to. I have tried all the NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANICS licorices and this was the hardest in terms of chewing, but it was not overly hard. I have had some that I know would put any dental work at risk, and this is a good option if you like slighly harder licorice but still want something that is chewy. Not too sweet, but good if you need a candy fix. And of course, it's got all natural ingredients, so you can get your candy fix as I have been doing without feeling in the least bit guilty!"
positive,27/11/19,"Newman's Own Organics Licorice Twists have a lot of things going for them - 70 percent organic, with no artificial ingredients.  The pomegranate flavor was surprisingly good and, while it had a different consistency from the Twizzlers I'm used to, it wasn't a bad change.  Recommended."
positive,12/12/19,"Well, ""licorice"" is a stretch, but this is like most of the Newman products -- tasty and good quality. Whether YOU like the taste is, of course up to you, but I did."
positive,26/9/20,This licorice has a very good flavor! The only thing I would have liked is it were a little softer.
positive,22/7/19,"We enjoyed our package of pomegranate licorice.  I prefer to buy organic and this fits the bill.  It's not too sweet but yet still is candy.  The entire family enjoyed it and it was a nice special treat.  If you are looking for a nice treat that is not too sweet and sugary this works.  I would prefer that they didn't use corn syrup but it is candy."
positive,2/2/20,My husband loves his Florida Orange Blossom honey. He was delighted when I found it through Amazon. Now he does not have to wait for  care packages from his brother who lives in Orlando.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Real Florida Orange Blossom Honey<br />Price<br />Quick shipping<br /><br />Cons: None
positive,23/5/20,"This can be mixed with virtually any wine. I've had it mixed with champagne, Riesling, and Moscato, and it works well with them all. The price is rather steep, as I paid $7-$8 at a local gift shop."
positive,22/11/20,"I have to quit drinking coffee as I have horrible caffiene reactions. I love the taste of coffee though. I've tried hazelnut and mocha so far and both are tasty. Hazelnut has a bit stronger flavor but mocha is good too. Even my kids liked it when they tasted it. I think its a great alternative and better for you."
positive,30/3/20,"I love this stuff.  You can make it with milk or almond milk and put some whipped cream on top, it's amazing.  You can also blend it with ice to get a frap style drink."
positive,8/7/20,"Great taste and texture, especially considering it's sugar-free. 1oz is a perfect size to have it finished in on seating."
positive,4/1/20,"I switched to green tea several years ago after reading about the health benefits of green tea vs. regular brewed tea.  After trying many different brands, I settled on Celestial Seasonings Green Tea because of its rich tea flavor.  Finding it on Amazon was a plus, I now have it on auto ship and never run out of tea."
positive,30/1/21,My son gobbled this down right away.  I was looking for different flavors since they only hold so many in the stores.  Texture is fine.  What else can I say?  Tastes good to me too!
positive,2/11/20,"This is a great tasting product. It doesn't have any sugar. It flows just like honey!"
positive,17/10/20,"These pepper flakes have a rich, slightly acidic flavor and not a lot of heat.  They have a slightly moist consistency -- not sure if that will affect shelf-life.  Shipping was fast, but overly expensive."
positive,22/7/19,These are the best tasting of the Crown Prince offerings for Sardines in Olive Oil.
positive,2/2/20,"I Love them, and cant find them in stores around here.  So was happy to find them on Amazon. Better than just a salad topper! I crush them and add the to rice for flavor. Plus use them as a crumb topping on many dishes."
positive,4/10/20,"This mint is very minty.  It has a stronger mint flavor than the one with sugar.  Only problem, it isn't carried by my local stores."
positive,1/4/20,"The molasses dominates the mix, and the chipotle doesn't assert itself as much as I would have liked, but all in all it is a passable barbecue sauce.  It goes especially well mixed into a pot of baked beans."
positive,8/5/20,This tea has a wonderful flavor!! The price is right. And I love that they dont use staples on the bags. i can just throw the used ones right into the compost pit. Jasmine and green tea were meant to be together.
positive,18/6/20,"I actually have tried four flavors (to date) of the Di Vinci syrups.  I like them all.  I use them in baking (you can find some recipes on the internet for using these syrups in things like muffins, etc).  Be aware that these syrups are made with Splenda.  We love Splenda - use it everyday, so we're ok with it.  (Some folks have a problem with it, though).  Currently, in my pantry, I have strawberry (I suggest using this over some low-fat frozen yogurt or ice cream!) vanilla, peanut butter and pancake syrup.  All four taste great!  The consistency of the pancake syrup is thinner than you might want, however.  I bought it because my local store did not have syrup made with Splenda at the time.  (Now they do, though).  The price listed here is good.  I've paid $17 per bottle at an online retailer!!"
negative,20/8/20,"First, I would like to say that I purchased this product from the STORE, not from this seller. Also that there was not a problem with the expiration date of the coffee.<br /><br />I am not a picky coffee drinker. I like all kinds, but I prefer stronger brews. I like flavored coffee as well, but only when it tastes like what it is suppose to. I don't think anyone wants to drink chemical flavored coffee.<br /><br /> When I bought this product I thought it was going to be great, I am a consumer of folgers and have tried different flavors of theirs, however this was the first k-cup brand I bought from them and was VERY disappointed.  The coffee is definitely flavored and does taste like caramel, but after each sip there is an after taste of some sort of chemical.  The after taste is so strong and disgusting that you can neither enjoy the flavor of the coffee nor the caramel. For the first time was unable to finish my cup of coffee. To drink the entire cup would have been the equivalent of torturing myself.<br /><br />I would not recommend anyone buy this product."
positive,1/6/21,I stopped in the Cayman Islands and fell in love with this rum cake. It makes a great gift too.
positive,4/7/21,Tasty moist not too sweet just perfect. It its true rumcake. The taste of rum is minimul however it is there just enough.
positive,5/2/20,"I'm French and moved to USA in 2000. I miss many of the good foods I have in France. The Ricola herbal tea is one of them. I'm glad to discover recently that Amazon sells it. It might be the only place in USA that sells it.<br />It is calming, soothing and taste good.<br />It is good when you are thirsty right before going to bed, when you are sick and when you have a throat ache."
positive,22/7/19,"I don't generally care too much for the healthy alternatives, especially when it comes to coffee. However, after trying Truvia at a hotel, I am now hooked. I usually get it at the grocery store, but it is good to see that it is available on Amazon, and now that I have Prime, I might just be getting it online instead.<br /><br />This sweetener tastes really good, and in addition to coffee, I have had it with desserts and it tastes great. I think it even tastes better than sugar, and definitely tastes better than splenda.<br /><br />I cannot comment as to the health aspects related to artificial sweeteners, but I'm sure that there is plenty of information available on the Internet related to that.<br /><br />As a casual coffee drinker, I highly recommend Truvia! - However, definitely try out a sample before purchasing such a large box!"
positive,2/2/20,"These are fantastic! I've gone through about 20 bags in the last couple months.  Try putting out a bowl of these rather than pretzels or chips.  They've got a hint of saltiness to them so they go great with beer.  The bulk box of 15 bags is also the most economical purchase I've found."
positive,22/11/20,"Didn't know what to expect when I ordered this product.  But was pleasantly surprised about how good it is and the value.  Definitely will buy again."
positive,1/3/20,"Finally I found a whole bag of ONLY GRAPE Jolly Ranchers!  They are delicious and have been rather popular in my candy jar in my office (lots of thieving coworkers). $36 for 160 or these and 160 Cherry was a bit steep, but I think I'm ahead in the end for not throwing away all the undesired flavors in the multi-flavor bags."
positive,23/11/20,"I bought these for my husband. It's almost impossible to find sugarless black licorice in stores, & he's thrilled with these! Fast shipping, highly recommend."
positive,5/4/21,"Although it's low acid, it's still good tasting and it does not cause me Heartburn. I no longer have to take Prilosec daily. I would definitely order some more of this coffee. I receommend it to fellow Heartburn sufferrers."
positive,27/4/20,I like the coconut oil very much.  It taste good. I add it to my food everyday. Will buy again
positive,8/3/21,"I couldn't be happier! I was worried the expiration date would be a problem - nope! March of 2012. I was worried the milk would taste funny - nope! It's the best milk I've ever had!! Thanks for offering this at a great price!!"
positive,30/1/20,"Great product.  Easy to have on hand.  My 2 year old thinks it's fun to have a ""Milk Box""."
positive,22/7/19,Love the fact that I finally found organic sunflower seeds. I toast them with just a hint of sea salt.
positive,2/2/20,"For a low gluten product this stuff is very good.  It holds up well in liquid, doesn't get all mushy. I like the bits of dried fruit.  I add stevia for sweetness."
positive,2/9/20,"great jam...spicey,crisp just a little sweet.<br />maybe not the best for breakfast but perfect<br />for afternoon tea."
positive,26/1/21,"Simply put, this tea is delicious.  The mango taste is smooth and not overwhelming and all the ingredients are blended well so nothing is overpowering.  I also like the fact that Numi did not pump tons of sugar into the tea to make it overly sweet, thereby cutting down on calories, carbs, and sugar.  As the label indicates, this is 'barely sweetened' but it tastes just right.  There are also little 'gems' of wisdom underneath the bottle caps.  I can't wait to try every flavor in this line of Puerh teas in the glass bottle.  I did not order the tea through Amazon, rather I got it directly through the Numi tea website, but wanted to give a review here for others."
positive,9/1/21,These taste great.  I add 1 or 2 cubes to the water when cooking quinoa or lentils and it really adds a nice depth of flavor.  I use them often.
positive,30/7/21,"These pancakes get my highest rating for gluten-free pancakes! They taste almost identical to bisquick pancakes. They are SO yummy!! I'll never make GF pancakes from scratch again!"
positive,30/10/20,"I started drinking the blueberry hibiscus tea because I read that hibiscus helps to reduce blood pressure. I have never been a hot tea drinker until about a month ago. It did take me a few cups to get used to the taste. Now, I really enjoy the taste. I even miss it when I skip my nightly cup. I find it also relaxes me before bed. It is sweet enough that there is no need to add honey or other sweetener. The blueberry is an added bonus! I am willing to pay the steep price because I am trying to find something beside prescription medication to help control my out-of-control blood pressure. The price on Amazon is a bit higher than at Whole Foods where I shop."
positive,3/8/20,"In the great trifecta of British powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar, Horlicks the most malty, Milo is medium chocolately and malty, and Ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately.<br /><br />All 3 are basically comfort drinks when plain milk just won't do. All 3 are powders to which you add milk and sugar to get a sweet malty drink, the latter two with chocolate flavor as well.<br /><br />I love all 3 drinks. But if you are drinking this for nostalgia's sake, make sure you get the Milo from where ever your nostalgia springs from because Milo is made in different countries and they all taste a little different. For me, I love Milo for it's good mix of chocolate and malt, not too much of either, and a great comfort drink for cold nights."
positive,29/1/21,"Not the sweetest chickpeas I've ever had, but close enough. Nice flavor and texture, very fresh, no old beans. Cooked up great. Very pleased."
positive,24/10/21,"Reese's Sugar-free Peanut Butter Cups taste just like the regular ones. Plus they are lower in sugars and are healthier.  Great prices on Amazon too."
positive,24/10/21,My daughter really likes 5th Ave candy bars and they are hard to find in our area. Amazon  has them and they came quickly.<br />Thanks for the good service.
positive,16/10/21,"This was one of the first K cup boxes I bought, was not disappointed. It tastes great, like coffee is supposed to. Not too strong, not too weak...great flavor. Will be buying more."
positive,24/10/21,very cool and smooth tasting. the kind of snack that works any time and place. right on time and very affordable. i enjoy this a great deal.
positive,25/9/21,This a delicious Grape Juice.It is good for anytime of the day and it is healthy for you and your children. I highly recommend this for all kids and adults.Please try this out.
positive,19/10/21,"I really enjoy these bars, I usually will have 1/4 to 1/2 of bar at a time, gives me energy until next meal, love the taste and crunch.  :)"
positive,20/10/21,"Interesting concept! Very tasty too, I used the chocolate PB2 in my vanilla ice cream and it was a lean alternative to flavored syrups. I purchased these products to cut down on the fat from regular peanut butter. I would order it again although it is a bit pricey."
positive,19/10/21,"First of all, I just want to say that I hate lollipops. And I do mean HATE. Even dumdums seem to taste really artificial and just like colored sugar. I got these originally because I was intrigued by the organic label. I love that you can actually understand what's in these items and they have a video showing it being made. Great unique taste as well. Definitely well worth the price! My family and friends love it. The assortment is great and they actually taste like different things rather than a lot of candy that's out there."
positive,15/6/21,I bought this to share with my co-workers and in one week they are gone.
positive,4/8/21,"These lollipops are a wonderfully healthy option over regular store brand suckers/lollipops.  My children and I are very happy with the taste of these.  The flavors we have tried so far are tasty and strong, and the size is perfect for a special treat.  The 5 pound bag should last us a very long time."
positive,4/8/21,"These are the best lollipops I've ever had!  Sadly, they are not available via Amazon directly at the moment, so no ""guaranteed"" flavor ratios.  The bag I got was:<br /><br />65 Strawberry Smash<br />60 Tart Sour Apple<br />39 Googly Grape<br />35 Tooberry Blueberry<br />33 Wet-faced Watermelon<br />32 Mango Tango<br />30 Pomegranate Pucker<br />28 Very Very Cherry<br />1 Mango (no Tango; was only one of the colors ;) ...)<br /><br />So, a total of 323, pretty close to ""as advertised"".  I was surprisingly fond of flavors such as the strawberry and watermelon, which I generally don't like in other candies (artificially flavored ones).  However, the blueberry and mango fell a bit flat.  In general, though, these are the best approximations to real fruit flavors I've come across in hard candy before.  Hope the trick-or-treaters enjoy them as well!"
positive,18/7/21,a great little candy - tastes good - really fruity and not too sugary! my 2 yo son loves them (allergic to wheat and dairy)
positive,18/10/21,I purchased these as a nice treat for our 4 children. I try not to buy foods with artificial colors or flavors so when I saw these we tried them. All the kids and adults like them. I will certainly buy them again.
positive,15/6/21,"My kids love these, and like a lot of reviewers have said, they don't have corn syrup or chemical artificial sweeteners in them. It's still candy, but treat wise.. it's a treat I don't mind my kids having in moderation."
positive,4/8/21,"I just finished brewing a container of this tea to keep in the fridge.  I pre-sweetened it with some simple syrup, making it less sweet than most restaurants serve it as I don't care for super sweet tea.  I'm not a connoisseur but this tastes very similar to the teas I have had in restaurants.  I do wish there was no artificial food coloring (yellow)."
positive,8/6/21,"If you like the Ceylon tea variety, you will certainly enjoy and appreciate this tea.<br /><br />In the 20+ years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed. The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years.<br /><br />Have always used loose tea, but this time wanted to try their teabags (because of the convenience/portability) and to see if the bagged tea would brew as clear as the loose tea, and I am happy to report that it actually does.<br /><br />I am so glad to find Ahmad teas available here because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away. The current Prime deal for the pack of 6 is superb (much cheaper than I can find locally). I'm taking advantage of the Subscribe and Save offer.<br /><br />The six tea boxes arrived nicely packed (see the photos I uploaded).<br /><br />Each box has a packing date (08/2011) and a best before date (08/2014).<br /><br />This is a great tasting tea, which I am happy to recommend."
positive,15/6/21,"I've been eating Boboli for years.<br />What can I say?<br />It's really the perfect pizza crust.<br />Not too fluffy, not too flat.<br />Great taste, great price.<br />I like this much better than the ""crust in a can"" varieties.<br />Boboli's been around for years now for a very good reason...they gave us a great product that has withstood the test of time and at a reasonable price to boot.<br />I usually brush mine with melted butter with a hint of garlic for added tastiness.<br />Pile on the Boboli sauce, a ton of cheese and your favorite toppings and you have a home run for the whole family.<br />Highest recommendations."
positive,4/8/21,"My sister and I both loved the taste of this caramel. 5* taste, and very sticky also! Both of us ordered more. Hardest problem is not eating the whole bag contents at one time."
positive,25/9/21,"These are tasty but really sweet.  I didn't notice they made my blood sugar stable any longer than any other bar.  I might buy them again if the price was right."
positive,19/10/21,"Tasty coffee.  Works well in drip coffee maker.  Smooth taste and nice flavor.  Remember it's preground, so don't expect fresh ground, recently roasted bean taste.  But it's a lot more convenient."
positive,4/9/21,"I just made myself a cup of this coffee and I think I found a new favorite brand. When I opened the bag I noticed the pleasant vanilla aroma which wasn't too sweet and overpowering like other brands. I used my french press to brew the coffee which I wouldn't recommend. The grounds are extra fine and the filter doesn't completely seperate the liquid from the grounds. I mixed the finished cup of coffee with some milk and it tasted just like flavored vanilla coffee but without the syrup or sugar. I really liked the taste it was mild but without any traces of bitterness. Definitely a good alternative to my usual starbucks coffee."
positive,31/8/21,easy to use  and nice tast u can add ice cream it will be great taste .
positive,9/10/21,"I have tried a number of Senseo pods, and this is my favorite.  It is very smooth.  It tastes like coffee from a coffee house (rather than a Senseo)."
positive,15/6/21,"With it's own typical strong taste..<br />Like Taster's Choice also but this one surely tastes better..<br />With little quantity you can make it taste from mild to strong.."
positive,4/8/21,"This was a great product and easy to use, I am now to fonadant decorating and it was tricky to learn how to get it on the cake, but after the second attempt I got it and it was amazing and it did have a nice sweet taste and was easy enough for a beginner to use. Everyone loved the cake that I made."
positive,15/6/21,"These are very tasty, and you can find these udon noodles at most stores. I really like the flavoring and this is my favorite flavor."
positive,4/8/21,"I've been eating this stuff for years--it was super simple to prepare as a college student (and has a long shelf life).  Now as a mother, my 3-year-old son loves it, and he's usually picky (note that my son only eats the ""mild"" version of this sauce).  I mix it with steamed white rice or steamed quinoa.  Both ways are fab, but of course it's healthier with quinoa.  It's cheaper at the local Asian market--but if you don't have those nearby, I guess this is the next best place to stock up."
positive,15/6/21,"We really like this peanut butter. The taste is great as my kids do not eat the completely natural peanut butter with only peanuts and salt. I don't care for it much either. This is a nice in-between that I feel is pretty healthy. We get this auto-shipped by Amazon for convenience and price. We go through a lot of PBJs for 3 kids' school lunches and I eat quite a few of them too!"
positive,4/8/21,"I have very picky eaters in my house and this peanut butter is really great tasting and healthier too!  After learning about transfats and really fealing guilty giving my kids PB&J sandwiches in their lunch with not so healthy peanut butter, I decided to try this one and really love it.  Thanks Skippy!  You did it right."
positive,1/10/21,"Because my job involves talking all day, and I am constantly surrounded by allergins, I go through cough drops like mad. The way I see it, if you are going to consume something, you might as well enjoy it. Ambrosoli-HoneeEnergy Plus more than fills the bill. I found it to be very soothing, but also had a strong honey flavor that I absolutely LOVED!<br /><br />The very best review I can offer for this product: I am about to order it again, and will be back for more."
positive,1/7/18,"I got them in a clear plastic bag, but how do you think they look before they are packaged?  They were fresh and salty.  yummy"
positive,10/8/18,"I like these little cheese chips. They satisfy my craving for something crunchy. And who doesn't like that last little bit of crispy cheese from your toasted cheese sandwich. That's what these are like. Just beware - I didn't notice right away that one bag held four servings, not just one. They are pretty rich so it would be hard to eat the whole bag, but I could see munching on half of the bag, which would be 150 calories."
positive,1/7/18,I was skeptical of buying this soup at first but it by far surpassed my expectations. It tastes soooo good!
positive,10/8/18,I had been drinking other mineral waters so far and I did not know how the taste of the mineral water is different from each other until I tried this water. Now I am really satisfied with the pure and good taste of this water and I will keep drinking the water. I would like to recommend this strongly.
positive,13/9/18,When summer comes I am constantly drinking ice tea.  Last summer I was told to stay away from caffeinated beverages.  What was I going to do without my ice tea?  I looked in Amazon.com and WOW!  Amazon had Lipton Tea Bags and they were DECAFFEINATED!  I was saved!!!!  I ordered some and I have been enjoying my ice tea ever since.
positive,17/7/18,"Love this product. Do not like ""diet"" drinks but this one is very good without the after taste that aspartame leaves. I add more water then the directions give and like it better this way."
positive,16/1/19,"Great tea.  Wonderful, mellow flavor.  You won't regret buying this tea.  Fantastic buy!"
positive,16/1/18,"This is the best nuocmam ever.  Smooth and extremely tasty.  Perfect on seafood, rice, whatever... Highly recommended - adds an amazing dimension to anything you use it on."
positive,16/1/19,"This tea will be a staple in my cabinet.  I heard about it by word of mouth, and the reviews weren't exaggerating-- it's great!  I love the smell."
positive,1/8/20,"While I don't like this as well as Rose's Lime Marmalade, and can't help wondering why the ""Lemon Lime"" actually looks greener than the straight ""Lime,"" it still makes a tasty spread."
positive,1/7/18,Great gluten free licorice treats but must be eaten fresh otherwise they get stale fast.
positive,10/8/18,I got a snow cone maker for christmas and was psyched!!!  I tried a cone with orange soda and was disgusted with the result but finally i tried these flavors... THEY ARE AMAZING!!!  Blue raspberry was by far the best with grape being the second best!  I RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERY ONE!!! IT IS SOOOOOOOOO GOOD!
positive,15/2/20,"I have used this chocolate drink previously and I love the cocoa flavor that it has and it does suppress my appetite while providing a little boost of energy. It does give you a huge jolt, which is great because by the end of the day I am able to get a good night's sleep.<br />If hot chocolate is a thumbs up to you then you will love this drink plus its benefits."
positive,22/4/21,"If you enjoy a bowl of ramen noodle soup, but are looking for something healthier, this is for you.<br />I just whipped up some of this with tofu and veggies yeterday. Just make sure not to overcook it, because it'll be less tasty."
positive,25/9/20,"That's what I thought when I took the first bite. I found these on an Amazon Manager's Special, for slightly less than $2/box and the ingredients were healthy and intriguing - with the 5 seed combination, and two of my favorites - rosemary and garlic. Since there were no reviews, I didn't really know what to expect, but I had to give these a try.<br /><br />First of all, they are very fresh & crunchy. The ""sell by"" date is 11/02/09 - 2 months away. They're cute, little, 1.5"" round ""crackers"", really tortilla chips. As a tortilla chip, these are the best I've ever had. They are very sturdy, you could use them to scoop anything, including the thickest guacamole, and I don't think they would break or crumble. The delicious taste I got from the first one with all of the nuances of every flavor, unfortunately diminishes, where the rosemary and garlic isn't really discernible, but you still get that wonderful corn (organic!) & seeds flavor with just the right amount of salt - way lower than most with 50mg. I don't know if that is considered a low sodium product, but many snacks and processed foods, like most jerky and a lot of crackers are way too salty for me.<br /><br />FYI Nutrition info:<br />Serving Size 1oz / about 16 crackers (28g) - 4 servings/box<br />Calories 140<br />Total Fat 7g - Saturated Fat 1g - No Trans Fat<br />Cholesterol 0<br />Total Carbs 18g<br />Fiber 2g<br />Sugars 0<br />Protein 2g<br />Sodium 50g<br /><br />BTW, they are gluten free, which is really important for a lot of people.<br />Most of the crackers in the box I opened were intact with a few broken ones mostly at the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />Even though they are perfect on their own, they would be really good with a black bean dip, guacamole or hummus.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you're looking for a tasty and healthy snack cracker/chip, these are for you!"
positive,16/11/19,I orderd a case when the last grocery store I knew about quit carrying the product.  It is a very good olive spread.  Makes a very tasty and reasonable calorie snack.  However two of the six jars had leaked and the lids were not sucked in.  I called the company and they credited my account immediately.  They get an A for customer service.
positive,9/9/20,"Gave only 4 starts because recently Amazon sent me a batch that was tough and hard to chew into. But the product itself is great if shipped fresh. The fresh ones last for a couple of months.  But if you get a hard batch, recommend getting replacements because they are really hard to bite into and sometimes I feel like my teeth may fall out trying to rip into the hard pieces."
positive,1/7/18,"Iv been eating fruit leather for over 10 years.  This is my favorite flavor.  Buying in bulk is the way to go, and they are very reasonable here."
positive,10/8/18,"These are a tasty item, and a great value.  I would say they are becoming a staple at our household. I wish the raspberry flavor was a bit more pronounced, but they are very fruity (not artificial) tasting.  Nice, short ingredient list, too!"
negative,15/1/20,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00164V0VW"">Kraft Italian Salad Dressing, Fat Free, 1.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 60)</a><br /><br />Big mistake, I am stuck with 59 packets of these horrible tasting salad dressings.  Kraft has a decent rep when it comes to items like this but they really missed the mark when they produced this item.  Horrible very salty taste perhaps because it is lite dressing, although I have tried other Kraft lite salad dressings and they were not bad. Does anyone want to buy 59 packets of italian dressing?  I will more then likely wind up throwing these out unless someone in my family decides to try them and likes them."
positive,1/9/20,"These sugar-free Russell Stover Cinnamon Bun Snack Bars didn't last long here!  If I had not known they were sugar-free, I'd never have guessed it.  The bars have a good cinnamon taste to them with some crunch and also are a bit chewy, which I like.  They do taste like a cinnamon bun in bar form and are a good size for a snack.  The bottom is covered with chocolate and finishes off the bar so that it tastes more like a candy bar than a sugar-free snack bar. Each bar has only 100 calories.<br /><br />Russell Stover makes several other kinds of snack bars and food items that are sugar free, and I intend to sample a lot more of them.  Highly recommend!"
positive,22/7/21,"We've tried several different brands of couscous.  This is our favorite.  It's a healthy choice that tastes great!"
positive,1/7/18,I purchased this product because I like to have a little protein in me before my morning walk. It is delicious.
positive,10/8/18,"I do not like protein at all. Not protein bars, not protein in my shakes, I just don't like the taste. These bars taste great. I was hesistant to get them because I was afraid they would taste like the protein I hate. BUT, they are great. I like these better than the cereal bars."
positive,14/5/21,"So far, the best decaf coffee I have tasted. Just leaves me wondering why no local grocery store carries it."
positive,17/10/19,"This pasta is truly one of the best organic whole wheat pastas out there. It does not taste as heavy or fibery as the other brands... it comes as close to ""white"" pasta as you can get. I second the other reviewer who warns not to overcook it, as it easily falls apart."
negative,3/10/21,I bought this product because I knew I liked sumatran coffee . Im new to roasting coffee but I roasted these beans many different degrees and cant get much flavor out of them. I sorry I bought 5# and will probably throw 4# away.
positive,15/9/20,"If you like black tea, this is excellent.  I bought it because I tried it at Bigby coffee and loved it.  It is worth the price."
positive,30/8/20,THE PEANUT BUTTER COOKIE IS EXCELENT IN TASTE JUST ABOUT THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF THINGS ADDED TO GIVE IT THE PROPER TASTE -- NOT TOO STRONG BUT JUST RIGHT.
positive,1/7/18,Good flavor and a great carob.  I like that extra nutrients are saved from it being raw.  Nice size bag as well.
positive,10/8/18,"Use it in casseroles, stews, soups and rubs for your meat.  Use it everywhere except your coffee.  So glad I bought it.  It's fantastic."
positive,5/12/19,"Checked reviews about several Companies this one had great ones. Purchased as a gift for my Mother( she is the expert on Jordan Almonds ) She said they were wonderful. Fresh and not over candied. My sisters agreed.<br />They arrived right away, well packed."
positive,21/10/19,These cookies really satisfy my hunger for chocolate!  They are not too sweet yet have an intense chocolate flavor without the high calories of a candy bar.  They are great!!!
positive,8/9/20,"I have been taking this for many years and love it.  The taste isn't bad at all, though, if you are used to having your Protein Drink sweetened with a lot of sugar or other sweetener, you will be disappointed as this does not taste like a McDonald's Milk Shake.  But the taste is fine.<br /><br />It is hard to underestimate the nutritional value of this product, as in addition to 26 grams of vegan protein, it is loaded with other healthful nutrients.  Each scoop has a pound of dried fruit and a pound of dried vegetables in it, plus a vitamin complex, and enzymes.<br /><br />If you are looking for a really excellent Vegan Protein this is the ticket, plus it serves as a meal replacement and a multi-vitamin."
positive,22/9/21,"Love this cereal, great taste and doesn't get soggy.  This is my favorite of all the Kashi cereals and subscribe and save makes it super convenient."
positive,2/10/20,My kids love these and I love giving them a treat that is not full of artificial junk. I have also tried them and they are very good.
positive,25/7/20,"I don't know how oats could vary, considering they are just one ingredient, but these are the best, tastiest, and perfect texture.  I thought I was crazy for thinking they tasted better than other, easier to locate brands, but then I read the other reviews and realized these oats really are the best!"
positive,4/7/21,"These are awesome, and well packaged, shipped promptly, at a fair price. Couldn't be happier."
positive,11/9/21,"This is my favorite of the 3 or 4 blends offered by emerald. Can only seem to find it at Amazon, since the local grocers seem to sell out of it right away or do not carry it. Will definitely be ordering this on a regular basis."
positive,4/7/21,"This product is SO fantastic!! The smoked salt is a perfect flavor for so many foods. My entire family LOVES cooking with this salt and we have a bottle of it on the table for personal use too. It's not too salty at all, it just adds a touch of saltiness and a wonderful smokiness to any dish. It's great on meats, potatoes, with cheddar cheese, eggs... It's a healthy alternative to bacon. It is so versatile it's amazing. This purchase is also a great deal- you get 3 jars for a great price! We love it and plan to continue to purchase this product so we'll never have to be without it again."
positive,21/9/21,"I contacted the seller regarding the best type the raw or liquid type for baking and they recommended the raw type.  I was disappointed with the results. Since then, I tried this in iced tea and again, was disappointed.  I had to continually stir the contents of a large pitcher because the honey sunk to the bottom.  The taste of the honey never diminished, but it was a pain in the neck to do the stirring every time I wanted a glass of iced tea.  Next time I will buy the regular honey."
positive,11/9/21,I bought this for a gift for my father and he loved it.  The only down side is the price.  I will only get these as gifts and not as a food staple due to the cost.
positive,12/10/21,This tea taste better iced than it does warm. I add stevia to it and it taste really good.
positive,11/10/21,Great tasting peanut butter!  A little thick for spreading on bread but if you are careful you can smooth it without messing up the bread.  Worth it though!!!
positive,28/9/21,The peanut butter was very fresh tasting.  The peanut chunks just as advertised were big.  The price was great.  The shipping was fast.  Lot easier to order on line than go to the store.
positive,19/10/21,"I 1st seen these on Shark Tank and what drew me to them was they were made for a diabetic by a diabetic. I decided to try a box and I can truly say they do taste good. They do fulfill that sweet satisfaction you look for. I'm not a big fan on granola bars but I think I can get use to these. They are also healthy, can't go wrong with that."
positive,4/7/21,These are a great snack.  They are filling and healthy for you.  My 3 year old even loves them.
positive,11/9/21,"I recently purchased this product and got a chance to try it out on some freshly popped popcorn. I was surprised this was so tasty! It has a mildly tangy white cheddar flavor, that's not too overpowering. This makes it easty to create a flavorful, savory snack without the extra calories. (As compared to potato chips or cheese crackers, for instance.) I hope to try the other flavors really soon."
positive,12/9/21,"this is the only kind of seasoning I use for my soy tacos.  I stopped buying the Del Taco flavoring when I read that it contains msg.  Just to give you an idea of my tastes, I loved the del taco seasonings, so Simply Organic is a great alternative that tastes just as good, without the side effects of msg."
positive,13/7/21,Great spice and I use it almost every day on all kinds of things. It is a large container but given how much flavor it adds I think that it probably is a good thing that I bought this much.
positive,23/10/21,I bought this tea for a diet I was going to start and find it very good. I drink it everyday now.
positive,22/9/21,"I needed to fill a giant pepper mill. I didn't know if this package would be enough. I had leftovers."
positive,4/7/21,"I'm not an expert on macaroni cheese from a box. I love the real thing, but it is time consuming. I've tried Kraft Macaroni Cheese, but I wasn't impressed. I read the good reviews for this Annie's product. I wanted to get the subscription to save money, but 12 packets was too many to buy, when I didn't even know if I would like it.<br /><br />I went to Walmarts and was lucky to get a packet, they didn't have many. I just compared the prices, in Walmart it costs $1.62 a box. On Amazon with the subscription, a box costs $1.23, that's a big saving.<br /><br />I made it yesterday, and mixed in a little grated mature cheddar, after it was cooked, then put it under the grill to melt the cheese. I was going to eat half and heat the rest up today, it was quite a lot for one person. It tasted so good, I ended eating all of it! If you like mature cheddar you'll probably like this. It is great with ketchup on or slices of tomatoes added with the cheddar before grilling it. It tastes almost as good as the reat thing.<br /><br />I ordered it on subscription yesterday, I can't wait to try it again."
positive,11/9/21,"I drink lots of tea, and I must say that this is a pretty enjoyable variety. The flavor is deep and hearty, and creates a nice dark brew.<br />My parents thought that it was a bit 'too strong', but I think that it is right-on (although one teabag can be used to make several perfectly good cups of tea).<br />If you're looking to try something new, I would definitely recommend that you give this a shot.<br /><br />It didn't totally blow me away, so I can't give it 5 stars - some loose tea (not in bags) that I have tried has been more flavorful, so that's why this gets a solid 4."
positive,8/8/21,"cardboard box is a bit shoddy, but the candies are perfect.  taste great, just as I remember them.<br /><br />4 flavors is kinda lacking, but so what."
positive,9/7/21,Easy to make--great organic maple sugar and oats--fantastic flavor.  Even my teenage daughter loves this single serving Oatmeal and enjoys it also as a snack after school.
positive,24/10/21,"Dr. McDougall's organic maple brown sugar light oatmeal is a fanatstic, healthy way to start your day. Made from organic oats & naturally sweetened, this hot cereal is miles ahead of the national brands found in your neighborhood grocery store. This oatmeal a delicious whole-grain, fiber rich way to make breakfast more nutritious. In fact, Dr. McDougall's instant oatmeal is a great light snack anytime of the day! Given the great deal Dr. McDougall's is on Amazon.com, national & bargain store brands of instant oatmeal simply cannot compete, even in a tight economy! Very well worth a try! Highly recommended!"
positive,4/7/21,We have purchased at least 20 boxes of David Pumpkin seeds and have not had a bad box in the lot.  Will continue buying this great treat.
positive,11/9/21,"We were disappointed when we could no longer obtain Violet Crumbles in the U.S. Then we discovered the Crunchie. Almost identical but better. These bars arrived on time and is perfect condition. None of the bars broken and no bloom. Nice, light, chocolate-covered sea foam in perfect condition."
negative,24/10/21,Looking to end caffein in my life.  Tried several caffein free brands and this one was a big disappointment.  Both my wife & I will not finish the 40??
positive,22/6/21,"I'm not a huge tea drinker (coffee every day) but I do enjoy black tea, Earl Grey, Chai tea and this tea is a nice addition. I bought it because I'd heard good things about it including Dr. Oz recommending it. At that point it was a question of which of the many oolongs on AMazon do I buy. I bought three. They are all very similar in flavor, require a touch of sweetener for my tastes but are very good. They are all a bit subdued in flavor with this one being in the middle. I've had no problems with the bags breaking or tea leaves or dust being everywhere."
positive,30/7/21,"I've only used one other Stevia product which was very good. This is just as good and does not leave any bitter aftertaste in my opinion. I only use it in my morning coffee- two packets for a 16oz cup. I'd definitely buy this product if I wanted to stick with something organic. However, I personally still prefer Splenda- whether it's good for me or not."
positive,10/7/21,"My favorite sweeteners are stevia and agave.  This Organic stevia has a bit of taste of both.  The main ingredient is agave inulin and then the second one is stevia.  This makes it really sweet with no aftertaste.  In fact, you can say that it almost has a hint of honey (must be the agave inulin)  It dissolves quickly too.<br /><br />A packet equals 2 tsp of sugar.  I like 1 tsp in my cup of coffe so I use only half a packet at a time.  It is very good though.  Considering that it is organic and natural, the price is slightly above what I would pay, but I think it's ok if you're used to buying other products with stevia.  Truvia costs about 50 cents less than this organic stevia at about the same number of packets, but truvia is not organic.  So it depends on what you're looking for."
positive,4/7/21,My spouse and I are both using this product and enjoy the slight taste of chocolate it gives the morning coffee.
positive,11/9/21,"great product, tastes great, love being able to buy in bulk at a good price, rivals generic prices. well worth it!"
positive,20/9/21,I took this stuff on a two week camping trip and had no problems with mess or attracting ants!  Tastes great. Note that this does not seem to reconstitute into a thick viscus honey-like substance. My results were much more watery  Use in place of sugar.
positive,13/10/21,"This is simply one of the best low calories food out there. Great taste, low calories, low sugar, high fiber.<br />If you want to eat pasta and don't want to rack up the calories, one answer: FiberGourmet!!!!!"
positive,2/8/21,"I love this cereal - it's sweet without being cloyingly sweet. You can eat a bowl and not feel like you've overdone your sugar ration for the rest of the day! We love Golden Grahams with the plain soy milk - unlike other cereals, this tastes just the same with regular milk or with soy milk."
positive,11/6/21,"Huge fan of this crystal light flavor.  I usually find crystal light drink mixes to be rather concentrated, so I mix one packet with 24 oz of water and it comes out just right--not too sweet.  The color of the mixed drink is also easy on the eyes--it is a pale green color, so nothing like the bright red, blue, purple, orange colors that some of the other drink mix flavors will give you."
positive,2/8/21,"Keenan's pistachios are great. I love having the no-salt option. The nuts are fresh with a very good flavor. Finding a clunker (inedible nut) in the bag is very rare."
positive,18/10/21,"Was pleasantly surprised.  They are very good and I don't miss the salt at all. Would always have to rinse off the salt but no longer."
positive,23/7/21,"I like the packaging (individually wrapped) and the taste of the coffee.  Can't find a thing wrong with it."
positive,8/7/21,"I received a free sample in with an order I'd placed on line, and thought ""why not try it?""  Only 15 calories and NO artificial sweeteners, flavors or preservatives. OH MY. I'm hooked.  The grape flavor isn't weak like Kool-aid; it's just right. Not too tart, not too sweet.  This product also has electrolytes in it, so it will help keep my hydrated when I work out."
positive,11/6/21,"Well, what kind of review can I write for snack bites.<br />I was quite surprised by their taste, which is very good.<br />I wish they were available in bigger packages, otherwise the packaging itself costs more than the bites.<br />That's the reason for 4 stars(I mean the cellophane costs as much as the meat)."
positive,25/6/21,"Grew up with them as a kid in California. Then disappeared for years. Found them while in the midwest for business and then on amazon. I'm very happy to have a breakfast favorite back!"
positive,2/8/21,i was a little bit uneasy at ordering a plant online. but bonsaiboy sent this beautiful cherry tree promptly and it arrived in beautiful condition. i will definitely recommend him again.
positive,11/6/21,Very nice blackberry tea without caffeine. The lack of caffeine allows a cup in the evening without interfering with sleep. Good taste -  up to the usual Lipton quality
positive,9/7/21,"I am already a fan/buyer of Lipton's herbal tea, having tried the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V9PH3A"">Island Mango & Peach</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM6PS0"">the Mandarin Orange</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V9PH4O"">Blueberry Pomegranate</a>.<br /><br />I like the fact that the ingredients are natural - hibiscus flowers, rosehips, blackberry, blueberry, raspberry. It's definitely 'herbal' tea - there are no actual tea leaves in the ingredients (which is why it's caffeine free).<br /><br />I also like that Lipton uses the least amount of material needed to make the tea bags, and they aren't wrapped individually. (The teas that do so annoy me, as wrapped bags are a time waster and a resources waster - there's no need to wrap each one!)<br /><br />I especially like the taste of the tea - it has a very nice flavor.<br /><br />Note: I use 9 bags at a time to make a full pitcher of iced tea."
positive,22/6/21,I bought this on the recommendation of Ruth Watson  the Hotel Inspector  and I use it in everything  frozen vegetables  soup  meats etc.
negative,2/8/21,the flakes are like eating twigs and straw I contacted company and they said would send coupons to replace my product but I never got any thing in the mail ever
positive,11/6/21,"I purchased this item because of my wheat allergy, but it tastes even better than the semolina elbows that I was using.  It cooks up in 7 minutes and even my husband who has no food allergies loves it!"
positive,8/7/21,For a time we could not get low carb pasta in our local store so I ordered this. It tastes great.
positive,28/9/21,"These healthy flakes taste very good even though they are low in sugar and high in fiber and nutritional value. They do lose their crispiness in a bowl of milk, but I either eat fast or snack on the flakes right out of the box. These make a great healthy substitute for other wheat flake cereals on the market."
positive,23/8/21,This has become our first choice for coffee. We have a Bed and Breakfast and the guest always comment on how good the coffee is. Great taste with a fantastic price.
positive,1/8/21,"All of these fruit snacks are large and tasty. Muscat was a little gross, but all in all, a great product."
positive,16/7/21,"These are just too tasty. Seriously, they need to come in a big box, like FiddleFaddle. I could munch on these all day long. I don't get to, as my wife and kids keep cleaning out my supplies before I can get to them. Damn you, 8-5PM job!!!"
positive,2/8/21,"A tasty snack, but a little too sweet.  Don't leave them in a warm car they get horribly sticky.  Not for someone with braces either."
positive,11/6/21,"I usually stick to 100 calorie pack snacks, but at only 130 calories, I thought I'd give these a try. They are very tasty-not too sweet, but enough to satisfy my ever-present sweet tooth. The size of the package is just right for a mid-day snack."
positive,26/6/21,"Just the right mix of chocolate, caramel and crunchy popcorn; very tasty. Plus the box is separated into 5 130-calorie packages so you don't sit down and eat the whole box at once."
positive,20/8/21,"For the price you cant beet it. It is not to sweet, but enough to have some flavor, and it really does taste like root beere."
positive,25/8/21,"This is a great 100 calorie snack, with great taste and texture.  Amazon delivered a fresh product with an expiration date a year out.<br /><br />To the guy who said there are only 4 cookies in a bag, that is crazy.  It is more like 20 cookies per bag, maybe more - I didn't count them, but I wasn't disappointed by it at all."
positive,19/10/21,"I really liked this a change up from strictly white tea.  Very expensive though, so will only order every once in awhile as a treat."
positive,2/8/21,"Izze is probably the best carbonated beverage that money can buy. Even better than Jones soda. All of Izze's flavors are all natural and taste fantastic. I especially love Sparkling Blackberry. It's worth paying more for the quality, especially since they have fewer calories than soda, and better ingredients. Very tasty and highly recommended."
positive,11/6/21,My son that I bought it for did not like it but I sure did. Used it in coffee and cocoa. Unique flavor. Best to blend a batch before using as it takes some effort to get to dissolve completely without clumping but even the clumps are great tasting!
positive,22/10/21,Great tasting. Found the right combo for taste. Better than eating all that sugar. you will not be disappointed with this syrup.
positive,6/8/21,"Eat Think Smile Cinnamon Almond Granola Clusters is a tasty snack that I enjoyed quite a bit.  It's not exactly health food, but I don't think there would be an issue in enjoying this treat in moderation.<br /><br />Eat Think Smile Cinnamon Almond Granola Clusters are made up of large granola clusters, too big to be eaten easily as a breakfast cereal but just the right size for snacking.  The most obvious ingredients are oats, almond bits, cocoa, and cinnamon.  Neither the cocoa or cinnamon taste is overpowering at all, and I found that the combination of these two tastes was much better than I would have expected.<br /><br />Now as I mentioned above I would not consider this product health food, despite the claims on the package about the antioxidant power of the cocoa and cinnamon.  After all, a small serving contains 6 grams of fat and 12 grams of sugar, and among the ingredients listed are brown sugar, palm oil, and evaporated sugar cane juice.  But as a substitute for more highly processed sweets this will do OK.  Overall I am a fan of Eat Think Smile Cinnamon Almond Granola Clusters and would likely buy it in the future."
positive,24/6/21,"Gluten free pasta can be less than acceptable- this brand of pasta tastes just like regular pasta. Even my husband, who is not gluten free, loves the taste. I have tried all the styles of their brown rice pasta- Excellent!"
positive,17/4/21,"These are delicious and though they have a lot of sugar they also have a lot of vitamin C.  If you have trouble getting the kids to eat oranges, strawberries or anything with vitamin C - these can help.<br /><br />These sell for a good price too, especially with the food discount going on!"
positive,10/3/21,I have tried many versions of Stevia and this one seems to taste the best.
negative,17/4/21,The muffiins had absolutely no taste.  I added some extra sweetener and some ginger and cinnamon and they tasted much better.
positive,21/1/21,"I'm a newbie when it comes to homemade waffles. I purchased a belgian waffle maker through Amazon and was looking for a good recipe for the waffles. When reading the reviews of the waffle maker, so many mentioned this waffle mix that I figured I would give it a try instead of making my own. I'm so glad I did! I used the tip of adding milk instead of water and followed the rest of the directions exactly. From start to finish this morning, I was enjoying fresh waffles in 5 minutes. The taste was restaurant quality and it was easier than I imagined."
positive,30/1/21,"I wanted something to fill the new flask I just bought so I scoured the whiskey aisle and this product caught my eye.  Boy am I glad it did.  After one bottle shared with friends over the weekend, I am ready for more.  My new favorite.  I do admit with others that it is a bit sweet but hey, what did you expect from maple syrup?  Try it, you won't be disappointed."
positive,13/2/21,"This was an unusual treat that I normally would not think about getting. However, I got it and was very surprised at how food it actually was. Surprises await you when you try new things."
positive,15/1/21,"These crackers are a great treat for those who are gluten intolerant as well as those who may be looking for a potato chip substitute.  These rice crackers have good flavor, good crunch and just enough salt."
positive,6/3/21,I bought some of this tea at Jungle Jims and absolutely love the frangrance as it is steeping and the taste is wonderful. I even make it into iced tea.
positive,8/6/21,"This is very tasty!  It is a great item to have around for company.  Pull out some crackers, put some cream cheese (or even havarti or edam work well), and then top it off with this yummy jam.  It is hard to find where I live."
positive,7/1/21,"I didn't think I would like chocolate in my granola, but this is awesome stuff. When a craving for something sweet hits, now I know I am eating a healthy alternative to the chocolate I usually eat. The walnuts and cranberrys are just gravy. Really good snack when you want something sweet."
positive,17/4/21,"This was a tasty snack that I enjoyed. Might be a little to hard for those with teeth problems, but otherwise okay. Oats, walnuts, and cranberry with a little chocolate is a good combination."
positive,10/3/21,"Purchase from the commissary! Perfect snack size, the combination of the crackers and tuna make very balance protein to carb ratio and total calories are under my 250 calorie per meal (eat small meals every 3 hours). Taste is spicey and yummy without a ""sauce"". I tried a different BRAND and it had a sauce in the tuna,yuck. Not this! I also used this to make tuna cakes and did not have to add ANY seasoning!  They were such a hit I had to go buy a case from the commissary to share with the ladies group!! Hoping Amazon will get it so that I can order it as an automatic subscription. Even my hubbie that is not a seafood person, loves it."
positive,14/1/21,"easy to prepare,the filling is very tasty,i made a salad with one box,everyone loved it."
positive,24/5/21,"Order came promptly. We love this easy way to make a flavor addition to a number of our foods. Will likely try other products from this line. The food bloggers were right, very yummy."
positive,14/10/21,Been buying Haribo products for 40 years.  Noticed they even are starting to put some sugar back into  their products. Tasty as usual.
positive,7/2/21,"Kona tastes just as great as always. I'm so glad to find a site that I can buy from and not be burned."
positive,29/3/21,"My kids and I enjoy this served with warm pita bread for lunch. It is a little spicy to me, but my husband disagrees. It's quick, easy and tasty."
positive,17/4/21,Fast delivery.  I like the fact I am getting 84 trace minerals and iodine.  Better than normal table salt.  Also bought the bulk package too.
positive,10/3/21,"This is a tasty seasoning mix.  The instructions call for deep frying the chicken, but it tastes just as good if you pan fry with minimal oil.  It is not that spicy, so add some pepper sauce if you like it really hot.  You can probably create this seasoning pretty easily by yourself for less money, but the pre-mixed packet is nice for lazy people who don't have lots of different ingredients lying around in their kitchen."
positive,10/7/21,"This is a must have!  Spices are just right.  A little on the spicy side, but not too hot for people that doesn't eat hot spicy foods.  Captures the taste of New Orleans!!  I add smoked sausage slices and it everyone loves it!"
positive,27/1/21,"I lived in Europe when I was and would purchase these from street-side kiosks. These are good however I ""age"" them to greatness by leaving the cover off for about a week. This gives the belts just the right amount of staleness and brings back the nostalgia of youth."
positive,1/6/21,Received my order today. I was very pleased with the fast shipping. A++ 5oz dried is a lot. I ordered 2 which will last me a longgggggggg time.
positive,20/8/21,It tastes really good but is the price wrong $5.16 each!!?? You can get the for a dollar each on sale at Vons....
positive,14/8/21,If you are a chipotle lover you know its hard to find good chipotle spice.  This chipotle surprised we with great taste and yes its hot but not a burn your  tongue no taste hot.
positive,21/4/21,"I wish these came in larger quantities, if I could have a cuppa everyday I would. So refreshing and tasty!"
positive,1/4/21,"This drink is so delicious. I'd had the chocolate chai before, so thought I'd try the vanilla chai. Though the vanilla taste is not as strong as the chocolate taste, it's still so yummy. Great price on amazon too!"
positive,17/4/21,"My daughter and I love the taste of Big Train Vanilla Chai, it isn't too spicy like other Chai's can be."
positive,10/3/21,"I liked it well enough.  Not my all-time favorite, as I prefer my Trio bars (nuts & fruits) for breakfast, however, if you're a chocolate fan but feel guilty about eating candy, this is the product for you."
positive,22/4/21,"Great milk, my 4 year old loves it.  We used to drink the kirkland brand but can't get that where we live now."
positive,25/4/21,One of the few soy milks my slightly milk allergic kids will drink consistently.  Easy to carry and just the right amount per box.  Price on Amazon is quite a bit cheaper than the pice in our local stores.
negative,1/4/21,"the other ones are really good -- just cherries, for example<br /><br />just cranberries taste like nothing and are impossible to chew on.  no sweetness.. no tartness.. no bitterness... taste like eating cotton"
positive,30/6/21,"Generally shy away from flavored milk or ""like milk"" products...but this Nestle product tastes really good. The kids and grandkids all like it too. Not slimey and no funny after taste...much better for the kiddos than sodapop. :)"
positive,1/3/21,"For those that need decaf, but still like the strong and bold taste. This is the one. My go to cup of decaf."
negative,29/1/21,"I have purchased GF oats from Bob's Red Mill and from Legacy Valley.  I store all my grains in the freezer so they should not become rancid once they are in my possession.  But the oats from Legacy Valley taste rancid, they have a very bitter after taste.  None of my kids will eat them and unfortunately I bought a whole case.  I do NOT recommend this product.  Buy Bob's Red Mill instead!"
positive,17/4/21,"The Tanka Bars I purchased were moist, solid, tasty without too much salt or sweetener, and a small amount alleviated hunger for several hours at a time. As I diabetic type II I often have hunger pangs throughout the day. Pieces from one bar provided my body with enough energy to make it dinner time without the need for a sugar lift. This helped me maintain a steady blood glucose level all day.<br />A little bit goes a long way so it should not be gobbled like an energy bar. The taste will tempt you to do so.<br />It is pricey, but certainly worth it. I keep several in my Go-Bag."
positive,10/3/21,"Not sure about how these are priced, as I bought them originally at the dollar tree for... $1, but it was a package of only 8 oz, not the 15 oz available here on Amazon.  The cookies were such a surprise, especially coming from the $ store! They were so good I wanted to eat the whole box.  They are super tasty with coffee, like biscotti, but more melt in your mouth.  Not too sweet, not too bland, just right.  Loved them."
positive,30/5/21,"I ordered Jyoti Natural Foods looking for something healthy and quick, while providing a lot of protein. This tastes really good! I was shockingly surprised and relieved my money was well spent. I've had Indian food at very authentic places (have a lot of Indian friends) and I'd say this is very close to going out to eat. Highly recommend."
positive,28/9/21,"My husband enjoys this for lunch with warm pita bread. It's quick, easy, and tasty. He can just heat it up at work in the microwave."
positive,6/5/21,Tasty! Great breakfast blend. Not too terribly strong. Would recommend. Well worth the price. Will order more soon. Buy it.
positive,20/4/21,This is a great tasting cup of coffee even though a little strong  for some.  My only complaint is the price.<br />I drink several cups of coffee a day and this is cost prohibitive for me.
positive,20/4/21,"My dog is crazy over this food.  Usually very finicky, but loves tis product!"
positive,21/4/21,"I just received these as a birthday gift from my sister.  The strawberries were perfectly fresh, juicy, and sweet.  They were dipped perfectly and completely coated in delicious chocolate.  I was SO impressed!  She ordered them yesterday and I received them today.  They came nicely wrapped with birthday ribbon and packaged with a ""freezer"" or cold pak.  Again, I would highly recommend these as a delicious treat.  They are expensive, but well worth the SPECIAL treat for someone!"
positive,2/5/21,"I find these to be addictively tasty.  I like the 6 oz tins because if I eat a whole tin it's not really that bad (compared to 12 oz)."
positive,18/12/19,"I use this as a treat for training and my dog just begs for more lessons!  I slice into small bites then add a little warm water and soak for 5 mins ... easy ... and my dog won't choke when she ""inhales"" the food during lessons."
positive,19/1/20,This product is a great organic version of tuna helper.  My family loves it and it tastes great!
positive,19/1/20,"I bought my first jar of Kraft's Vegemite (the Australian brand) and I must say the flavor is strong, salty, and slightly bitter.  Every morning I have a bit of Vegemite on my buttered toast.  I have quickly become very fond of this new morning ritual.  It is an excellent source of folic acid and B Vitamins.  I recommend that you experience the flavor sensation for yourself."
positive,31/3/20,"like all other diet powdered chocolate, it doesn't dissolve well, even in the hottest water.  You have to smash some of it against the side of the cup to get it to dissolve.  I use it in my coffee... mmmmmmmmm yum"
positive,18/12/19,"I absolutely love this drink, but everyone else I know cannot understand why I do.  They all say it taste like medicine, but to me its delicious liquid crack. I suggest trying one before buying a 24pk because it is an acquired taste.  I love it and have been drinking this for years."
positive,13/10/19,This tea is very robust and tasty especially after a long tiring day at work. I sooths your nerves after a long day and works wonders on a cold winter evening while reading or just chilling.
positive,28/9/20,This is the second time I have purchased this item. No sugar added taste like regular chocolate not like sugar free which is awful. Good night time drink before bed
positive,16/11/20,"The hot chocolate has a great taste. I purchased it because my sister was worried about the kids having too much sugar every night before bed. The kids had no idea it was sugar free. Even the adults we gave it to had no clue. Like other reviewers said - it doesn't mix very well so we actually made it on the stove in a pot so it would have time to mix up. If you were looking to make one packet with just some hot water, stir it a lot and even then you will have some chocolate not melted. On a positive note, each packet does make a decent size cup of hot chocolate. Enjoy!"
positive,27/2/20,This is probably the best tasting zero calorie flavored water Ive ever had. Becareful though this does have sugar alcohol in it and if you have too much it can cause bowel discomfort.
positive,26/2/21,"If you like strong coffee you this with the medium r small size setting.  I prefer mine on the maximum water setting and it is quite tasty and very consistant from box to box.  I have tasted better only in coffee specialty cafe's.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0GV90"">Timothy's World Coffee, Midnight Magic, Extra Bold, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>"
positive,18/12/19,"This is about as good a cup of coffee as you can get.  Single serving is great and although it may cost more per pound it saves money in the long run because you don't throw any away.  Always hot and always fresh.  With scheduled deliveries I never run out.  I strongly recommend it."
positive,19/1/20,this is the best coffee if you like a strong cup. a real wake me up
positive,13/9/20,"So many  flavorings like this sound and look great but taste funky,<br />this tastes great . I have only tried the black cherry , and it does give you a little boost as well, not a caffiene heart thumper."
positive,10/7/20,"It taste good! But 30 bags seems too much for me, so ,,,,Share with your friends!<br />Also suggest other flavor of Indomie noddles"
positive,14/4/21,"These taste so much better than the ones I bought at the grocery store which turned out to be ""plain white sugar sprayed with carmel coloring"".  These are 100% pure Demerara sugar with a taste similar to brown sugar."
positive,24/4/21,"This brand of pasta is easy to cook, and taste great. My children can't tell the difference between it and wheat pasta."
positive,28/4/21,"I like this product because it has a lot of protein, and WHEY protein since I am allergic to soy which is in almost everything else. It tastes good, promises no junk included, and seems to work well for me."
positive,12/7/21,Ordered these after receiving my new k-cup machine.  Taste great after finding the correct serving size.  Quick service and good price.  Definitely ordering more!
positive,18/12/19,"We lived in Hawaii for a few years.  Have been searching for Kona or Maui coffe.  We live in secluded area, so have been ordering on line.  Not too much acid.  Great tasting."
positive,19/1/20,"It's not a complete replacement for sugar, but it tastes great and substitutes for sugar more often than not."
positive,28/4/21,"I was introduced to Kilambe coffee by a friend and immediately i tasted quality. It is now part of my special collection along with my Vietnamese coffee used only on weekends, special occasions, or having guests over. If you enjoy a dark, bold taste with the slightest scent chocolate and a fruity feel from mother nature at high altitude, Kilambe is for you."
positive,8/8/20,"Bought this for my wife. We'd recently bought a Celestial Seasons variety pack and had been stunned by the over-a-dollar-a-cup price tag. This was a much better buy and is now my wife's favorite K-Cup tea, regardless of price. I just wish Amazon would offer it as a subscription so we can shave off that fifteen percent!"
positive,22/5/21,"I am pleased with this salad dressing. The olive oil flavor comes through nicely. I have used this salad dressing on regular garden type salads and it tastes like home made dressing. I have also used in pasta salad and it adds a zesty taste. Using this olive oil based dressing is a good marinade for meats, chicken or even veggies, especially if grilling. There is a good balance between the herbs and olive oil to make this salad dressing taste good in different types of food. If you like vinegrette, you will find many uses for this product. I highly recommend it."
positive,18/12/19,"though it made my water taste better, it did not make me zippy...I did feel as though I was getting nutrients and enjoyed the flavor...it did not take much to give it taste either"
positive,19/1/20,"I add this to my cold brew lipton ice tea that I prepare.  Took a bit of experimenting to get the right amount of juice concentrate but once perfected, it's like drinking the perfect blend of sweetened ice tea.  The taste is great and no calories, can't beat that.  Only demerits is that the price is rather high.  Could use a few dollars off on the bulk purchases."
positive,3/8/20,"This liquid vitamin is pretty tasty. I thought it made my water taste like watered down Crystal Light. My kids also liked that it made their water turn pink and gave it a faint sweet taste.  It's not overwhelming in sweetness or vitamin in taste. I could not detect the vitamins at all. The only downside is that it requires refrigeration after opening."
positive,29/7/21,"This drink tastes as good or better than similar drinks that we've had that are made of powder.  The directions don't tell you how much to squeeze into your water, so I would imagine it depends on how big of a glass or bottle you have and how strong you want it to taste.  You can always add more.  The only concern I have about it is there is caffeine in it and I really don't want to have any extra caffeine after my coffee in the morning.  You might want to beware of that if you are buying this for children."
positive,8/7/20,"Tried the fruit punch in a glass of water. A little goes a long way and tastes great! Turn bottled water or tap water into a great tasting beverage: refreshing, no cal and healthy"
positive,13/4/21,"I'm always looking for a good energy drink, that will give me a boost, but not a big let down.  I like the glaceau energy water.  This is a good alternative.  This makes 24 8-ounce servings, at $6 a bottle it's only 25 cents a glass vs $1.50 or so for the vitamin water by glaceau or others found in the supermarkets and  convenience stores.<br />  The flavor is like a light fruit punch. You can control how much you want to add to your water for taste.  It has a combination of vitamins B 6, 5, 3, and 12, Vitamin C, Zinc, Magnesium, and Chromium.  It has about the same amount of caffeine as a can of soda, so not too much, no jittery feeling after drinking it.<br />  It is good to get healthy vitamins while I'm drinking water and not just sugar and caffeine from sodas."
positive,20/2/21,"I do not drink ""energy"" drinks on a regular basis, but I do enjoy them while outside exercising.  Energy drinks usually have sugars and caffeine in order to claim to be ""energy"" drinks, and this stuff also has taurine in it.  One can also taste the sucralose.  It also contains Vitamin C,B3, B5, B6, B12 and electrolytes.<br /><br />The taste is a citrusy punch delight, and the fact that this comes out of a squeeze bottle that is measured to yield 24 servings means it's easier to allow for more or less liquid according to taste.  I prefer my drinks on the weak side because I drink more of it and strong red drinks tend to leave a red ""moustache"" on my upper lip.  The red dye in this mixture can stain countertops, so be careful when pouring this!<br /><br />Liquid easily comes out of the bottle and returned to the frig afterwards.  For the occassional drinker who would need a month to finish off the contents, this isn't a bad-tasting mixture.  I haven't felt a ""zing"" after drinking this, though."
positive,9/12/20,"This is not nearly as concentrated as the MIO water flavors that you also squirt into your glass or bottle of water.  But, you get a lot more of it (12 oz) and one 1/2 fluid oz. squirt has 120% daily requirement for vitamin C and no calories.  The fruit punch tastes good, however I like my water to be very weakly flavored so I probably put in about a 1/2 squirt giving me 60% of my daily requirement for vitamin C.<br /><br />It's mainly advertised as being a source of vitamin C, but there are more things beside vitamin C in it:<br /><br />Vitamin C - 120%<br />Vitamin B6 - 40%<br />Vitamin B5 - 40%<br />Vitamin B3 - 40%<br />Vitamin B12 - 40%<br />Zinc - 10%<br />Chromium - 10%<br /><br />The plastic bottle is a good shape for your hand to grab it easily and squeeze.  This might be a good way to get some needed vitamin C without having to eat a lot of citrus or swallowing vitamin C pills.  And, if you like your water flavored but are particular like me, about how much flavor is in it, then this is a good way to control it."
positive,1/4/21,"I love this drink. Squeeze a bit into water, lemonade , or club soda. This tastes great. I found it to have a fruit taste a little sweet, and the best part you do not have to use a lot. I found it out to be  better then the Mio. Fits in my bag, no more pricey drinks at stores no more. A few drops and I have a refreshing drink. Everyone in my family really enjoyed it as well."
positive,25/2/21,"I really love this stuff and I will be buying more for sure. One bottle lasts a really long time, too. It is better than any of the diet fruit punches I have tried so far. I really can't recommend this enough. 5/5 stars."
positive,18/12/19,"Having worked in a movie theater in high school and through college, popcorn is a very nice treat.  That was 40 years ago, and it is still a very nice treat.  The seasoning salt makes this treat even more enjoyable by adding the right flavor to the popcorn to bring back memories of going to a movie in a less stressful time."
positive,19/1/20,"Everyone likes this.  It's very salty, so you only need to use a tiny bit.  I add about half a teaspoon to the popcorn before popping and it's very tasty.  This carton should last for a long time."
positive,14/10/20,My cats love this food and particularly the duck flavor.<br /><br />This is a high quality cat food however depending on your cat he/she may prefer another brand/flavor.  What can be said is that this is a really healthy food for your cat.
positive,10/3/21,I usually use Hellmann and bought this and will be purchasing it again.  My family and I really like it.
positive,15/8/21,"I really like the taste just a touch of salt but they are more chewy then I would like. The Gustaf's rounds are a little better."
positive,27/4/21,"Very tasty. But as a word of caution. Do not over eat these bears. When the label warns you it may have a laxative affect, BELIEVE IT! otherwise enjoy!"
positive,24/1/21,"A good product overall. It's just a base, so anything you add will step up the flavor. Tastes good with any meat. A little butter and plain yogurt mixed in makes it smooth a creamy. The TIGER TIGER and PATAK's ready-made sauces are good too."
positive,14/7/20,"Biryani when done as per instructed comes out really good and authentic! I dont like their other products, but highly recommend this for any Indian food lover. Total preparation time is around 1 hour, but its really worth it"
positive,5/6/21,"We tried all different saimins (noodles), the dashi (soup)is most delicious. Didn't know Koreans made saimins too. They are better then Japanese saimins (noodles). Cannot wait till I receive them."
positive,9/7/21,"I saw these as I was checking out of a beer store (honestly!) and thought I would give them a try. They are all organic, and taste great. They are also all shaped somewhat differently roundish, which gives them a unique - homemade - look. The color is a bit off-white as well, with some dark chunks (small, but not specks) in them, which adds to the unique appearance. These are not made with artificial sweeteners, yet the calorie/carb content is very low. The mint flavor is interesting, because I found it got MORE intense as kept on sucking, not less so as others do. Great product, and much cheaper here than where I bought mine. Cool!"
positive,5/6/21,"I received this item as part of a gift during the Christmas Holidays.  I enjoyed it so much I got on the internet and searched until I found it.  Although it may not be everyones ""cup of tea,"" it will become a regular part of the holidays at my house!!!"
negative,25/7/21,"These are much lower quality than the usual poppy seeds I purchase.  As some of the other reviewers described, they have almost a ""dirty"" taste to them and not much normal poppy seed flavor.  They are not good for baking.  I'm wondering if they are used for something else like poppy tea which would explain their high ratings by others. I ended up throwing out both bags.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Cheap price.<br />Non-irradiated.<br />Fast delivery.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Poor taste.<br />Not baking/eating quality.<br />Unusable for eating/cooking (so cheap price doesn't really matter.)"
positive,13/7/21,"I enjoy this tea plain, with honey, or with a splash of milk.<br />The ingredients are simple and natural;  no soy lecithin, no so called natural flavorings.  Very difficult to find herbal tea in the market place that doesn't have junk added to cheap it out.<br /><br />My children enjoy this tea warm with honey during the winter.  Iced during the summer with a hint of sugar and a wedge of lemon.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Hibiscus, cinnamon, Ginger, peppermint, orange peel, rose hips, rose petals"
positive,9/7/21,"My two basenjis had a few guests over last week end and came the time to share a few bully sticks the atmosphere was electric!  Everybody was sitting nicely, some of them were holding their paw in the air as if to say:"" me first, me first!!!"" The noses were twitching, the tongues were meticulously run over them, turning every piece of olfactive information into tasty dribble. Anxious eyes, opened socket expanding  wide, the wait was unbearable! After a few seconds of this gleeful spectacle I handed the treats out. Everybody grabbed theirs, there were a few side glances, a couple were dropped but immediately retrieved, nerves you see, and after one or two growls the chewing began. It sounded like a mini munching factory. The stench was heavenly and when every little fiber had been devoured we all cheered for ValueBull. Tree times."
positive,8/7/21,"I have to respectfully disagree with some of the other reviewers.<br /><br />Although I did not find this the best version of Earl Grey out there it was very tasty and I enjoyed it.<br /><br />For a system that can provide me with Tea at a moments notice I am quite pleased.  You can't expect something that provides you convenience like the Tassimo to produce the same results as hand brewing from a tea bag or leaves."
positive,15/7/21,"According to my Labs, this tastes great.  It also lasts a long time against two chewers that get through most anything very quickly."
positive,6/7/21,"I am currently in Afghanistan and we received this mix in a care package!!  The smell filled our entire building.  We almost had to lock our door to keep people out!  The entire loaf was gone in about 5 minutes.  Absolutely delicious!  We added the 8 oz. of water and then added another ounce because the dough looked a little dry.  Again, this was one of the best breads we have made here yet and will be ordering some very soon!!"
positive,13/8/21,"They were very tasty. Bought them for my son,he is interested in anything Japanese. They last a while in your mouth but not too chewy almost like gum you can swallow. They have a great flavor not to sweet or tart. I highly recommend them. the price was good as well $11 for 10 pack I believe."
positive,5/6/21,"I fell in love with this tasty snack when I grew up in England.  I guess it is fortunate that when I have opened a bag to indulge these addictive snacks, no one wants anything to do with them.  It truly is an acquired taste but once you have it you can't stop.  I love them with a cool cocktail in the evenings, especially a whiskey sour.  I buy them now by the case and can't wait to get home tonight to indulge!"
positive,9/7/21,The fruit cake is very tasty and pricy (as all the good ones are). Glad I found it.
positive,17/6/21,This coffee is very strong tasting. We cut it in half with regular coffee and it still tastes wonderful. It makes the house smell like maple syrup as it is brewing but the taste is not too much! Love it!
positive,31/8/21,"Took a while to arrive and the box was kind of dingy, but it was well worth the wait.  Nice kick for coffee, sugar free ice cream, and as flavored sweetener."
positive,7/8/21,"I love this coffee. I've been drinking Eight O'Clock for years until I tried Cameron's Southern Pecan, which is much better. It has a definite nutty flavor, the pecan flavor itself more subtle, but definitely detectable. A little chocolaty flavor adds to it to make a rich but not bitter taste if brewed right. I find that 2 level tablespoons to 6 oz. of water is about right, but I make mine slightly stronger. Anything less than 2 tablespoons to 6 oz. and it'll taste like average store-bought. It's just got a wonderful warm flavor. I just make enough for 2 cups in the morning, grinding enough beans for 3 days so it doesn't lose flavor. Great stuff!"
negative,6/9/21,"I WISH I COULD GIVE THIS PRODUCT A NEGATIVE NUMBER FOR MY REVIEW.....THIS IS THE WORST THING I HAVE EVER PURCHASED HERE ON AMAZON IN THE LAST 14 YRS OF USING THIS WONDERFUL SITE.  PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT, IT LITERALLY TASTE LIKE ""DIRT"".  I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYONE WHO HAS TRIED THIS PRODUCT HAS LIKED IT....  NOTICED I HAVEN'T CALLED THIS PRODUCT BY IT'S NAME ""CINNAMON"" REASON? BECAUSE IT'S NOT....IT'S DIRT.  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO PICK UP MCCORMICKS CINNAMON(WHAT I HAD TO DO).  IF THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE THIS DIRT READ THIS REVIEW PLEASE CONTACT ME AND LET ME KNOW HOW I CAN GET A REFUND AND RETURN THIS DIRT TO YOU.  YOU GUYS SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES FOR SELLING THIS ""DIRT"" AND PASSING IT OFF AS CINNAMON."
positive,5/6/21,"This soda bread mix makes for good food.  It's very expensive though... but for the right occasion or a treat, I will buy again."
positive,9/7/21,"I bought these berries as I needed to add something to my cart for super saver shipping.  I was planning to get goji berries from Whole Foods in bulk, the cheapest source by me for organic gojis in town.  They run about $18 a pound there.  I got them on sale here for $11-12.  I liked the ones from Whole Foods, but these are even better!  They are fresher, probably since they are put reasonably quickly into the bags and sealed.  The other ones taste like some sort of gummy fruit rolll-up type treat (good), but these actually taste like a fruit.  You should buy some.  The only problem is that I eat them too quickly, they should be called wolf-them-down-berry."
positive,19/6/21,"Oil is very pleasant to the palate Fruity with a distint olive taste, which is what I was looking for. Excellent product. Far superior to any Italian EVO I have tried."
positive,5/9/21,"Tastes every bit as delicious as regular Heinz ketchup.  What was disappointing, however, is that I purchased 12 bottles and the expiration date on each bottle was only 5 months from the date of purchase.  This was VERY disappointing as I had expected an expiration date of at least one year or more!"
positive,10/10/21,"Chervil, the one spice I didn't realize was so darn hard to get. After searching up and down this infernal state in hopes of finding it somewhere in person I outstretched my arms to the infamous internet.  More specifically, Amazon!<br /><br />I typed in the letters and wallah, I found items.  I decided to try this, as I have limited experience with Chervil, I'll admit it, and I am happy to report that it was safely in my hands exactly when I wanted it.  I opened it up to sample the herb, and from what I could tell it was also exactly as described. I'd recommend this herb for at least a taste of something different and considering the speed at which I got the item, I am extremely happy.<br /><br />So till I experiment again, live long and eat well!"
positive,29/9/21,"product was great, shipped when it should have, price was right. I would recomend this product to others. We use the raw coconut butter in our oatmeal and toast."
positive,11/9/21,"Quick and easy to prepare. This is one of the few whole wheat pastas I've found that has a great taste. I use orzo in place of rice in recipes, as well as in soups, etc."
positive,5/6/21,Each of the gummies are in indiviually wrapped bags.. like one. they fit perfectly in my favor bags for my wedding would for sure get these again in the future. really adorable.
positive,9/7/21,"I goit my package a day late, which isn't that bad, buuuuut... eh. At least it got here!<br />I had a BLISS almost immediately after opening the box. At first the fizziness and awesome was amazing, and the taste was grand, but the fizziness left really quickly... ):<br />I did not feel blissfull, but instead i fell asleep for about two hours.<br /><br />The sonic, I just opened and have taken two sips. Amazing flavour, amazing stuff. I'm already feeling a bit of energy :D<br /><br />I LOVELOVELOVE that the top slides off and can act as a cup! Its helping me make sure I drink it slowly, and enjoy it as much as possible!<br /><br />Great product overall! The four-star is only because of the day-late package. I'm sure its because I ordered on a Friday and so there was confusion about weekend timings and such, eh?"
positive,26/8/21,"Just received my shipment - ""best by"" date is June of 2012 and it's mid-March.  Even though it's only me, I'm pretty sure I'll use most of it by the time June rolls around.  Tasted just like the Starbucks pods I've purchased locally (before the stores stopped carrying them).  Definitely no complaints."
positive,26/7/21,"As far as English Tea's go it is at the top of my list. Very beautiful dark red color and incredibly flavourful. I drink about 3 cups of this Tea a day, though sometimes I will mix the day up with a cup of Barry's Gold blend. also a fantastic tea, though i feel Yorkshire gold is better by just a hair."
positive,11/9/21,It really rastes great. No real aftertaste either like some other energy drinks. Color is fun as well and makes for a great mixer. I will order again.
positive,11/9/21,"The product description is very accurate.  I received my item in a timely manner and the items were well packaged and still frozen.  The portions are large and are very easy to prepare in the oven.  And, of course, the Chicken Cordon Bleu has a wonderful, savory taste that isn't skimpy on either the ham or cheese.<br /><br />If I could rate 4.5 stars I would, simply due to price. However, don't let price stop you from ordering....these are delicious."
positive,15/9/21,"I bought this in an effort to reduce my sodium intake and replace ketchup on everything I eat.  I've put in on eggs, cauliflower, cabbage and some meat dishes.  Tastes great!  Very happy with this and will try some other flavors."
positive,5/6/21,"This was my first time eating Pad Thai favored anything. These were the very thin noodles if I remember correctly.<br />It's a unique taste compared to most ramen, I mean fried noodles, I have purchased in the last month.<br />Definitely worth a try if you are planning on tasting some different Asian dishes."
negative,9/7/21,"I used to be allergic to peanuts as a child, and I have a strong taste aversion to peanuts and peanut butter, but I love almond butter. After hearing rave reviews for Barney Butter, I decided to try out their version. I don't know how they do it, but somehow Barney Butter tastes EXACTLY like peanut butter! I know that this is a plus for some, but if you like peanut butter, why wouldn't you just buy peanut butter? Why make perfectly good almonds taste like peanuts? If I buy almond butter, I want it to taste like almonds."
positive,14/9/21,"These granola bars are quite delicious. Out of the three bars that Kashi makes, these are my second favorite (next to the Trail Mix ones). These make a good snack."
positive,29/9/21,"Nice for break fast. No bloated tummy,applely flavor.Enjoyed several breakfastes with the pan cakes. Good taste and texture.Yummy for kids too."
positive,10/7/21,"These are by far and away THE best chocolate chip granola bars..They're nice and chewy, without being too dry or wearing out your jaw like other organic granola bars.  We are never without these as a special treat for us or our kids! However, they're way cheaper at Walmart .. around $2.75 a box and there are generally coupons that can be printed online which brings the price inline with a sale price on Quaker bars, which don't even come close in taste to the Cascadian Farms bars, not to mention the high frutose corn syrups and hydrogenated oils in Quaker bars .. Even with Subscribe and Save these are $3.44 a box, boo for the price!"
positive,1/3/20,"I dont know if I believe this tea is helpful for losing weight, but it tastes great and its a wonderful alternative to soda...which is the reason I bought it."
positive,28/7/20,"I was a bit cautious when I first opened the box. I need gluten free and sugar free products with low carbs. This candy fit the bill. The texture is a bit strange but,Wow the candy is tasty and lasts a long time. I bought the ginger, licorice  and raspberry flavor."
positive,28/7/20,My favorite coffee!  It is very dark and has a wonderful flavor without the bitterness!  Reminds me of the coffees served in Germany.
positive,10/11/19,"This is great tasting coffee.  I've been buying Melitta coffee for over twenty years and it's the only brand of coffee I will buy.  It's great that I can order it through Amazon."
positive,1/3/20,"Baby loves this and so do I. It's very tasty and great for breakfast or lunch. One of our favorite banana combos, but the beet comes through and of course the blueberry just adds a little something extra. Highly recommend."
positive,3/8/19,"These are delicious, it's been hard to find a good stewed tomato,the kind my mom used to can.  This is very close. A real fresh tomato taste and seasoned perfectly. Other brands have a tinny taste to them and usually are too sweet."
positive,6/2/21,"I can't say enough about this Philadelphia suburb local company(Bala Cynwyd!).  I hope one day Skinny Water will be linked with Philly like soft prezels and cheese steaks (of course the best cheese steaks are in the suburbs of Philly).  This product got me off soda!!!!"
negative,24/2/21,"Tried this and the Chicken, neither left a pleasant taste at all. They were bitter and just not good for a soup base."
positive,13/5/21,"I have tried all the commercial brands of Hemp Milk. The second best to Tempt is Hemp Bliss by Manitoba Harvest, which is more ""green"" tasting. Tempt Unsweetened Original is delicious enough to drink straight with no grassy notes. After a few mornings of breakfast with Tempt, I feel like I am almost eating cereal with milk. By itself it is refreshing.<br /><br />What's greatest of all is that there are no pesticides or herbicides, and no GMOs and hemp is grown on sustainable farms. The ingredients are free of gums, preservatives, chemicals and flavor enhancers and this one has no sweeteners. The only real downside is, like almost every commercial producer, they insist on adding traces of cheap vitamins to produce an unbleak ""Nutritional Analysis."" I take exception to the addition of ""Vitamin A Palmitate"" in particular as having no health benefits whatsoever."
positive,1/3/20,"Beats other brands by a mile. Love the taste, kinda earthy, milky smooth & has a straw like aftertaste that does not linger. High in Omega 3 & 6 too. But wonder why Amazon dealers sell over retail is mind blowing, especially on a case you'd expect a big discount. My local health food store has it for two eighty two a box."
positive,28/7/20,"Very tasty item, although I enjoy it more with some veggies, but overall great sauce, and quality product."
positive,13/5/20,"I'm not a ""tea snob"" and this tea taste GREAT!. Came fresh and packaged well and at a MUCH better price then the local tea shop and health food stores!"
positive,26/3/21,"If you're a fan of sweet or honey mustard, try this out. French's has a good line of various mustard flavors, and this doesn't disappoint. You get the tangy spiciness of mustard with an edge of honey, so for those of you who like a touch of sweetness in your condiments, this shouldn't disappoint you."
positive,29/8/19,"Five pounds of beans is a lot of coffee. The ""Dark Brazilian"" beans seem to sit somewhere between a columbian and french roast. The flavor is very nice and makes a nice cup of dark brew."
positive,7/2/21,"I've been drinking this coffee every morning for about a year now and really like it. The 5-pound bag lasts a while, so it's an excellent value. It smells wonderful when you first open it. I'm so glad to not be spending a fortune on grocery store coffees anymore."
positive,14/10/21,"I hate popcorn but I loved this popcorn. It's crunchy and sweet but not over-poweringly so. The seller delivered the product extremely fast and way before planned. I would surely buy this product again and from this seller again."
positive,7/8/20,"My 12 months old son love it, he loves all the favor. It is a MUST item in our diaper beg."
positive,1/3/20,Have to hide these from my daughter.  Very good!!  Fast shipping and a good price.
positive,28/7/20,"Of course, they can't really help how these taste, but I didn't much like it.  Maybe they're not ripened all the way?  I don't know.  But I know they're supposed to be good for me!"
positive,14/9/21,"If you like rice cereal and need gluten free, all the Erewhon brown rice cereals are really tasty!"
positive,17/12/20,"I like good coffee and have tried quite a few different coffee beans.  I have been very satisfied with the flavor of Cameron's Organic French Roast whole bean coffee.  Plus it is organic which is just a wonderful extra.  I certainly intend to keep buying this coffee if the flavor continues to be so good!"
positive,2/5/20,"We have tried many different whole bean french roast coffees. This is one of the better we have tasted. The fact that it is fair trade, organic and shade grown is a bonus"
positive,14/7/21,"This was quite yummy (I tried it) and also is nice and thick to help older babies learn to eat food with more texture. My son preferred this to apple sauce, which is about half as thick as this."
positive,18/7/19,Peanuts were shipped very quickly and I received them 2 days after placing the order.  They taste great and are exactly as described.
positive,1/3/20,I put these in one of those antique looking gum ball machines you can buy for your home.  The yummy hot cinnamon flavor has the perfect amount of heat and sweet.
positive,28/7/20,"This is my very favorite tea!  It has a nice, strong  blackberry taste.  A must-try for berry lovers like me."
positive,13/6/20,Nice flavor-not overly ginger-hot. Quick ship for a lower price than I have seen from others. I will order again
positive,10/3/20,"i forgot all about these fine treats...i think i will add them to my order...there are so many sugar free treats that dont seem sugar free and this is one of them...shaka sez check 'em out"
positive,9/5/20,"This is the best tasting soup I recommend this soup to anyone who has a head cold. After eating a bowl of this soup with mixed vegetables, cut cooked chicken breast my head cold was gone the next day."
positive,14/5/19,"I cannot have chocolate but can consume white chocolate. I was looking for something to add to my milk so I could have a change once in awhile. This product is very good tasting but doesn't mix to well in cold milk. I still use it though and enjoy the flavor!"
positive,19/10/20,"These things are great.  They never freeze solid, they're always slushly.  And each one is only 60 calories."
positive,1/3/20,"GoPicnic is a wonderful option for my college aged daughter.  She never really stops to eat, and when she does finally give into hunger it's usually not good food.  She loves the convenience of the packaging and the freshness of  GoPicnic.  I appreciate the nutrition in each package.  The new Salmon and Crackers is one of her favorites."
positive,28/7/20,"Without going into any of the actual health benefits, I'm just commenting on how tasty these bars are. Very chocolaty and delicious. I will definitely purchase these again."
positive,7/3/20,I love these!!!  Everyone with whom I have shared them agrees.  They are so satisfying I eat at least a bag a day.  I love the other crunchy cheese products but these are my favorite.
positive,4/8/20,"I had Tasty Bite Punjab Eggplant that I picked up from Target under 3 bucks; inexpensive and yummy.  Very similar to Kashk Bademjan I had at a local restaurant.  Great with some pita bread/chips, or raw carrots, etc."
positive,26/12/19,"I keep a few of these in my desk at work for days when I don't feel like going out to lunch. They are super convenient because you can microwave them as is, just tear open slightly to vent and put in the microwave. No bowl required, just a spoon, or in a pinch, tilt your head back and slurp it!<br /><br />The taste is great. I love Indian food, and I love vegetables so this is perfect for me. The only thing to mention is that one of my co workers complained about the smell, but he's that sorta complainy person who doesn't eat Indian food and prefers Burger King. It tastes great, smells great, and is super convenient."
positive,28/3/21,"I tried this today and it was delicious!  It's not the texture you at first expect from eggplant, the flavors bridge that, and are really great.  Next time I will put this over rice. : )"
positive,6/2/20,"I don't like plain coffee but even more, I don't need or like all the calories and fat that come with using flavored coffee creamers. Even the sugar-free creamers have a ton of fat, part of which is hydrogenated/partially hydrogenated.<br /><br />Flavor Blends for coffee are a wonderful alternative to fatty creamers. Easy to use and they come in portable small packages you can take with you anywhere. This is not a creamer but more a flavored ""sugar"". One packet gives a yummy, subtle hazelnut flavor but without being too sweet the way some things with Splenda are."
positive,25/4/21,"With no extra salt, it tastes a lot like fresh corn.  You can add the salt after if that is to your taste.  Everybody's will be different."
positive,3/8/20,"This is fantastic corn, you don't need to add a thing to it, it is perfect right out of the can. Of course a couple of the cans were dented, to be expected with shipping. I am just sure to use those quickly. Great price with subscribe and save."
positive,15/4/19,I love these.  They have a lot of flavor and no corn syrup.  Great product.
positive,9/3/18,"I got this item as a little gift to my little sister who loves Japan. She, my brother, mother, and I tried it and it tasted great."
positive,18/5/18,"For some reason I can never find grape flavor in the stores, so this was a treat.  My bro in law says I eat like a 3 year old - so what, when it's this tasty!"
positive,9/3/18,"Roasted to city/city+ and it is excellent.  Brewed in a french press, very aromatic while brewing, smooth flavor, some fruity tones.  I'll have to try some of the other green coffees from these folks, but will definitely purchase these again."
positive,27/2/18,"I love oatmeal cookies and have made them at least hundred times.  I love my cookies, but these come in a very close second to my under baked, soft homemade ""vanishing oatmeal"" cookies.<br />There's some ingredients in these cookies that I don't find in my kitchen cabinet, but if you're not against prepackaged food, it shouldn't bother you.<br /><br />I loved the allspice taste, but my guy friend didn't that much.  I think he's just partial to my cookies.  The individual serving size is nice.  I'm more apt to just have one cookie this way rather than opening a whole box and having to eat them before they get stale.  I could say that individually wrapping the cookie saves me from just having one more and one more and..........<br /><br />They are delicious and make me feel like I'm eating something that is somewhat healthy for me.  After all, there is oatmeal in the cookie."
positive,20/2/18,Love these cookies my Son asks me to heat one for him in the microwave for about 15 sec its soooo good that way gives it the freshly baked feel...I always make sure to keep in stock in my home...they are also individually packed do makes it easy to carry along in my bag
positive,22/3/18,"When I opened the packaging I was surprise to find one of the best tasting cookie I have had in a while. Not only did it taste great, the texture was perfect and it was fresh."
positive,12/3/18,"Received these in my Influenster box for Summer, taste great and very soft. Seemed to be a healthy alternative to regular cookies just concerned as to how much they will cost."
positive,9/2/18,These cookies are very tasty and soft! I received a complementary cookie in my mom vox box and will definitely be buying more!
positive,7/12/17,"I got this cookie as a part of my Mom Box from VoxBox. I'm not too keen on oatmeal cookies, but this one was surprisingly good. I guess I'm more used to them being hard so I really liked the soft chewiness of my cookie. Now a chocolate chip one would be fab!"
positive,24/5/19,"These cookies are Quaker baked, mom and kid approved. They are soft, chewy, and most of all delicious. The texture and taste makes them seem homemade without the hassle of baking."
positive,9/3/18,These cookies taste fantastic!  Even my picky children love them and ask for them every time we go to the grocery store!
positive,18/5/18,"These are some of the best oatmeal raisin cookies ever - I usually bake my own cookies but to be honest I'm not sure I can do better than these!  They are soft, melt in your mouth and bursting with flavor."
positive,23/3/18,"These were really good. I got them free to try and loved them. Very filling and tasty. Me and my husband shared it and we couldn't wait to buy more."
positive,8/9/20,These are very good. Nice and soft. Would for sure get again. Since they are packaged individually its nice for travel. A great snack.
positive,23/2/18,"The Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies may be the best oatmeal cookies you can eat that are not homemade.  They are well baked to the point had they spent another minute or two in the oven they may be burnt (which is exactly how I like my cookies).  And even though they are soft, they are firm enough they do not crumble in your hand.  And there is enough raisins you will have at least one or more in every bite.  On the flip side, the ingredient list is a bit lengthy with a few ingredients that I cannot pronounce (is a red flag for me)."
positive,18/7/20,"These quaker cookies are so great, they are easy to carry around and they make a great snack when you are on the run."
positive,14/6/18,Loved my Quaker cookie it taste really good and is very soft unlike them other hard cookies. I could eat a whole box of these. Yes they taste that good
positive,2/11/18,"These cookies are soft and delicious.  Possibly because they rely more on oat flour than just rolled oats, they lack the chewy texture of a traditional oatmeal cookie.  Instead they are almost melt-in-your mouth, with nicely soft raisins as well.  Perhaps the only truly detrimental characteristic is that they taste more like a raisin and spice cookie than an oatmeal cookie.  I enjoy the taste of oatmeal and wouldn't mind if it was brought more to the forefront.<br /><br />I don't usually buy individually wrapped food, so I don't think I'd buy this product again, but I would certainly recommend it to others."
positive,14/10/18,The first 12 were great the second 12 was spoiled But amazon contacted the supplier and shipped another batch so far they are ok.
positive,6/4/20,"Jelly Belly's have always been my secret vice. Now that I live out of the country I got this mammoth jar and it will last me more than a year. It came fresh and well sealed and right on time. Love the variety of flavors..yum."
positive,9/3/18,"These were really tasty, some might even say habit forming. The only thing is that they are a little expensive. My family loved them so I'll likely purchase them again."
negative,18/5/18,"Taste was average and I would not buy it again.  Since taste is personal, others may like it better."
positive,7/3/18,"This was a gift for my mom for mother's day.  She seemed to like it.  A lot of them all seemed to taste the same."
positive,24/1/19,"My wife found this coffee in a local grocery store and it is great tasting coffee. However, the local grocery quit carrying it and we were able to find it at Amazon. We started ordering and it has so far been a good experience."
positive,27/2/19,"The popcorn salt was an added, tasty treat to homemade popcorn...thanks for the prompt shipment."
positive,19/4/20,I really like lentils so I gave this a go. Good balance of veggies and lentils. A bit too salty though. Overall a great product. I would definitely buy again.
positive,17/4/20,"I eat this cereal almost every morning.  It has a great taste and texture.  I have been gluten- free for 7 months now and this is my favorite cereal.  I know that this is marketed for kids, but as I am 39 yrs old, I can truly say that adults live this cereal too."
positive,3/4/20,"Once we tried this fabulous spice mix for beef fajitas, we were hooked.  we use this spice mix everytime we prepare fajitas on both chicken and beef.  It is not too spicy so if you like real heat, you might want to add some cayenne pepper.  It is just right for us and allows the beefy flavor of the skirt steak to come through. It also does chicken proud.  We serve them on fresh flour tortillas."
positive,7/8/19,I like the fact that this capuccino is not that sweet. The taste is really good. I give it four stars because I like the Amaretto one even more...
positive,9/3/18,Great taste and goes with all types of mexican food.  Have used for years and all of a sudden this product extremely hard to find at grocery stores and Walmart.  So was pleased I could order and shipment was here quickly.
positive,18/5/18,"This steak rub is awesome. We have tried many different ones and came across this one in a grocery store. It quickly became our favorite. After that, we couldn't find it in any local stores so having the 6 pack is great."
positive,27/1/19,"These are excellent. I was worried they would taste too natural and not really like a cookie, kind of like the difference between Kashi cereal and normal cereal but they taste like any high quality Choc chip cookie and have the added benifit of being a little bit more healthy. Easier to justify than a pack of oreo's...<br />All in all a excellent product that arrived in perfect condition and I have a active once a month subscription for them, for the last 3 months."
positive,10/11/19,"This is the only store bought cookie I will eat. When it's Kashi, I know its healthy. Love the wholesome goodness of oats with the chocolate chips. This is a staple in my house. Treat yourself."
positive,8/11/19,"I had heard that champagne vinegar was good from TV CHEFS and cooking magazines.  I realize now just what I was missing. I highly recommend it.  You won't be disappointed.  A little goes a long way!"
positive,25/10/21,"To be fair, I have not tried this in my drip coffee maker, only the Bialetti Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Percolator.  The flavor is strong but smooth.  It's not as bitter/acidic as Starbucks (and I like Starbucks alot).  Definitely recommend for the Bialetti.<br /><br />P.S. The tins are nice too. Great for re-use around the house."
positive,8/5/20,"Nothing... and I mean absolutely nothing compares to these. Semi-hard chocolate shell outside and incredibly smooth chocolate inside. It's heaven in a box. Godiva DOESN'T EVEN COMPARE.<br /><br />The absolute best chocolate ever."
positive,28/9/18,"Cheese is great, just what we were looking for considering it is hard to find this product."
positive,29/7/19,My boys have severe allergies. This is something that they enjoy and are able to eat.<br />I love these because they are easy to pack on the go.
positive,9/3/18,"This honey tastes great, plus the fact that it is raw, and research indicates it may be useful in the healing of stomach ulcers is a bonus."
positive,18/5/18,"If you are looking for a tasty snack, look no further.  These caramel Fiber One bars taste like a cross between a candy bar and a granola bar.  The consistency is chewy, but not so chewy that it gets stuck in your teeth.  Since each bar provides 35% of daily recommended fiber, it's relatively healthy as well.  For those individuals that are on Weight Watchers, these bars are 2 points each... and well worth it.  I highly recommend this snack.  I also recommend the peanut butter Fiber One bars, although they are not quite as tasty, in my opinion.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z40U2"">Fiber One Bars Oats And Peanut Butter, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>"
positive,17/5/20,This apple butter has a great taste but the price is so I would not purchase again. I know it can not cost this much to produce such a small jar
positive,26/3/20,"these are very pricey so i only enjoy them now and then as a treat but the flavor is wonderfull and the packaging is very nice. would make a wonderfull gift to send to someone who likes such dainties.<br />i will order again when i run out, truly a nice treat."
positive,24/2/20,I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality. The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most.
negative,3/5/19,"I don't know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere, but they were so old that they wouldn't cook.  I had to throw half of them out, because the skins were damaged, a clear sign of dried beans past their prime.  I can't even return these or ask for a refund, because food is not returnable.  Will find a different brand to use.  For now, I have about fifty servings of beans to throw away."
positive,27/3/20,"The recommendation when we bought our puppies (lhasa/bichon mix and lhasa/poodle mix) was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned. This is a somewhat expensive food so I can't say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home.<br /><br />Let me just say this, I have had small dogs before. Never have I seen such gas issues. Both of them consistently had foul gas. Consistently. Usually when they're sitting on our laps but, you know. They're dogs.<br /><br />When we got through the first bag of this stuff, we purchased more on amazon. It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of (I think) a 15 lb bag at Petco. But, they continued to have gas. I mean, they loved the food, don't get me wrong and they loved it more when we'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food. Somehow that made their gas worse but I think I'll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down- can't blame the food itself for gluttony.<br /><br />Eventually, we switched their food. No more farting. I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies. They just need that in their diet. I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful (they said up until 1 year). Yeah right, you try dealing with gas for that long. Around 6 mos of age we switched to PuppyChow. Much better. Granted, they don't like it as much, but we humans like it a whole lot better."
positive,31/12/20,"Although there were several ""shriveled"" ones, they taste just fine.  I mostly use them to make vegan sauces and other recipes that call for running them through a food processor so they don't have to look perfect anyways.  For the price, they are a great deal (about half of what I find them for in the store)"
positive,13/1/20,"Just got this order and it is ok. A bit light on the cheddar flavoring and herb taste eludes me, if it is there."
positive,21/9/20,"Better than organic oats advertised elsewhere. Takes lots of water. These are not minute oats, so my oatmeal cookies come out right, not all crumbly and soggy. (Instant oats have their place, but not in cookies)."
positive,2/12/20,"I've used maybe half a dozen bags of this tea in the last year and it is a delicious, consistently good quality black tea. Mainly I use it and several other Numi teas in my tea blends for making kombucha."
positive,20/11/19,"The product is of high quality, and has a rich full flavor.<br /><br />Delivery was unexpectedly fast.<br /><br />The only negative I would like to see addressed is that the product is packed in a heavy paper sack. While this may be commonplace, a significant improvement would be to have an inner liner of a heavy weight, food grade, plastic bag that can be sealed after each time you open the bag.  Could be either a zip-lock bag or a twist tie closure... doesn't make any difference... just need a practical way to preserve the freshness of the product and keep the bugs out of it.<br /><br />This is a health and spoilage issue... 50#'s of oatmeal is a lot of product and needs to either be repackaged by the consumer in small food grade bags or containers (very expensive and hard to find}. I am a single senior who likes to buy staple goods in bulk to save money and provide food security.  Long term storage is a big issue with people like me.<br /><br />Thom (Missouri)"
negative,2/12/20,"I was extremely disappionted when I opened my shipment of Enjoy Life On The Go Bars (Very Berry, Carmel Apple, and Cocoa Loco). The boxes are now a plain, generic design..you know, the kind all brands change to when they want to make their products look cheaper. I then compared the ingredients of the new shipment with the older boxes I still had at home. Guess what?! Cheaper ingredients! Next, I taste-tested, and let my 3 year old help. He wouldn't eat the new ones...and I can't blame him. They are oily and bland. I thought Enjoy Life was a brand that actually cared about using quality ingredients to make a good-tasting product. I was wrong. In summary, these are way too expensive to be made with low-quality, unpalatable ingredients."
positive,11/12/19,"I previously tried other matcha products and was generally satisfied with the quality but not the price.  I decided to give Pure Matcha green and rooibos a try because the price seemed to be very competitive.  The quality of Pure Matcha's products surpasses that of all others I have tried- stays fresh, has a consistent texture and tastes great.  Both the quality and price are better than others that I have purchased for the same quantity.  I highly recommend Pure Matcha and will continue to purchase."
negative,20/11/19,"This product, described as organic raw cacao powder from Peru, is clearly inferior to all other raw cacao powder I have had.  The taste of this product is definitely not as good -- this product has a bitter, muddy, thin taste as compared to the fuller, richer taste of the real thing from other vendors.  As soon as I tasted this product, which is destined for the trash bag, I understood why it was cheaper than organic cacao from other vendors -- it is nowhere near as good.  Spend a few dollars more and get the real thing."
positive,28/6/20,"All of the Roland products are top quality.  Roland's caviar is the real deal, unlike some other brands that are really made from seaweed!"
positive,8/8/20,"My doggie really likes Newman's Organic better than some other dog foods pet and big-box stores sell. My budget doesn't like Newman's Organic as much as Harmony Farms. It's the compromise that keeps the doggie AND my budget happy.  Because he eats it heartily, I don't worry that he's getting enough high quality food.  Otherwise he won't eat his food and he'll graze in the trash seeking egg shells and bones to fill the void.<br /><br />There's no barfing, digestion problems or accidents. High Quality food means good digestion, a shiny coat, high energy, bright eyes and a good attitude WITHOUT tons of additional elixers, treats or vet bills. A definite cost effective WIN:WIN for doggie AND me.<br /><br />I've had great results with Newman's Dog Food that I orderd through Amazon BUT there's 5 pounds LESS for about the same price.<br /><br />Psst I'm not an organic fanatic, it's the nutritional value that counts for my fur baby and human kids!<br /><br />Update 3/26/2011: Noticed this has jumped to almost THIRTY BUCKS, will opt for Newman's Organic when the costs per pound are the same...my dog likes BOTH Harmony and Newman, my budget likes the one most cost effective at the time of purchase :)<br /><br />Update 5/17/2012: Last batch Of Harmony Farms I ordered had a rancid oil smell when I opened the bag and the pooch wouldn't eat it as readily as he has in the past. He wouldn't eat for a day and started checking out the trash. I subsequently purchased some canned and pouch foods, cooked brown rice etc as mix-ins to ""encourage"" him to make it through this pricey bag. Not sure how this is stored before it arrives to my home, BUT the Texas heat can make anything stale/rancid/yucky quickly. I probably should have called Customer Service but felt the replacement would have the same issue due to the HOT weather here. Definitely exploring hot weather alternatives."
positive,14/7/21,"No more heavy grocery bags for me -- I've just ordered my first bag of Harmony Farms dog food -- and it was delivered to my door by UPS.  The food is excellent quality -- I bought this product based on its healthy ingredients; the dogs love it and I love Amazon for making it so easy to buy!<br /><br />July 2010 - one of my dogs has had bouts of inflammatory bowel disease:  previously she had to have special food from my vet (Royal Canaan Duck & Potato for the past 4+years) -- She has tolerated, even thrived on, the Harmony Farms food w/o any problems. Each bag of Harmony Farms is about $20 cheaper than the Royal Canaan.  Hard to fight.  I am a believer.<br /><br />The canned food is great, too.<br /><br />September 2011 -- my dog who has had inflammatory bowel disease in the past (verified by surgery) has never felt better -- she is a wire and has the energy of a 2 yr old dog (she is 7); she is not on any daily medication.  This HEALTHY WEIGHT FORMULA has helped her to thrive.  Enough protein, not too much fat seem to do the trick. I highly recommend it."
positive,2/12/20,I love this TEA. It has a very smooth taste and not bitter like other kind of tea. I do agree that the string seems to come apart easily but I can live with that. No big deal! The quality of TEA makes up for that.
positive,20/11/19,I got two bags from my friend who got it from his friend who said it was primo. So I chucked them in a zip-lock when I got home. 3 mos. later I opened it and had some today. I am online trying to find more.
positive,1/3/21,"Had this sent to me in Afghanistan. The flavor was enjoyable but not to spicy. It is made with quailty ingridents. I would surely say this is one of the best salsa's I've ever had."
positive,5/5/21,"These are excellent quality flaxseeds! I just toasted them a little on a pan and even that made a great snack! I also powdered them in a coffee grinder after toasting them a little and the powder is delicious too :) Delicious + Nutritious = Awesome! :))) Planning to have it in my cereal tomorrow and maybe sprinkle some on my veggies. I think I will also try out Bob's Quinoa and Museli."
positive,2/12/20,"lots of uses for this green tea...<br /><br />I generally like most tea (though not the over-ally flowery blends)...<br /><br />Being on more of a health kick in recent years, I have added a lot more GREEN tea to my diet in one form or another...<br />from straight brewed tea &lt;> hot or iced...<br /><br />To adding the powder to things like salad dressings, smoothies, baked goods, etc.<br /><br />I am not new to green tea....as I first started drinking it when living in Japan some 30+ years ago....<br />in the ground form known as matcha.<br />A quality product. Dissolves well.<br /><br />I like both the unsweetened and the lightly sweetened."
positive,20/11/19,I like to put wild rice in many dishes. This is a good buy and easy to drop into other rice dishes or soups.
positive,9/10/21,"My 22-month old daughter has loved these ever since she started chewing her food.  They are tasty, healthy, and have zero additives.  On the downside, every few handfuls there is a pea that is as hard as a freaking ROCK.  I can barely crunch into it with my adult teeth, so I worry about what would happen if she really bites down on them with her baby teeth.  That being said, it's been months and nothing bad has happened...and it hasn't worried me enough to stop feeding her the peas, it's just something that I feel should be noted to those considering purchasing this otherwise excellent product."
positive,6/3/21,"i thot i was satisfied with the spring water i have bought elsewhere UNTIL i bought this brand! best i have ever tasted. no chemical aftertaste.  i have 2 cases a month delivered since i also use it for all cooking needs and ice cubes too. it is soooooo delicious when making a glass of lemonade from fresh lemons with the aforementioned cubes with agave sweetener. mercy! as others have stated, the ups man does all the hard work and i don't have to worry about running out of the most important staple in my household."
negative,12/2/21,this product taste stale and is full of artificial ingredients.<br />NO REAL PEPPERMINT IS IN THIS PRODUCT and to be honest it doesnt even taste like real cocoa is either.
positive,2/12/20,"I don't understand why this dog food is not full of reviews. Checkout [&#8230;] they give this dog food 4 out of 5 stars which beats science diet and purina one which I use to use and diamond natural is less expensive."
positive,20/11/19,"I don't review much, but I have been buying this brand for my Irish Wolfhound for over 2 years now.  He still loves it and it's good for him.  If you have a large breed dog, this dog food will be a good choice for healthy food."
positive,25/6/21,"this food gets an A rating compared to failing scores for many others in the price range. however, it's about $8 more here on amazon than at the local pet store (after a 9.25% sales tax)"
negative,17/3/20,"I have been purchasing this product for about 9 months.  The taste of the product is inconsistent from lot number to lot number. I have gotten 3 cases where the chips had no flavor at all.  Have contacted the manufacturer 2 times.  Have not received a response from my latest inquiry. I don't recommend purchasing."
negative,20/10/21,"I ordered this item on March 22nd.  I expect to get its replacement from the people at Blue sometime today.  So, what's a month, anyway?  The first one that came from Amazon had a constant, high-pitched tone.  I emailed, then called Blue, and eventually spoke to a pleasant tech support guy who was aware of the problem. He allowed that the company had shipped out a number of units with this defect.  That's always good to hear.  So, several emails later, I received a Return Merchandise Authorization, and shipped it right back to them.  Who knows, if this one works, maybe I'll like it.  Blue's products look good, but they make a strong case for buying locally."
positive,21/7/20,"Melitta's rich, flavourful product is a delicious treat comparable to coffees with a much higher price tag. It is a plus that the decaffeinated version does not sacrifice flavour. Highly recommended."
positive,22/2/21,"I'm a big coffee drinker (much against my better judgement), but due to a stomach condition, I've been ""forced"" to drink mostly decaf for the last few years. I usually just get the cheapest coffee I can find near my office; after all, I don't make a lot of money and every penny counts. So it was nice to get this Melitta Cafe ground coffee to sample.<br /><br />When I made my first cup, I was immediately attacted by the pleasant aroma. I put in a little cream and 4 Splendas as I usually do, and found the taste a little on the light side yet quite bitter. Maybe it's because this is decaf, but what I did like was its pureness, something 50-cent coffees usually lack. I have made two cups a day since my first taste and over the last couple of days I've grown to like this coffee. Granted, to me coffee is pretty much like wine in that all the different varieties taste more or less the same except for the level of bitterness, but even I can tell this is gourmet coffee, much better than the ones I get at my local coffee stands or even at McDonald's (when they give out free cups).<br /><br />For a pack of 3, the price seems decent. If you drink decaf, I think this is quite worth a try."
positive,8/6/21,"I love this tea!  Both the green and white varieties are quite consistently fresh.  I have ordered this at least ten times from various internet sites.  I didn't realize how old and stale tea from the grocery store was until I had this brand.  For organic tea, it is quite reasonably priced.  They recommend using two tsp. of loose tea per cup.  I use half that and it tastes great.  Never, ever bitter!  Very smooth tasting.  I highly recommend!"
positive,2/12/20,"I feel good about the quality and mix it with canned PN food.  She doesn't care for it by itself but then she doesn't like any dry dogfood."
negative,20/11/19,"We have been using Newman's organic dry dog food for over 5 years...it was a Godsend when we discovered it. Our little Jack had such severe allergies she was tormented day and night with unrelieved itching...after trying endless other avenues to find relief for her we were to the point we thought we might have to have her put down for her to find relief. Then the idea came up that maybe she had chemical sensitivities...so we decided to go organic...all her deals miraculously cleared up once we started the Newman's. However after giving glowing reviews for many years, we now have to concede something has changed...our little Jack's itching returned to the point of drawing blood. It is clear something changed and I believe it clearly is no longer as organic as it once was...we are on the hunt again. I am not saying it does not have good quality ingredients...but if you have a dog that is highly chemical sensitive...this likely is not for you. Too bad...it once was a superior product."
positive,25/1/21,Dogs love the taste and I love the company. Especially convenient to have it delivered rather than me lugging it home.
positive,1/7/21,"We were looking for an organic food after the melamine poisoning of pet food debacle. Newman's Own dry foods for cats and dogs are manufactured in the US per their corporate veterinarian. Newman's Own is up front about their ingredients. For an organic food it is affordable. Also it has been great at keeping skin issues under control. Lastly Newman's Own is listed as a ""More Responsible Pet Food Company"" on several websites."
negative,30/9/20,"I received these in bad condition. Most of them were broken, but the ones that weren't had holes in them. They were so weak that they would tear when you tried to roll them. I would try three ladies brand. They are a way higher quality."
positive,15/3/20,"These are beautiful, smooth spring roll wrappers and on the package label there is a sticker on each one that reads, ""New technology"", so, I'm figuring by the bad reviews that this company changed the way they manufacture their spring roll wrappers and have probably upped their quality control as well. I was nervous about ordering these by the bad reviews but I'm glad I took a chance because these are a bargain compared to some of the other brands.<br /><br />Will definitely order these again!"
positive,6/7/21,I use a lot of various spices in my cooking and wanted to find a source with a quality product at a reasonable price.  Frontier met that discription.
positive,29/6/21,"I've been feeding Wellness grain free for a couple years now with great results for my 3 cats. I believe the cost of a top quality food is well worth it in healthy, happy cats and reduced vet bills, but still the cost of Wellness has been prohibitive. I was excited to see Felidae had a grain free formula in the larger sized cans, and for a much lower price, so I am trying it. Just switched them over this week, so far so good. The bowls have been licked clean, and while I questioned the whole peas when I saw them, they weren't left in the bowl. The ingredients and quality of the Felidae seems comparable to the Wellness, so unless I find information indicating otherwise (and I've been looking), I think we'll stick with Felidae."
positive,29/6/21,"Happy with this purchase, it's a good deal. It's the most fragrant coriander ever! Coriander is a super spice, tri-dosha (and a health supplement as well, research it, it's a ground cilantro seed). We use it in lots of dishes.<br />Thank you!"
positive,26/7/21,"I've tried a number of high-quality canned cat foods to supplement the dry food my cats always have available to them, and these appear to be the best as judged by me and the cats.  For one thing, these actually look like fish.  You open the can, and there are large pieces of actual fish in the can, instead of the weird, mystery paste.  It pretty much smells like you've opened a can of real fish, too (not in a bad way, though I don't share my cats' love of sardines.)<br /><br />One of my two cats is a picky eater when it comes to canned food.  I picked up a can of each of the varieties from the local pet store when I wanted to try switching to Tiki Cat, and learned that the picky one will only eat the varieties that include sardines.  There are a few different sardine varieties, so at least it forces her to have some variety in her diet in case they stop producing one of them.<br /><br />The picky one has always been very excited about getting her daily quota of canned food, but the other cat seems way more excited about dinner time since we switched to Tiki Cat, so I take that as her endorsement of this positive review."
positive,21/10/21,"I wanted to give homemade vanilla extract as gifts and was extremely satisfied with these beans. They made very high quality extract and were much cheaper than at local grocery or organic food stores. I was mildly concerned by the size; I only needed 24 beans, and ended up with closer to 50. However, my brother has used the remainder to make delicious vanilla ice cream, creme brulee, tiramisu, custard, vanilla sugar, french toast, etc. I have recommended them to friends and family."
positive,25/10/21,"We've been using walnut oil for many years; we brush it on toast to take the place of butter, eliminating much of the saturated fat from our diets. It's also wonderful in salads--try it tossed into greens with a few nuts and chopped stone fruit or grapes, and a fruity vinegar. This product is of excellent quality and Amazon has a great price for it."
positive,29/6/21,It is hard to tell most of the time if supplements work but I just have a greater sense of well being when I take this product. It really is a good source for essential fatty acids. I expect to keep taking it.
positive,5/7/21,"I purchased this product for my goats initially. I like to give a warm drink of molasses water to my does after they kid and I also give a tablespoon full to any goat that seems to be feeling poorly. It seems to give them a good boost when they most need it. I bought an extra bottle for the house because I have always loved a bit of molasses on my biscuits. Much of the molasses, even that labeled blackstrap, that I have been finding in recent years is bland and seems to lack flavor. This molasses is quite delicious, if you like molasses, and is rich and flavorful. It also has high iron content, higher than I was finding in other brands."
positive,17/9/21,"Flour type 00 is better than regular flour.  Whether frying it or baking it, dough maintains softness and pliability.<br />I like it a lot."
positive,18/8/21,"Taste: Amazing. The honey flavor goes well with the smoked barbeque taste. It's soft, but not too soft. It also has a nice tang and spice to it, but nothing too extreme.<br />Smell: As soon as I opened it, everyone in my section ran up to see what the smell was. I'd describe it as alluring and inviting. Not overpowering or off-putting.<br />Price: For a pound of this quality of jerky, I'd expect it would cost more. Needless to say, you get more bang for your buck.<br /><br />In short, if you want a good jerky to snack on, you can't go wrong with this selection. Do your tastebuds a favor and get this jerky."
positive,31/7/21,"We are white popcorn enthusiasts, and were very pleased with this product.  Large, tender kernels of poped corn.  Used an electric, self stirring poper.  Worth the cost."
positive,18/10/21,Nuttzo makes great nut butters. Their chocolate version is like Nutella should be--less sugar and other crap. Delicious and super-nutritious.
positive,29/6/21,"Our family really enjoys this shells and cheese. I love the convenience of Mac and Cheese, but usually the flavor is horrible. Annie's tastes great and is better for you. Can't beat that."
positive,16/9/21,"My son asked for this plant for his birthday and he is very happy with it.  It seems to be doing well thus far, hopefully it will continue to thrive.  It was packed well in the box and incurred no damage during shipping."
positive,24/8/21,"A brother in a Sicilian family who owns an Italian Food Market & Deli here in San Diego, tipped me off to this product over a year ago.  The difference it made in salads and vegetables, sauces and meats was unbelievable.  There is a pleasingly clean, peppery bite that makes it distinctive, adding a bold delicious flavor to fresh salads, cooked vegetables and roasted chicken and meats.  I've tried many other brands of extra virgin, pure, select or other types of olive oils growing up in an Italian household and in my 66 years, none of them stimulated the taste buds with the savory satisfaction delivered by Academia Barilla Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  The product is not widely known but the laboratories at Academia Barilla in Italy have developed as good a commercial product as is currently on the market and in my opinion, it is the very best.  The cost is high but consistent with the higher end oils.  But, if you enjoy fine foods and preparing aromatic dishes, simply put,  this oil turns them into a gift.  Use it and enjoy the satisfying reaction and comments of dinner guests as they realize they are being treated to a very special dinning experience.  Quality makes a difference."
positive,24/6/21,"I especially like like this on <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052ONATM"">Lydia's Organics, Kale Krunchies, Mega Green, 3 oz (85 g)</a>.  I empty the kale into a container, sprinkle on habanero powder, put a lid on it, and then turn it over and over to mix the two.  Wow.  I've heard it's great with popcorn, too.  Whatever you do, just be careful how much powder you use.  I've been in a world of spicey hurt more than once :)"

positive,29/6/21,"My cats love the food, and it's on the HAPPY list of ""Companies that Don't Test on Animals"" linked through the PETA site, peta.org.  That is VERY reassuring."
positive,5/8/21,"I feed prowl because it is a high quality healthy food that does not break my budget.  It is much cheaper than other premium wet foods (Wellness, Weruva, etc), and my cat seems to like it.  The only downside to prowl is that, since it is dehydrated, you must mix it with water and wait 10 minutes before serving.  My kitten meows at me the entire time.<br />I started my cat on Prowl because my vet offered a free sample. She ate it right away with no problems.  However, she'd only ever had ""healthy"" food, so I was not transitioning from an unhealthy grain filled (but addictively tasty) food.<br />It is very easy to digest and may be a solution for cats with digestion problems.  I recommend (like another reviewer) that you order a free sample and give it a try."
positive,29/6/21,"Nice alternative if you can't find them locally.  Great gift for the avid cook."
positive,31/7/21,"Chia seeds are a great, healthy food to add to your diet. I make chia gel by mixing them with water (1/2 C. per tablespoon of seeds), then stir the gel into yogurt, oatmeal, smoothies . . . it's flavorless and the seeds have a pleasant crunch. This brand is high quality and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it."
negative,11/9/21,"I bought Nutiva organic chia seeds before, two pouches 14 ounces each - $16.24 with tax, this brand in one 16-ounce pouch $14.83. The quality and the taste are the same, but the latter one is WAY much more expensive. Buy Nutiva Organic Chia seeds, not Navitas. In terms of the taste, I usually toast mine and add them everywhere - cereal, yogurt, oatmeal, etc. Tastes great and full of fiber."
positive,12/8/21,"This is a good product and very high-quality. The majority of people who post on Amazon (and the internet) are not medical providers and are not the least bit inclined in the area of sciences or infant nutrition. There's a large amount of misinformation out there and the misinformation is evident and propagated throughout the reviews for this formula. As for this product specifically (Similac Organic), it is the top echelon of quality with regard to consistency and nutritional value. We've had great success with this product and are very pleased overall as an adjunct to breastmilk. Abbott labs (product maker) is a very large research reagent laboratory for the medical sciences and they have very rigorous quality controls in-place, published research, and they also provide reagents to the scientific research community (exacting standards). That said, I would be less inclined to trust some of the other small makers of formula (ie. other organic products suggested as ""better"" in these reviews - especially the referenced small-name organic powders). All said and done, the components in ALL of the Similac products are the highest quality and monitored with advanced scientific protocols and are well-researched in published studies. I'd trust this brand - Similac, over the smaller, no-names. Plain and simple. Keep in mind it's what best suits your baby and with nascent/developing GI tracts, ALL babies will experience some degree of gas and discomfort regardless of the formula or nutritional source (even breastmilk). It's sad to see people in these reviews propagating misinformation as they are neither pediatricians/physicians. Do your own research and best to avoid those with ulterior motives, as well as the misinformative reviews and internet blogs that are overly slanted or biased."
positive,31/7/20,"Thought I'd take a chance on this, as my grocery store does not know about maple syrup grades (light amber is best).  Price is beautiful -- grocery store charged as much for two 8-ounce bottles as this whole quart.  Shipping time was amazing -- super saver in 1.5 days -- and yum!  Reminded me that it's been years since I bought a 3-pound box of maple sugar candy...  Time to search again... &lt;grin><br />Forgor to mention -- definitely grade ""A"" Fancy -- not grade ""B"" (the cooking grade).<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HI556E"">Hidden Springs Maple Vermont Maple Syrup, 1 Quart - Fancy Grade - Light Amber</a>"

positive,31/7/20,"I eat a mix of this along with the [ASIN:B000E4ALF6 Nature's Path Organic Heritage Flakes Cereal, 32-Ounce Bags] nearly every morning.  This is good healthy food unlike the popular sugary cereals most Americans eat.  I enjoy the taste, and it doesn't leave me starving by mid morning.  The price is also more reasonable when I buy it by the case."
positive,13/6/20,These beans are a good find as none of our local stores carry any dried pink beans!
positive,26/9/20,"I really enjoyed this product. It tastes good and is very close to the Russian or Iranian versions. Also, the service and quick delivery were an added bonus.  I would highly recommend this product."
positive,17/10/20,"I was very pleased with the shipping of this item. When I thought it was going to arrive after my food was empty, it had actually come 2 days prior.  My dog couldn't be happier"
positive,14/12/20,"My family makes a lot of ice tea during the summer.  We are not able to find affordable/quality loose tea in our community.<br /><br />Lipton's loose tea is the best!"
negative,29/5/20,"Lipton does taste good but it's not a good quality tea! If you open the tea bag you'll see their not tea leaves but tea dust (cheep). Even the loos lipton tea is described as being ""broken down so you need a fine filter to strain it."" When you steep good tea it should unfurl and look like spinach!<br /><br />They say this tea comes to $0.57 an oz?!?!?! Lets do the math. $27.54 devided by 8oz = $3.44.<br />I buy my tea from Set to a Tea [...]). It's really good tea with flavoring and dried fruit pices. It comes to $3 an oz for a tin or $2.57 for a refill. Weather you buy it loose or in bags you get the same quality tea! I went to a tea party last year (like a tupperware party but more fun) where the chick told us all about the different kinds of tea and gave us samples."
positive,9/12/20,"I need to watch my sodium - but I'm not really a fan of salty foods in the first place.<br /><br />These almonds are perfect, at half the salt.  I would prefer them over the regular salted almonds any day!  I have no idea why anyone would want to put MORE salt on these delicious nuts.<br /><br />The three-count 16-ounce bags (with Prime shipping) pop on and off of Amazon - buy them when they are available.  Otherwise you must buy the six-pack of small cans, at a higher price per ounce."
positive,4/8/20,The steaks came well sealed and packaged and were delicious. The price was right too for the size and quality of steaks that came.  I would recommend getting this product for the gourmet food lover in your life.
positive,31/7/20,I am happy with my purchase. The mushrooms are mostly whole and have a quality shroomy smell to them (not old and dusty in other words).
positive,13/6/20,"I bought Himalayan Organic Salt twice. Each time, quality was really good and service was fast and courteous (The Spice Lab's). I will buy it again."
positive,21/11/20,"So much better than other protein products in drugstores or even GNC. Taste great and doesn't fill up like other shakes do so you can work out after quickly. Relatively cheap for all the good things you get with it."
positive,25/5/21,"I live overseas and bought this for a friend living in the USA who just had a baby recently. I wanted to make an impression by sending her and her husband a nice present but not the usual (clothing, toys, etc). I decided to go with flowers but wanted to make sure they were the very best. I reviewed other roses suppliers and found out that Spring In The Air actually cuts the roses directly from the farm in Colombia and ships them right away via FedEx, while others are just waiting for orders to come in and their inventory is sitting in a warehouse somewhere in the USA.<br /><br />With that said I was sure that my roses were going to live even longer. Probably a week or two more, compared to other roses bought at Amazon. In addition, for the price my bet was that they were going to be top quality. So I gave them a try.<br /><br />The results: they exceeded my expectations and raised the bar. Firstly their communication goes far beyond usual Amazon sellers, they keep you posted on how your order is doing (received, being processed and sent) plus they give you instructions in order to guarantee long life of the flowers (nice) and also advise on how to proceed if nobody is available to receive the roses when FedEx first attempts to do so.<br /><br />I wrote to the seller to see if I could have a change in the from-to card I initially sent in my order and they answered promptly and nicely upon my request, even on a weekend.<br /><br />Roses arrived when promised and an hour later I was receiving a phone call from my friend and her entire family saying how beautiful there roses were, how fresh they look and that they had never seen roses with that outstanding quality. I was relieved. The plan worked perfectly!<br /><br />Thank you Spring In The Air. I will surely buy from you again. Please keep up the good job, great service and outstanding roses you have."
positive,25/5/21,"Ghee is more than an indulgence. Ghee can be viewed as an essential vitamin supplement (albeit, one that tastes really good). Ghee is especially necessary in a vegetarian diet in my opinion, but it can be a healthy addition to any diet.<br /><br />Some research shows that ghee can even lower cholesterol.<br /><br />I performed an extensive survey of the top ghee products available. I compared quality and value. Ghee is so important as an addition to the diet that quality should not be sacrificed -- especially because only a very small amount of ghee needs to be used.<br /><br />The ghee comparison table can be found at this blog: [see link in comment]<br /><br />When I started this ghee comparison, I was primarily interested in finding the best value in organic ghee products. However, I learned that several of the products go well beyond just organic standards. It was a very pleasant surprise to find out that such high quality ghee products are available. It is also great to see that my two top picks are both available on Amazon.com. (Grass Fed Organic ghee is one of those top picks.)<br /><br />Because such high quality ghees are available, I focused on understanding which product is the most authentic. Some of the ghees are much more authentic than others. The information in the table (link above) reflects that fact.<br /><br />The focus of my evaluation was not gourmet cooking. It was optimum health. Therefore, I was concerned first with which ghee product is the healthiest.<br /><br />I rank Grass Fed Organic ghee as one of the very best products. Grass Fed Organic ghee is made in accord with the ancient traditions (such as phase of the moon, chanting, etc.). It is a great quality, great tasting product. And the good price makes it a great value. I highly recommend this ghee."
positive,20/1/21,"This is a high quality Ghee , superior tasting and above all made from grass fed cows' milk and certified organic by the USDA.<br />  We use it over lentils ,  eggs , sauteed veggies , quinoa , rice , you name it and we use it.  Tried it on whole grain toast too...YUMMY !! Being from grass fed cows' milk , it is rich in CLAs and boosts immunity and energy and is known to fight and obesity , especially trimming the waistline. This is my second time buying this and I am a consumer for life. I also introduced it to my friends and they are digging the taste.<br />  I really hope AMAZON continues to sell this product  ( prime delivery really makes it all the more special ).<br /> Please try it for getting healthier and also the incredible taste.  Highly recommended."

positive,10/2/21,If you love chiles then ancho powder is a must have for any blends you may create. I recommend with chipotle powder. Try different peppers in different amounts for amazing results.
negative,9/10/20,"When I received this item, I was very disappointed with it. It is rather cheap looking and I wouldn't want this on my counter for all to see. The left side of the tray was lopsided and looked strange when you pulled it out. Needless to say I boxed it back up and sent it back for a full refund. Definitely not worth $25.00, but after seeing it I would have been equally disappointed had I paid only $10.00."
negative,31/7/20,"I had been buying these treats for my cavachon for the past two years. He loved them.<br /><br />The last batch was of noticeably lower quality...dry and crunchy rather than moist and chewy. I don't know if this is due to the shift in manufacturing from the US to China or coincidental. In any event, I will not be buying these any more and have switched to other treats.<br /><br />Note, Amazon would not let me return this item, and I am within the 30 day purchase period. I'm not pleased."
positive,13/6/20,"I love this tea. It's delicious and is one of my favorite teas. I like its aroma and taste. I drink it both after and between meals. Highly recommended."
positive,5/12/20,"I think these taste pretty good. There are lots of nuts & and a few raisins in these slightly bigger than bite sized cookies. You get 54 cookies for the price, so it is sort of pricey but they use quality ingredients so it is probably worth it."
positive,1/11/20,"I asked my brother, who is a chef, how he felt about the quality of the product he received and if he could recommend it to anyone. His comments were that quality was excellent and he would enjoy having it again in the future as a gift. He looked at the idea of buying something similar from Hickory Farm in the Mall where he lives since Mother's Day caught him and me by surprise since it arrived a week early this year and he came to the conclusion that this product was far better product than anything he could find in the Mall. I had thought Hickory Farm would work since he would have physical access to viewing any items from them and his comment was that Wisconsinmade, this company whose product I am reviewing, did a far better job in quality and produce. I think that says it. For those who see only volume and not quality, stay with the grocery store, it will give you lots of volume if that is your criteria.  I will note that I bought a couple of these products from this company and I have copied the same review to each so that people will know that this company has excellent quality.  Quality cheese and quality sausage is expensive and this company makes it well."
positive,14/1/21,"We feed Solid Gold food, to our dog, on a rotating basis.  For SOME dumb reason, our local pet store doesn't carry the Sun Dancer.  SO, we were glad to find it on Amazon.  We think the Solid Gold company makes one of the best dog foods on the market, today.  Oh, yes.. dog loves it, too."

positive,21/7/20,"Good quality Rose Petal Powder at a very good price!  I'm using it as a face and body scrub, as well as a mask.  It can be used alone, or it mixes well into argan oil or any liquid soaps and lotions.  Also highly recommend the vendor; the shipment was exactly as ordered and arrived in a reasonable time."
positive,5/1/21,"This is, at $1 a can, the most expensive cat food that I've purchased.  It seemed overly expensive to me - at first.  the cans are pretty and are only three ounces.  At first, again, that didn't seem like much to me.  But, my preconceived notions went out the window when I saw how my cats loved it.  The pair of kittens kindly took turns eating from one can, but, they scarfed it down and came and begged for more.  The adult cats each have been given one can a day.  These cats NEVER growl at one another, but, when they're eating Petite Cuisine, they growl when another approaches.  They finish each serving, inhaling it like the nectar of the gods.  I'm ashamed that I'd never given this to them before and, despite the somewhat pricey bottom line and small cans, I think that this is one of the most phenomenal gifts that my cats have ever been given."
positive,23/1/21,"These peppercorns were visibly of much better quality than we'd gotten other places before, and the aroma was tantalizing before we even opened the package!  They arrived fresher than I've ever tasted peppercorns in my life, and the seller is very professional and quick with shipment.  Highly recommended!"
negative,31/7/20,"Material is very thin and the shirt had several spots where the color was faded.<br />The only thing that it had going for it was the fact that it was cheap, but I guess sometimes you get what you pay for."

positive,1/12/20,"I bought this organic pumpkin online because it is impossible to find pumpkin locally. I feed my dogs this every day because it is wonderful for their digestion. Pumpkin was recommended by my vet.  All of the cans were in great condition. There were just a few minor dents on a few of the cans, not anything serious. The quality of the pumpkin was so good that I would serve it to my family, but we really do not eat pumpkin!  An added plus was free shipping.  I would buy this again."
positive,30/1/21,I was worried after ordering this product since so many reviews complained about dented cans but I ordered when the price was right and took the chance. Out of 12 cans only one was dented. The expiration date on the cans I received: 2014. Very happy with the quality of this pumpkin.
positive,1/1/21,my dogs are doxies they love them the larger sizes the seem to be good for them and they love them
positive,11/1/21,My parents were very satisfied with the steak and I was happy with the delivery time.
negative,31/7/20,"I go through a lot of coconut milk and this is the only brand I'll buy because Native Forest is the only company I know of that uses BPA free cans.  However the product is very inconsistent.  Sometime I get wonderful rich thick coconut milk and other times its watery, curdled, and gritty.  The watery stuff does not do well in my recipes at all.  I saw other reviewers said it has to do with whether the cans came from Sri Lanka or Thailand.  I will not be ordering these from amazon.  Even though it is more expensive at the store, I want to be able to make sure I'm getting the thick coconut milk.  It's really unacceptable that two completely different products are being sold as the same product."
positive,13/6/20,"The salt is great quality and taste - if you haven't already stooped using table salt (Sodium Chloride) I urge you to read about the benefits of using Himalayan salt - not only does it taste better - it is much better for your health."

positive,7/7/21,"Good product that we are all accustomed to at a very reasonable price. I do have to be cautious to not over salt when using this, so I tend to use more fresh garlic, and add this in lieu of salt in equal quantities."
positive,18/6/21,"I love the bitter taste of chocolate, so I did some research on cocoa and found mostly positive reviews of raw cocoa. I did however find one negative review saying that theobromide, the primary stimulant in cocoa, is unhealthy and has similar side-effects as caffeine. I got the powder anyways to dispel the mystery myself. While I did have a small crash afterwards (after 3 tablespoons), the surge in energy that I felt was definitely worth it. It was not the jittery surge I was warned about, and the crash actually helps me sleep if I time it right. Not to mention the taste is so good (and yet mild) that I could eat it by the spoonful on its own. Thinking that was the end of it, I also ordered cocoa nibs. Terrible mistake. I don't know exactly why, but I got the exact side-effects I was warned about, not to mention the energy was lower in quality. This is definitely the better alternative."
positive,7/7/21,"There is a lot of variability in the quality of macadamians, even from the same producer.  I've only received one bag of these, but they are perfect.  I've run across many that have had varying degrees of bitterness, usually accompanied by an unnaturally hard consistency, as though they had been harvested too early.  Not these.  They have perfect consistency and flavor.  The vast majority are whole as opposed to halves or smaller pieces.  [Update:  I've now ordered about 8 bags over a period of about a year.  The quality has be consistently excellent.}<br /><br />I use macadamia nuts as a regular part of my diet.  They preferentially reduce bad cholesterol due to their high content of monounsaturated fats.  They are low in carbs, and have very few simple carbs, so they will not only take the edge off your appetite, they will help keep it off.  Unlike most nuts, they are low in oxalate, which means regular use will not increase the risk of kidney stones.  (Pistachios and walnuts are also low in oxalate.)  The only catch is that their high healthy fat content means high calorie count per unit volume.  To dodge that bullet, I just ration them out as opposed to absentmindedly eating from a large container.<br /><br />This is a great product.  I'm happy to give them yet another 5-star review."
positive,1/7/21,"Best quality oil I've encountered.  I was impressed with the packaging for shipping.  Nice job."
positive,7/7/21,"Great culinary cooking. Got it with a lavender cook book and have been impressing my friends with the gentle, subtle flavor of the lavender. A little goes a long way and there is a lot of lavender here so it can easily be used for all sorts of dishes. Makes a great way (with a little sugar) to brighten up a lavender Margarita -rim the glass with the crushed lavender instead of salt."
positive,23/7/21,"I purchased this Lavendar for my daughter's BumbleBee themed baby shower to make Lavender Honey Scones. Which I did, and they were a huge success, there were no leftovers! But then I got creative and exploded with lavendar recipes. Our favorite so far has been a roasted pork loin on the grill. Yum!"
positive,20/7/21,"I grew up in an Italian household and this was the only pasta my father would cook with. It was always available in the grocery store on the east coast when I lived there. I rarely see it where I live now in the mid west. When I do it is outrageously priced and a very limited selection.  I love this pasta and ordering it online is cheaper and easier than going out to the store. I also use subscribe and save which reduces the price even more and there is no shipping cost. It is a staple in our house.  The quality is excellent.  Cooked as directed the pasta holds its form and texture.  It doesn't become mushy or fall apart.  Even if you like your pasta soft and not ""Al Dente"" it holds in shape."
negative,19/7/21,"The packaging was intact and all but when I opened the box I found that the greenies were stuck together and wouldn't break apart (even when I tried smashing them against the concrete). At some point they must have been moist that they had become so cemented together.  It is a struggle trying to pull one at a time out of the bag and they break apart. Not exactly what I wanted."

negative,27/6/21,"I ordered this product for my niece as one of her Christmas presents. When I opened the UPS package, the handle to the gingerbread box was broken. The box was also dented in places. The taste of the icing was horrible. However it was a fun project and none of the gingerbread pieces were broken. Would not buy again."

positive,7/7/21,Product was clean and in a good package.  As I could not find this item locally I looked to Amazon.  Price seemed a touch high except I have not shopped mung dal recently and that might not be fair.  In any event I was glad to get it anyway.  I purchased it with tumric spice also and was impressed by the packaging on both items.  These people seem to take care of their products.

positive,1/7/21,"I bought this stuff at my local co-op. I've used a lot of coconut oils and this brand is my favorite. I'm a coconut lover so I get the whole kernel version, but there is a lighter version as well. I use this oil for my skin, cooking, baking, and just eating plain. It's good stuff."
positive,24/8/21,"The small can in which the olive oil is stored are very handy and does perserve the fresh flavor of this very good oil. The quality<br />of this oil is high enough to use it as a dipping sauce, especially when mixed with fresh herbs."

positive,18/6/21,"I may not be a culinary expert, but I know taste.  This basil has a more intense and better flavor than I had experienced with any other dried basil.  I highly recommend it."
positive,7/7/21,This syrup is really good. It has a lot of flavor without being overly sweet. One or two pumps is enough to give my espressos a rich butterscotch flavor. I would recommend it if you are looking for a syrup that will compliment your concoctions without overpowering it with sugar.
positive,15/7/21,I am a Kinder Chocolate fan from way back and it is hard to come by in the US. But this shipment was fresh and arrived timely. Way to go.
positive,11/7/21,This is a staple in our gluten free household.  It is great for converting non gluten free recipes to gluten free recipes and getting good texture.  Easy to use.  I am very happy to have found it.
positive,7/10/21,"Not only is this a great deal, but the pineapple is delicious. Emerald does a great job, and each piece looks great and is nice and juicy.<br /><br />I would just warn people to be aware of the sugar content, because there is 20g per serving."
negative,6/7/21,"I had purchased the premium variety of these treats when Costco carried them, and my dogs loved them.  I bought the original recipe  treats here because the premium was too expensive.  What I recieved was a bag filled with broken and crumbled pieces and a lot of dust (Amazon shipped it thrown in with several books, with no padding around it). One of my dogs flatly refuses to eat the treat pieces (the other dog would eat sawdust if I offered it to him), which makes me think they have gone bad.  Since I cannot find a use-by date on the package, I do not trust that this is a wholesome, safe product.  the remainder has gone into the rubbish.  For the safety of your animals, I advise that you not purchase these from Amazon.  I believe they sell old product."

negative,27/7/21,The quality of these cups were awful.  Several of them broke open in my keurig brewer and leaked grounds into my coffee. This has not happened with any other brand of k cups.
positive,13/7/21,These nuts came very fast and their freshness is very good.  I use them to make a vegan whip toping.
positive,13/9/21,"This seller consistently provides high quality edibles for very reasonable prices, and this Fleur de Sel is no exception.  Extremely tasty, well packaged, and timely delivery."
positive,7/9/21,I think this is what salt is supposed to taste like. Mild and not biting ~ it gives food a more subtle flavoring. Very nice.
positive,17/4/21,"Purchased these for my husband who loves to use maple syrup in his oatmeal.  They are small, but nice, and by the time you've used one up, don't need to worry about sticky buildup.  These would be great for taking on trips or camping.  There are 3 of them and they are encased in opaque plastic and pour very well.  We love the quality of the flavor.  Good maple syrup is pricey these days, yet I think the cost in comparison to other high quality syrups is competitive.  I would purchase again."
negative,10/3/21,"Some of the cinnamon sticks have patches of mold. Other sticks smell like smoke, not cinnamon.  Previous orders were okay, but this batch will be my last purchase of this brand.  Grocery stores sometimes pull questionable products from the shelves until quality issues are resolved with the supplier. There needs to be an equivalent online response."
negative,17/4/21,"I have long haired dachshunds which like to dig out.  In the beginning the fido 525cs worked but was not powerful as it would not shock through the long haired coat of my dachshunds. They had to hit it with the face or shorter haired (skin exposed) underbelly areas in order to get a good reaction on them. I had the fido 525cs set up for maybe 2 months before it stopped working completely and the dogs were back to getting out again.  No, it did not get wet as my husband built a wood box for the charger ""house"" of protection.  It just stopped working and by that time I had thrown away my receipt which was from a small garden center on an old type register so that it didn't list the product name anyway.  Thus no warranty proof nor refund available.<br /><br />I am looking for a better quality charger which will hit harder through the long haired coat. I have had stronger chargers which worked better and lasted longer than this model the fido 525cs."
positive,21/1/21,"This most definitely is a green tea of superior quality. It is economical in that its yield is a bit stronger than average - one needn't double up bags to get a decent flavour."
positive,30/1/21,This item comes securely packaged in three separate bags. The quality is a good value for the price.
positive,13/2/21,Gluten free corn thins are incredibly tasty and low in calories. They are a good replacement for bread or any crackers.
negative,15/1/21,"Unfortunately, I believed that by looking at the packaging, I was getting the OLD style gum, which has a lesser chance of sticking to the paper when carried in my pocket for a few days, than the new cheap gum.  I loose more gum now because it sticks to the paper after I've carried it in my pocket for a few days.  The old gum was less likely to stick to the paper under the very same conditions.<br /><br />Needless to say, I am quite dissapointed in Wrigley's decision to CUT the quality of their Doublemint Gum.  And also, needless to say, this will be my last purchase of ANY Wrigley's products.  They had a good gum before.  ""If it ain't BROKE, don't fix it."""
negative,6/3/21,"The first time I ordered this, it was great.  After adjusting my grind, it made the perfect espresso with a thick crema.  However, subsequent orders left much to be desired.  Some were OK... Some were horrible... None were great."
positive,8/6/21,"I was pleased when Amazon decided to sell Community Coffee since I long ago decided it was the best of the rich, strong flavored Louisiana coffees.  The private reserve coffees Community Coffee sells are quite good, just as I remembered them being when I lived in Baton Rouge many, many years ago.  Community Coffees offer a consistently rich, flavorful roast.  The price is reasonable especially with Amazon's subscribe and save program.  I make my own blends of Sumatran, French Roast, Columbian and Espresso and am very happy with the results."
positive,7/1/21,The product was recieved in a timely manner. The product was in good condition and the item was in good shape.  Quality was good. Great price
negative,17/4/21,"I bought this product from Target after I had done what I thought was enough research on baby food makers.  I was originally going to get the baby bullet, but the reviews were not good at all so I went with the brezza instead.  Mistake.  I remember that a few people had written about the poor quality and bad customer service (of the company itself, not amazon).  When I opened it, the tape used to secure it within the plastic bag was melted so there was sticky stuff all over the bottom of the thing.  I had to scrub it as soon as I took it out of the box, after it had gotten sticky melted tape all over my kitchen counter.  That was annoying. The plastic covering over the buttons looked like it was lifting (as if it had been used or something...even though it was brand new).  I tried the motor and it worked, it wasn't terribly loud, I'd probably rate the noise a 4 on a 1-10 scale.  When I went to wash it (prior to first use of course), the directions said to remove the driveshaft prior to washing.  It said all you had to do was to turn the canister over, find the knob, and turn counter clock-wise.  That driveshaft must've been welded in there bc it took me and my husband over an hour to loosen it enough to get it out of there.  I was honestly scared to put it back in for fear that I'd never get it back out again!  I got over it and prepared to make my first meal (carrots).  I followed the directions and cut up the carrots to the appropriate size but when I went to put the water in, there was a discrepancy.  The directions said to put in ""160ml of water"" and that the canister had a premeasured line that could be used so the amount of water would be correct.  Normally that wouldn't be a problem...except that the measured line read 180ml.  Seriously?!?  So, I'm left trying to figure out which one is correct.  I ended up going with the premeasured canister...and I think that it was too much water bc the carrots came out ridiculously watery.  There were also still chunks of carrot in the mix.  It wasn't easy to get the food out around the blades, either.  I can see how people would say that it might be a time saver.  If it worked and was of decent quality then it WOULD save time.  You just set it and walk away.  But the end result leaves much to be desired.  And for the price, you'd expect to at least get your money's worth.  You're honestly better off just getting a really nice food processor and going the old fashioned way."
positive,10/3/21,"This curry powder has a nice well-blended flavor.  And, it is hot without being too hot. It adds a nice variety to many of my dishes, espeically fried rice which I eat quite often."
negative,14/1/21,"This candy had previously been melted.  Candy was stuck to wrappers.  This would be OK to eat, but not to share with friens."
negative,24/5/21,"I have always enjoyed Timothys coffee, however the quality of this box was unacceptable. Out of 50 K cups 16 failed while brewing, coming loose at the edge and making a huge mess on my counter top. I will not be purchasing this brand of coffee again."
positive,14/10/21,"These were freakin awesome. All 10 LBs were top quality, and better than many restaurants.<br /><br />Ordering my second batch now.<br /><br />How I prepare them: place several legs in a pot of boiling water for about a minute, or less if you stir em.<br /><br />They are already cooked so you just want to heat them up. Cooking them further will ruin them. The end piece will piece will take a bit longer."
positive,7/2/21,"Love this stuff. I use it for everything. Awesome in the kitchen (especially in brownies!), great in the bathroom for a hair mask. I buy this all the time!"
positive,29/3/21,This is an excellent product and a good price...I have been using coconut oil in most of my cooking now...
positive,17/4/21,"Good packaging, fresh product, received befor scheduled date. These are my favorite potato chips since I was a little girl. I cannot find them anywhere in my region of the state, so ordering them from Amazon was my only option. They did a great job I am totally satisfied.."
negative,10/3/21,"I am always looking for healthy treats for my dogs. I had ordered 2 boxes of these and when I opened the first box something had eaten their way in or out. The treats were full of holes and there were also holes in the plastic. I could not see from the outside any evidence of something getting in. They were also out of date by a couple of months. I contacted the the people that I purchased these from and they wasted no time in giving me a refund. I was very please with the seller's response."
positive,10/7/21,"This is a quality product that my dog adores.  I like it because I can make a little or a lot.  We use this to supplement kibble as she is not on a raw diet.  I used to make food or use a high quality can food, but find the Addiction to be a lot more convenient.  Besides that, I don't like the smell of can food.  This comes in plastic bags that you cannot reseal, so be prepared to transfer to an airtight container."
negative,27/1/21,"I LOVE these strawberries, but this batch came up short on flavoring. The candy didn't even small like strawberries, just tasted like gummi sugar. Somehow this batch got missed when they added flavoring. I will try them again. Vendor shipped fast and they were very fresh."
positive,1/6/21,"The peppercorns arrived in a nice resealable bag and are of good quality. It's difficult to compare them to other peppercorns but they do the job and they're organic so that's all good in my book."
positive,20/8/21,Great taste and great quality. Smells wonderful. I saved my store bought container and re-used it for these. Grinds so easy in my pepper grinder!
positive,14/8/21,I bought these to make homemade peanut butter.  It turned out wonderfully.  My 15 month old daughter loves it on her waffles.
positive,21/4/21,"I have purchased the Zoe evoo in cans (regular and organic) many times in the past and been very satisfied.  I like this Zoe 100% arbequina evoo even better, as far as taste goes.  It is very flavorful, somewhat grassy with no bitter taste, and has a smooth, silky texture.  It is more of a rich yellow color than green.  It is a great all purpose oil that holds up to sauteeing, drizzling over cooked pasta, for use in salad dressings and for bread dipping.  It is also pretty economical to use for all kitchen uses, especially when purchased on subscription basis. This comes in a clear bottle, not my preference for storage of olive oils, so I have wrapped the bottles with foil to minimize light exposure and slow degradation.  Oils can also be stored in the refrigerator or freezer to maintain quality."
positive,1/4/21,I have used 3 of the 6 bags so far and have been pleasantly surprised at how few bad beans are in each bag.<br /><br />Excellent quality.
positive,17/4/21,These bean are wonderful. They are very moist and smell amazing!I started making a batch of homemade vanilla extract and the color is already a dark amber; only after a few days! Will definetly buy again!!!!
positive,10/3/21,Used for Vanilla Extract for Christmas gifts.  Excellent quality especially for the price. Definitely would order again and recommend others to order.
positive,22/4/21,"I was very impressed with the quality of the vanilla beans I received. Not only were they at least 60% less expensive than the beans in grocery/specialty stores, but the beans were plump and very flavorful. I also received my order very quickly (sooner than the seller stated). I will definitely be back to buy my next batch of vanilla beans here."
positive,25/4/21,"This is excellent quality caster sugar, very fine.  Great price.  Is a must have for making shortbread cookies."
positive,1/4/21,I made rum soaked worms for a TGIF for my building and they were a big hit. Really good texture and taste just plain too
negative,30/6/21,This item shipped quickly and looked nice but it fell apart after about two weeks.  Look elsewhere for a komboloi.
positive,1/3/21,"Definitely the way to go when you buy the base unit.  Grasses last a long time if you give good light and sufficient water.  I wouldn't buy this without the base to save money though, because the wooden base keeps the grass tray from moving and tipping over when kitties munch on it. Good quality, great value!"
positive,29/1/21,"I regularly order this soy milk product and use it with granola cereal. It is great by itself as well. Be sure to serve chilled. It has a strong vanilla flavor, which I like. I keep thinking that I'm going to get tired of it, but it still tastes great each and every carton."
negative,17/4/21,A friend got the Everlasting Treat ball and 2 extra refills for my 17lb. dog.  My dog is not a destructive chewer but he had chunks of the blue part torn out within 20 min. It makes me mad when I think of how much it and the replacement treats cost and now it is trash.  That is why I am writing this review.
positive,10/3/21,"Fromm is outstanding quality food.  You know how when starting a dog on a new type of food you need to wean them into the new food by giving a little bit at first and then more and more?  Fromm is such great quality that it doesn't have a ""transition time"". I have a dog with a very sensitive stomach, and I can tell the quality of a food by whether he will get GI issues after first eating it.  He can eat Fromm with no problems at all."
positive,30/5/21,"I bought these noodles at an overstock store once, and had I known at the time how good they were going to be I would have stocked up. As it stands, unless you live near an asian market or similar store you'll have a difficult time getting these locally. Fortunately, Amazon provides. All of the varieties are very good, this one brings out the savory flavor of the mushrooms and the texture of the bean thread noodles is satisfying. It prepares quick and easy, and only requires boiling water like a typical self contained ramen bowl. Great for work, and quite filling for the size and price."
positive,28/9/21,"This condiment ROCKS! Tasty, spicy and hot.  Loving it.  Just ordered the 4-pack.  Has won a long time customer.  I put this chili oil on Raman noodles with pork and green onion, a little ginger and a little hoisin and fish sauce and you got yourself a delicious meal. 5 STAR for sure!!!"
positive,6/5/21,"I bought this for my fiance for Valentine's day, and he actually got me the same thing at the store. The ones I ordered taste so much better! Super fresh! Absolutely addicting."
positive,20/4/21,I used these tablets during a demonstration for a talk I gave about taste to a group of student chefs.  Needless to say they were amazed and pleased with the effects.  The tablets were easy to distribute and very effective in turning lemons into candy!  thanks!
positive,20/4/21,"When I first adopted my dog, I did a vast amount of research to find out what was truly best to feed him. He's a chihuahua mix, and as I was reading such mixed reviews about whether small dogs would benefit from a high protein diet or not I decided I just had to try it for myself. He did have a little trouble with digestion while I was transitioning him to the food, he was eating Royal Canin prior. He's been eating it for about seven months now and he's doing phenomenal. He has great muscle tone and energy. His coat is silky and shinny when it had been coarse and dull. Yes, it's on the pricey side but if you closely watch what you put in your body as humans why wouldn't you want your best friend to benefit from great food."
positive,21/4/21,I was anxious to try making my own ijera at home after living in Ethiopia for 15 months and have had fairly good success with this tef flour.  It is the dark variety but I enjoy the great almost mocha flavor.  I can tell it is fresh because it develops a good sour starter on its own without needing to add any additional sourdough starter  or yeast.
negative,2/5/21,"[[ASIN:I purchase these probably 1 year ago.  I was very disappointed with the quality.  I was unable to eat these sardines.  They had scales and hard bones along with a tough texture.  Sorry product.  I'm giving them to the cats.<br /><br />B000EEWZF0 Crown Prince Natural Skinless & Boneless Sardines in Pure Olive Oil, 3.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)]]"
negative,25/5/21,"I purchased this item because I wanted the tea chest.  The item description is completely inaccurate.  It states that it is a ""Wood Grain"" tea chest.  The chest is a cheap box that is very poorly covered with a wood grain contact paper.  I say poorly because the faux wood contact paper has ripples and bubbles all over it.  Please don't waste your money or time on this item like I did."
positive,7/9/21,I am really happy with this product and will definitely buy more products from Andean Treasures in the future. This is a good high quality product that tastes amazing in shakes. Incredibly fast shipping as well. I ordered late Friday evening and received it early mon morning.
positive,25/5/21,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT! BOB'S RED MILL BRAND IS THE BEST!  I'VE BOUGHT FLAXSEED FROM OTHER SUPPLIERS AND HAVE BOUGHT THEM FROM WELL KNOWN HEALTH FOOD STORES ONLY TO BITE INTO WHAT SEEMS LIKE PIECES OF DIRT GATHERED ALONG WITH THE SEED. ? I NEVER HAVE THAT PROBLEM WHEN I PURCHASE THIS BRAND.  GOOD VALUE FOR THE MONEY."
positive,22/5/21,"The quality of the almonds is so much better than my local supermarkets. I just started eating raw almonds, and I didn't think I would be able to tell the difference between suppliers. Besides the great quality, the pricing is good, too."
positive,19/7/21,I find these are excellent quality almonds at a resonable price. They are really going fast---going to have to order more soon.
negative,7/9/21,"I ordered two boxes and the K-Cups are less than half filled with coffee, Sounds more like little maracas. Also leaves grounds at the bottom of cup. Apparently there is not a return policy for these K-Cups. Very bummed out."
negative,25/8/21,"This item comes in a pkg of 3 bags.  The first one was like dust.  It even smelled like dust when I ground the beans, no coffee scent at all.  I just opened the 2nd bag and it does smell like coffee, and much better taste too, but it's so not worth having to throw away an entire bag.  That makes the cost per pound way more than this coffee is worth."
positive,6/9/21,I purchased these ears because of the excellent price. And was shocked to see the quality.<br />each ear was individually wrapped like one of the reviews mentioned. Also fresh.  I love the fact<br />that they are individually wrapped you can take them with you.  The dachshunds and lab Luv them......<br />I definitely would purchase this brand again..
negative,25/5/21,"My dog hates this food, and through some research I have found that Science Diet is not very good quality. I have instead switched over to Orijen, a little more expensive but worth it for a healthier and happier dog."
positive,7/9/21,"I love the honey I bought.I bought 8 bottles of it. Hope next time, I can let them deliver them as soon as possible."
positive,13/10/21,"These dates are as close as you can get without picking them off the tree yourself. They are also much cheaper than the nearly $8/lb. at local stores that aren't even organic. Great deal for a great product."
positive,2/10/21,"I have used almost every India Tree item, and have had wonderful results with their products.<br /><br />Taste and quality in conjunction with excellent Amazon service and delivery makes the decision to purchase a no brainer."
negative,23/9/21,"A majority of the PODS are defective. They either don't have enough air pressure in the POD (which results in non-consistent coffee taste) or they are poorly sealed which results in coffee spilling out the side of the POD into your Keurig. Either way I will never order this brand again."
positive,26/6/21,I am a huge fan of Navitas brand products.  The quality of the Cacao is top notch and will be the brand I get from here on out.  Love it
positive,25/5/21,"I bought these for a bridal shower for gift bags.  I received the item quickly and the chocolate was perfectly wrapped.  Another review noted that some of the wrappers were broken.  I only had maybe 1 where I had to fix the wrapper.  I thought they looked great.  I am giving it 4 stars only because I do feel as though it's overpriced for what you get."
positive,7/9/21,"Love this bag! Perfect size. I've been using it to make a 1/2 gallon of fresh almond milk every 2-3 days for the last 6 weeks and it works great. Super-fine mesh makes a super-smooth milk, and it rinses clean in a snap. The seams are very well sewn (unlike others I've seen, where the thread is already unraveling) so I expect it will hold up for a good long time. I bought 2 more to give to my mother and my sister."
positive,15/7/21,"I use a lot of seeds for making breads, salad dressings, and in other cooking.  These are excellent sesame seeds.  The only drawback is that it takes a while to use up two packages and unless you are careful to keep the seeds cool and out of the sun they lose a little quality after a few months.  Toast them to bring out the flavor.  Grind them up when making salad dressings and add them to your other ingredients to add new flavor to your dressings.  I toss a handful into salads, onto cooked vegetable or add them to marinades for poultry and meats.  Sesame is very versatile and healthy eating!"
positive,3/6/21,"If you need small amount, this bottle is enough for 4 to 5 pinches. Good quality. It sealed with a cork and clear plastic wrap on top. I generally use it for arroz caldo and some spanish dishes like paella.<br /><br />Product of Spain. 0.70 gm per bottle.  Around six bucks a bottle at the store."
positive,27/9/21,These glazed walnuts are always fresh and Amazon has the best price on them.  I use them in a salad I make and they are always a hit.<br /><br />Joe
positive,19/6/21,"This bone is VERY BIG. So for the price it is definitely a good deal. It will last over a year for my 2 big dogs (1 a Labrador, the other a golden retriever) even if they chew it every day."
positive,25/5/21,quality gum ball machine. I am very happy with it. solid glass and classic look. It is a christmas gift for my daughter and a great way to show her how to save money. plus she gets a little reward.
negative,7/9/21,"I received this product and eagerly offered the dog the first biscuit out of the box.  She stepped back and walked away without hesitating.  I smelled the biscuit and it had a rancid peanut butter smell to it.  I checked the other 9 in the box and they all smelled the same...bad.  What a shame since we had purchased these previously and the dog enjoyed them.  I won't be purchasing anymore online and will stay with the local pet store for fresh treats."
positive,3/8/21,The tiny bubbles and flavor choice makes this an above average non-alcholic beverage.  Others tend to be more like soda pop.
positive,5/9/21,"Its great to use as a base for homemade deodorant body powder. FYI, talc is poisonous and is the main ingredient in most body powders."
positive,25/5/21,"Thanks for the speedy shipping, got the products right on time. Very high quality Maple syrup, I will definitely buy Coombs brand Maple syrup from Amazon again."
negative,7/9/21,"I didn't like the Bob's Red Mill golden flax seed because it had too many pieces of stems and dark, discolored flax seeds in it.  I thought the price, compared to some other sellers, was too high.  I will not purchase this product again."
negative,11/9/21,"I drink tea everyday and was excited to find such a great deal on this tea.  Regrettably, the only good part about this tea was the price.  The tea tastes somewhat bitter and earthy and not in a good way and is weak also.  I will not buy this again and will stick to PG Tips or Yorkshire Gold."
positive,13/7/21,I use it frequently and it is hard to find locally. It is great for baked goods.  I would this purchase again.
positive,22/7/21,"For those into nutritional suppliments, this is a good quality product at a fair price from our mid-western region."
positive,22/6/21,"Quality fruit, great texture not a brick! on the top of my reorder list! Highly recommend to all who love a lite fruit cake"
positive,28/7/21,"The candy was fresh and well-packaged.  I divided into smaller ziploc bags to keep it from going stale (I have no idea how long it would take to go stale, but I wasn't taking any chances) and we ate it over the following months with no complaints.<br /><br />I just placed an order for another 5 lb bag."
positive,13/10/21,"I've used Fenugreek in the past to increase milk production when I was breast feeding. While I'm currently not breastfeeding, I decided to start taking it again. The reason - it makes your body odors smell like maple syrup! As weird as this may seem, I just wanted to be able to sweat and not smell like onions, and this did the job after taking it for one day. No side effects, other than it does seem to make your bust fuller, not drastically, hardly noticeable, but I can tell a slight difference. I gave it 5 stars since this particular brand seems to be pretty potent compared to what I used to take. I noticed the maple syrup smell after a few days with the old stuff, this worked after one day, and doesn't have a weird smell to it, making it easy for me to swallow."
positive,19/2/21,"I don't normally use honey but I drink a fair amount of tea and wanted something healthier than white sugar or products like Splenda, etc.<br /><br />Just got two one pound jars of Really Raw Honey and I must say it's much nicer than what I'm used to at the local grocery store.<br /><br />It's packed in glass jars which is the proper way to pack honey (it can absorb things from plastics). Plus its totally unfiltered yet seems more sophisticated in both taste and texture than the super market stuff.<br /><br />It's a solid, so it's less messy than the liquid variety. I just made a cup of tea and dipped a spoon into the honey and it scoops easily up and melted into my tea right away,<br /><br />If you think honey is too cumbersome to use, reconsider. I can't honestly say this brand is better than others in its class but it is definitely nicer than the typical filtered, liquid, plastic squeeze container variety found in most super market brands.<br /><br />Addendum: April 2009 - my latest jars have been 2Lbs 10oz sizes. These have been packed in plastic, not glass jars unlike my 1lb jars were. If this is of concern to you, contact mfgr. to ask about glass jar options.<br /><br />EDIT: Feb 2010 - I should add that I buy direct from Really Raw. Their price includes shipping within the continental US - FYI"
positive,14/12/20,"I wanted to learn how to use gluten in making wheat bread, and chose this brand because of the positive reviews I read on Amazon.  The quality is good and seems to work well.<br /><br />I would have loved it if this product came with some recipes and tips."
positive,14/12/20,"Packaged well. Healthy on arrival and have held up a month later. KL Design provided great support. Shipped quickly. Great communication and when they realized a mistake was made for the cost of shipping, KL corrected the issue before I even realized there was a mistake. I would definitely buy from them again."
positive,19/2/21,These were as I remember them. Totally yummy.  They came quickly. They were well packaged with mylar bubble wrap and a small ice pack to keep them fresh.. Ordering anything from this shop is safe and worry free. Thank you.
positive,10/1/21,"Had a box of their garlic sticks, and really enjoyed the quality and satisfying feeling from eating them.<br />Wanted to try a new flavor, and the sesame is quite addicting!! Only 2 Weight Watchers points for 4 incredible sticks. These are made in Italy.<br />Expect many of the breadsticks to be broken, but don't let this stop you from trying this premium brand!"
negative,26/3/21,"These are not the York Peppermint Patties that I am accustomed to. They are very noticeably made of lower quality ingredients. After I took a single bite I could tell something was wrong, so I checked the packaging and sure enough these are manufactured in Mexico (I saw on another variety here on Amazon that people were complaining about the quality of the 'Made in Mexico' York Peppermint Patties). This product is a waste of money."
positive,24/3/21,"THIS IS A GREAT BARGAIN.  THE BEANS ARE ALL TERRIFIC AND LOOK VERY FRESH AND CLEAN.  I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT FIVE STARS IF ONLY IT WERE EASIER TO STORE LOL.  ITS KIND OF A BULKY HEAVY BAG, BUT HEY, ITS STILL GREAT AND I HAVE NOT HAD A SINGLE BATCH FAIL ME.  I WILL ORDER THIS ITEM AGAIN FOR SURE."
positive,24/2/21,Love this product. Highly recommended. This is now our 5th bottle. This is concentrate so it lasts a while. We mix with water or ice tea.
positive,19/2/21,"Very happy with these beans - they're very fresh, very fragrant, and arrived quickly.<br /><br />I used the whole package to make a gigantic batch of vanilla extract to give as Christmas gifts:  I split all the beans lengthwise, and added them to a 750 mL bottle of vodka, shaking about once per week for several months.  To package, I strain the extract through a goldtone coffee filter into a gift-sized bottle, and add a section of vanilla bean to the bottle.  The flavor is excellent, and much cheaper than buying vanilla extract at the store.<br /><br />Also, I put any leftover pieces of vanilla bean into my sugar canister (leave them out to dry first!) for yummy vanilla sugar.<br /><br />Highly recommended."
negative,14/12/20,"This is the second time I have ordered this product. The first time I thought it was very good. This time,however, it tastes as though it has been watered down. The consistency is thinner and the taste is weaker. I will not purchase this again."
negative,19/10/21,"I carefully read all the reviews on this Item before ordering! I must say, there are not that many real Tea drinkers writing reviews for this particular Item. Sure, if you are a Lipton dipper, this is a great tea. But if you know what a quality tea should offer, you would not have given this product more than 2-Stars.<br />The Aroma when first open the bag, is quiet decent, but when the tea is Brewed, the flavor is a disaster. It is basically a lipton like flavor. The color, is also unlike a good quality Earl-gray! Which it should have an amber color, that can be anywhere from light, to deep end of the spectrum, depending if the tea is a Single Body, or need to be mixed with another tea for potentiation of Color.<br /><br />At last, the tea leaves are not uniformly sized, which basically means this tea is probably a mixture of low quality teas, just flavored as Earl-Gray!<br /><br />Coffee Bean direct should consider offering a better tea, for a few more $$$!!! At least 2Lb of tea would be worth Brewing!"
positive,18/5/21,"Comes vacuum packed in a foil package (inside wooden box).  Flavor is excellent and really couldn't be better."
positive,19/2/21,"Fine quality, but expensive.  You can find the same amount for 1/3 price at places like Trader Joe's."
negative,14/12/20,"I didn't purchase this from Amazon although I was about to since the 12 pack is so much cheaper than buying individual bags at the grocery store. So I thought I'd try a couple of bags to see how I liked them. The first bag was wonderful - plump, sweet, juicy pieces of ginger. Nicely sweetened with a good, hot ginger hit. The second bag was awful - mushy ginger and some pieces with strange unnatural textures. And the ginger was way too hot in that second bag.<br /><br />Not sure what's going on. But I also tried a couple of bags of the Reed's and liked their ginger much, much better. And the quality was consistent."
positive,1/6/21,"I have enjoyed many PR's up to 30-40 dollars a pound and have a very good sense of quality. This is about an 18 month as stated. It is on the mild side which is quite special in itself. It has a fresh wonderful buttery taste of a fresh PR. There is individual merit for the various ages up to 36 months. I personally do not like the 36 months variety.<br /><br />This is a bargain and to be well appreciated.<br /><br />Pay the next day during the hot months.<br /><br />Mt second order 2 weeks later was not fresh, dried out not the young freshness and tenderness of a 18 month - did not taste good. Why!?<br /><br />We really like these cheese. The third shipment was perfect."
positive,1/4/21,"Hi,<br /><br />Bought these for my parents and I am glad that I made right choice. Parents as well as myself I eat them regularly. I eat my whey protein powder in milk before I mix these cereals. My father has diabetes but he has no complaints."
positive,15/4/21,"I ordered these to make sachets for baby shower favors. I added my own sage and lavender colored ribbon after filing them with lavender (from the same supplier). They look like I spent a fortune on them but I didn't! I have left-overs which I plan on using for gifts, tea bags, and also to make oil infusions with. I'm quite pleased with them!"
positive,19/5/21,"these are excellent quality bags (heavy, tight weave)--minimal, if any, floaties. (i use them, primarily, for tea.) ...if you decide to purchase them, you won't be disappointed."
positive,19/2/21,"I've purchased cheaper bags since buying these which work well.  These are thicker and cheaper here than at a pet store."
positive,14/12/20,I shared this with my daughter and her family.  We enjoy the smooth mellow taste. Good hot or cold.  We enjoy high quality speciality loose teas and this is equal to Tevanas.
positive,28/7/21,"I love this canola oil. Organic canola is hard to find and this is pricey, but it's worth it to me. I'll be ordering again, soon."
positive,29/6/21,"These rice cakes (and this brand) are the best in every regard---they're friendly to the environment; they're great for those of us who are allergic to wheat; they have a wonderful, substantive texture, and taste really good.  I'll be a repeat customer for a long time."
positive,15/10/21,This is one of the very few flavors my cat will eat. She digests it well and seems to enjoy it.
positive,20/7/21,"This purchased was well package, arrived undamaged and in a timely manner. The product was the best solid white albacore tuna I have ever had. It was much better than the name brands in my local markets. I have already placed a second order. I highly recommend this product."
positive,12/10/21,"I ordered several products from Superior Nut Company including these Milk Chocolate Covered gummy bears. I was skeptical ordering something like chocolate over the mail but they arrived unscathed and very fresh. I do alot of baking and I will definitely be buying from this seller again. Fair prices, excellent product."
positive,19/2/21,"I compared so many different dog food brands before I settled on Blue Buffalo.  I used to feed my swiss mountain dogs Holistic anchovy until they changed the recipe to include pork and chicken meal (presumably to save $$).  Blue buffalo has none of that in it and it gets delivered to my front door in two days with Amazon prime.  Call me a nut but I always taste the food I feed my dogs so I can get a real idea of what I am feeding them, because lets be honest most of our dogs would eat anything that you put in front of them.  Lets just say that Blue Buffalo had a lot more of an authentic fish and oatmeal taste and texture than Holistic or Eagle Pack did.  I also add a little pro-biotic to their food to help with digestion.  I will be buying Blue Buffalo in the future for my boys."
positive,14/12/20,"We sent this basket to my mother in law for Mother's Day and she loved it.  I was worried because she will definitely let us know if she doesn't like something and she really raved about this.  I didn't see the basket in person, but she said the items in it were all very nice.  She was most excited about a package of soap petals that was included.  She said they looked just like dried flowers, but you use one petal at a time as soap.  She'll be using those in her guest bathroom.  The food items were all really good quality and there was a really nice picture frame in the box too.  She also raved about the box itself and plans on using it on it's own.<br /><br />This is the 3rd Art of Appreciation gift basket I've sent as gifts and I always get good responses, so I'd feel confident about sending this as a gift."
positive,2/7/21,This white rice flour is fine instead of coarse like some.  Great for baked goods. My gluten free sugar cookies and shortbread cookies turn out excellent.
positive,11/3/21,"Fast delivery and excellent quality.  You can use the cinnamon in traditional recipes, on cereal, vebetables, etc.  It naturally has a somewhat sweet taste to it."
negative,10/4/21,"After being pleased with my first order of these rawhides, I set up a recurring order for them. We received a box last week and were disappointed to find that the quality of these bones is not the same as the first order. The first order of bones contained rawhides that were tightly-rolled and long-lasting, but these have inner layers that are brittle and easily broken. One of our dogs actually cut her mouth or gums on the brittle shards--we didn't realize it until we saw blood on the bone itself. Amazon is refunding the purchase price. I may try one more time with this brand. If anyone has found a consistent quality brand at this kind of price, please let us know. Maybe my budget is the problem..."
positive,22/7/19,Package was received at expected time. More importantly the walnuts are fresh- of good size- and excellent flavor. No preservatives such as BHT which some other companies use.
negative,2/2/20,"I have bought vanilla beans for several years for making homemade ice cream.  I always buy from Amazon because the supermarket vanilla beans are usually old and expensive.  I just received my order of these and was very disappointed.  The beans were stiff, not pliable as a good vanilla bean should be.  They did not have an oily feel to them, which is another sign of quality and freshness.  Also, there were less of the seeds that you get from the inside of the bean, which is where most of the flavor comes from, compared to previous purchases I have made. Finally, they did not have a very strong vanilla aroma - no where near as strong as other vanilla beans that I have bought in the past.<br /><br />I just used beans from the last order I bought (well over a year ago) along with these vanilla beans that I just ordered.  The old ones were MUCH better in quality than these new ones despite being quite a bit older.  I always vacuum seal the beans after I use them to help keep their freshness, but the other vanilla beans are still well over a year older than these new ones and were far better in quality."
positive,2/2/20,"i only write reviews when i get crappy product, crappy service, or excellent product and service.  these beans were moist and plump.  the smell is heavenly.  in fact, i placed the envelope they were mailed in into my lingerie drawer because throwing it away seemed to be a huge waste of fragrance.  i have placed the beans in vodka and bourbon, and altough it will be some time before i have vanilla extract, i am excited about the end result.  i couldn't believe how quickly the beans arrived---i've bought books that were shipped from a few states over that took 3 times as long to get here, and cost more to ship.  i will definitely order from this company again, and again, and again."
positive,31/8/19,"I recently discovered freeze dried foods and these garlic bits are very nice. Yes, expensive but I mainly use them when I bake bread. These do taste like garlic and re-hydrate very well. Target carries a line of freeze dried herbs (cost a little cheaper and get little more) and I will compare those to these."
positive,22/7/19,i loved these peanuts they were just so good all of them and they came just as advertised.
positive,12/1/20,"I am a tuna snob!  This tuna is close in quality to the best tuna I have had and works well for making large qauntities when the best tuna is cost prohibitive.  I mix with cannelini beans, olive oil (generous amount) and chopped red onions for a great meal with greens or bread or both!"
positive,19/2/20,"Good quality product.  I was having difficulty finding Hungarian Paprika in the local markets.  Amazon offered a wide variety of this product.  The multi-container offer was set at a good price.  I'm quite satisfied.  I would order it again."
positive,27/11/19,"I haved use this and wow I never knew how good olive oil could taste. I was so used to Bertolli, I will never go back as long as I can find Zoe at such a good price."
positive,12/12/19,"This gift package surprised me when it arrived.  The little cutting board was the perfect size for its intended use.  The food products were of very good quality and just the perfect portions for a great snack time. I was very happy to give this as a gift to a relative who has everything, but enjoys good food.  It arrived in quickly and in perfect condition."
positive,26/9/20,"I use lots of bay leaves when cooking and find many brands lack the bright pungency that adds a special touch to a dish.  These have a nice bright green color. They flavor dishes quite nicely.  I was surprised to find that these were as good as those of Spice Islands, which I have tended to prefer over all other brands."
positive,22/7/19,"This is one of the best traditional pasta sauces around. Usually I would mix some oregano, some basil and some garlic powder to give my gravy some taste but this doesn't need any additional items. It's great just out of the jar!"
negative,2/2/20,"The fruit arrived in a timely fashion, but much of the fruit was not ripe, and quality was very poor.  Most of the fruit delivered was fruit easily obtainable at most grovery stores for a fraction of what was charged for this basket.  Don't waste your money!"
positive,23/5/20,"I really satisfied with this product. It does what it supposed to do in very effective way. If your baby has digestion problems, it's the natural and healthy way to solve it."
positive,22/11/20,"This is very good quality foil.  I can't find a difference between this recycled and 100% virgin."
positive,30/3/20,"Just ordered my 2nd bag from this company. Wish the bag wasn't so flimsy - I had to double bag it after opening- but other than that, excellent quality seeds and very prompt delivery."
positive,8/7/20,I bought this seed to make centerpieces for a safari-themed baby shower. I did a test run with one planter last week. They sprouted beautifully - and close to 100% germination. The grass is tall and healthy (within only 8 days).
positive,4/1/20,I ordered this as pumpkin seems to be in very short supply this year.  I was unable to find it at any of my three local grocery stores.  The quality of this is excellent.
negative,30/1/21,"Our 15 pound dachshund absolutely loved this toy but in less than a week he had the face chewed off, the eyes chewed off, the tips of the ears chewed off and a hole in the tail, plus had removed both squeekers. I don't recommend this at all. I'm just going to keep buying the $2 toys that last the same amount of time."
positive,2/11/20,They germinated! Seeds in an overall good condition. I got around 15 seedlings in about 4 weeks. I recommend this product
positive,17/10/20,"I bought these for my brother in another state and accidentally had them shipped to me.  I am so glad that I did because then I had the opportunity to try them.  By the time I reordered some for him, they were out of stock.  They are in stock now, but will arrive after Christmas.  Great taste, quality. I have not found one bad one yet!"
negative,22/7/19,"I was looking forward to trying this bold coffee flavor which was supposed to have a sweet flavor.  However, although package arrived earlier than promised, the beans were old (dull, not glossy) without evidence of oil on them (which fresher beans would have).  Lacked powerful smell (if fresh, would have been strong when opened).  Consequently, this coffee tasted poor/watery after beans were ground and dripped."
positive,2/2/20,"THE TASSIMO MACHINE WITH IT'S DISC TECHNOLOGY, IS AN AMAZING PRODUCT.THE CONVENIENCE OF BEING ABLE TO SELECT SO MANY DIFFERENT HOT BEVERAGES IN ONE MACHINE IS BENEFICIAL TO OUR BUSINESS. OUR COMPANY USES THE TASSIMO IN OUR SHOWROOM, SO CUSTOMERS MAY ENJOY THE BEST QUALITY BEVERAGE, WHILE BROWSING OUR DISPLAYS. THUMBS UP!"
positive,4/10/20,"This is a really good deal on some high quality chia seeds. There really isn't much more to say, if you use chia seeds these are a great buy."
negative,1/4/20,"I bought this as a gift for my husband and it was disappointing.  The quality of the chocolate is very poor, closer to Hershey kisses than Dove or Godiva.  The bacon flavor was off, kind of bitter and more like bacon bits than actual bacon.  Overall, i wish i hadn't wasted $30 on 4 bars of sub-par chocolate. I know you want to try this for yourself because you think that everyone is being too picky, that's what i thought too, but don't!  Save your money and make your own chocolate bacon bar at home."
positive,8/5/20,"This is a great buy and the quality is great. We add this to our coffee every day and have been very pleased with this. Yipee, you don't have to pay supermarket prices."
positive,18/6/20,"I like these.  They are short enough to be cute, but stretch enough to cover everything vital. They are very comfortable and stretchy, not too tight.  They wash up nice without pilling and I have had no problem with the gold rear design peeling or coming off."
positive,20/8/20,"This dried pineapple is of very good quality. The pineapple pieces are of a good size and moist.<br />My 6 year old daughter loves them,and requests them for her school snack pack."
negative,1/6/21,"Sold by Amazon, the package arrived leaked with caps unsealed and easily opened. When used, the liquid ran out much faster than normal. Can't believe Amazon sold used products. Very unhappy!!!!!!!!"
positive,4/7/21,The beans came well packaged and in time. We have never had a problem with these beans. They have always been good in quality.
positive,5/2/20,I have been buying pig ears for my brother dogs for over ten years. These were the best quality that I ever purchase. They were bigger and the quality is just as good then what I purchase from other online stores.
positive,22/7/19,"Trophy Nut - These are Excellent quality, fresh cashews. Roasted, dry not oily.<br />Snack size packs are convenient for take-along."
positive,2/2/20,"These Tahitian vanilla beans were just what I was looking for! I was very glad that they were more or less the same size/thickness. However, there were a couple in one of my orders and one bean in another that had some mould growing on them, so I had to toss some. That was the only downside. They even arrived a little early, too."
positive,22/11/20,"My husband and I really enjoy this product.  We purchase it from a German Baptist bulk foods store in town and have tried the Black Currant and the Blueberry.  I was rather skeptical when my husband brought the bottle over to me to see what I thought but figured we'd try it for the price.  We're not sorry as it is very quality flavor, easy to mix and great for the price as you dilute it 1 party syrup to 7 parts water.  (I actually use more water because we don't want it very sweet.)<br />I would highly recommend this product!"
positive,1/3/20,"Espresso pods are a no-fuss, no-muss way to go. I use the MyPressi espresso maker, which I love, and pods make clean-up a snap. The Lucaffe mixed case includes two SKUs. I kind of wish there's been more, but both are so tasty I can't complain. They also arrived loose in a box, which was surprising for me, but not a particular problem. Five stars because both my ""complaints"" are trivial and are irrelevant to the quality of the product."
positive,23/11/20,This is a high quality tea.  You can instantly tell the difference between this Earl Grey and the other more commons ones you find in the grocery store.  They are of such quality you can steep twice for two cups instead of one.
positive,5/4/21,"Very good product, the $4.00 increase did less to change my subscription. I love this product and will continue buying in future."
positive,27/4/20,"This was the second time I've ordered the 5lbs bag from Amazon. Both times I've gotten the freshest Good & Plenty's I've ever gotten. I get them at the store or at the movies and they are tough even hard. I loved them and thought that's just how they came until I had them soft and chewy. Awesome!"
positive,8/3/21,"Good looking, good hand feeling, stable with cold and hot water shift;<br />I got them within 48 hours after I placed the order."
negative,30/1/20,Soft and Stale.  We ate a few when we opened the jug but we will throw the rest away.
negative,22/7/19,"Noamally get a different brand at Costco, which is far superior to Keenan Farms.  Priced copetitively, but not good quaity, would not order again."
positive,2/2/20,"I have found this product to be a good quality, organic tea that you can drink everyday without breaking the bank.  I like to vary the types of tea I drink throughout the day, so this one is just fine by my standards and enjoyable to drink."
negative,2/9/20,"I placed my first order for this product in March of 2011, and I was very pleased with what I received (I had never tried coconut milk before).  The coconut milk was thick and creamy.  If I didn't shake the can before opening it, there was a layer of (very tasty) cream at the top.<br /><br />I finished my first case at the end of May and decided to sign up for Amazon's subscription plan for Roland Coconut Milk.  The new case arrived very quickly, but the content of the cans was not the same.  This time, the coconut milk was watery and had a flavor I was not fond of.  There was no layer of cream at the top of the can, and it just sounded differently when I shook the can (being of much thinner consistency).<br /><br />Both products were Roland Organic Coconut Milk.  I did notice some slight differences on the cans.  The thicker, tasty, non-subscription cans were ""AUSTRALIAN CERTIFIED ORGANIC,"" had a 2004 copyright, and were a product of Thailand.  The watery cans that came with the subscription had a ""KLBD"" symbol on them, were certified by Control Union Certifications, had a 2010 copyright, and were a product of Sri Lanka.  Both cans listed the same ingredients and nutrition information.<br /><br />I should also note that I had no problem with the packaging of my first, non-subscription order.  There were very minor dents on about 1/4 of the cans, but nothing that made me consider throwing them away.  The packaging of the subscription order was a mess.  It was completely falling apart and a can fell out of the box when I picked it up.  I haven't actually opened the box, I've just slid the 2 cans I've opened out of the holes in it.  The one can that fell out was dented, but I think this was a result of the fall.  The other can was in good condition.<br /><br />If I had reviewed this product after receiving my first order, I would have given it five stars.  The lack of consistency in the product quality and the poor flavor of the 2nd order lead me to give this product a 1 star review."
positive,26/1/21,"I've been drinking lots and lots of tea over the past few months as I work through a low carb diet regime.  I had been buying varieties at the grocery store and decided it would be economical to simply buy a large sampler.  With that in mind I randomly chose Bentley's Finest Tea Classic Collection.  I couldn't have been more pleased with the quality of the tea.  The peach tea is in fact my favorite in the collection but the English Breakfast Tea made me a fan of that flavor where I never had been before.  I'll be watching for other tea collections from Bentley's."
positive,9/1/21,"We travel to VA frequently. I used to buy these there as favors for neighbors and then have the hassle of getting them back home. Now I just order from Amazon to arrive on the day we get home - the price is much less and no shipping hassles. The quality is excellent, I've tried the Costco version and they are just not as good and nowhere near as good as Planters or others."
negative,30/7/21,"I bought keenan Farms Pistachios once earlier. That batch appeared to alright.This time around the product is not upto mark at all. I have bought Pistachios from local stores also, which are far better and cheaper than this.<br />I have opened only one bag from the 3 that I have received. If any one from Keenam farms is reading this I can return these to them so that they can see what is in the bags sent to me."
positive,30/10/20,"These are quality hot stuffed peppers. They are filled with tuna and anchovies and not bread crump fillers like almost all the other stuffed products. The quality pepper as well as stuffing makes the product stand out, and also explains the extra cost. A healthy product with unsaturated vegetable fat.<br />Respectfully submitted."
negative,3/8/20,The quality of this item is very poor. My 17 pound dog played with it a total of 5 minutes before the seams fell apart. Would not recommend it.  I returned this item the next day.
positive,29/1/21,"I got the sampler pack, and was, in general, very happy with the coffees. I generally prefer my coffee on the intense side (no, not burnt, but with a lot of flavor), so I found the Corner Donut Shop to be too mild for my taste, but Cyclone was much more in line with my preferences.<br /><br />The coffee was all really fresh for a K-Cup. I found the ones marked Extra Bold to have the right amount of taste, while the regulars were passable.<br /><br />Now that I've sampled the variety, I'm ready to move on to the specific blends that match my palate."
positive,24/10/21,"Expensive but so far is the best green tea I could find. Coconut green is my favorite flavor, amazing. I will definitely order more."
positive,24/10/21,"The quality of these dates is fantastic, however they need to be chopped smaller and more uniformly. Most people probably used chopped dates for recipies, and I cannot imagine a recipe that would call for dates that are this coarsely chopped."
positive,16/10/21,"This is by far the best chili seasoning mix I've found in years. I especially like that there's no salt in the mix. The rich chili flavor it produces is unequaled by anything I've found elsewhere. It reminds me of the quality that was around when I was a child."
positive,24/10/21,"securely stores every precious ounce of breast milk. they are biodegradable, easy to use because they are large and stand up sturdily. i love these!"
positive,25/9/21,"These are wrapped neatly in bundles with ties around each bundle so you can select the amount you need after opening each package.  Using boiling water with a small amount of oil these cook up rapidly.  It is necessary to cool these down with cold water after they've been drained to avoid sticking like most other noodles.  The noodles themselves are very tasty and make an authentic lo mein.  I recommend these and will order more when these are gone.  That may not be for a while, though as these are packed in a case of 30 packages.  Just be sure you don't overcook them.  It only takes about 2 minutes to boil them soft."
positive,19/10/21,"The flavors in this product are absolutely fabulous. Naturally smoked lending a delicate, natural flavor of smoke. The only reason why I didn't rate a 5 star is that I find the little pellets do not dissolve well into cold dishes unlike the flaked style salts."
negative,20/10/21,"Hey, the description says 360 grams - that is roughly 13 ounces at under $4.00 per can. No way - that is the approximate price for a 100 gram can."
positive,19/10/21,"These little buggers are tough to find so I was happy to get a big pack at a good price online.  My daughter is content with these as a reward for doing something well and at 2 calories a piece, not all that unhealthy."
positive,15/6/21,These are a cheap alternative for summer when everyone wants a cold treat. Superior flavor and size than the Fla-Vor-Ice case.
negative,4/8/21,"This coffee supposedly is premium, it tastes watery--very thin.  Not good at all.  Maybe old??<br />Not sure, it was a waste, and I'm using it line the bottom of my sitting shoes and trash cans and rained-on luggage, to absorb the smells.  So I used it, but not to drink.  Do not buy."
negative,4/8/21,"Found this product for sale on vacation in North Carolina and loved it... great maple flavor!! Walmart sold it for 3.99$ for the 24oz pack. Wish i would have bought some more while I was there because i'm not paying 15$ for what Walmart can sell for 4$. That is just robbery... very disappointed in @#@zon for their insanely high price... If price was reasonable would love to buy more and rate much higher!!"
positive,18/7/21,This product was everything and more according to the advertisement.  I was totally satisfied with my purchase.  I recommend to everyone to purchase these chips from this site.
positive,18/10/21,"This is a delicious recipe and ingredients and the one I use. A bit pricy but if you don't mind the price point it makes a wonderful waffle. Combine this with a Waring Waffle maker and you could be in Waffle Heaven."
positive,15/6/21,"First time buyer of KA-ME Rice Crackers and I'm very impressed. These are very light, crisp and flavorful. They are as good plain as they are with cold cuts, fruit, etc. Unfortunately, the ones I purchased may be the last I get from this source. Right after I purchased the dozen packs, the price per dozen increased 44% to its present $37.99. Fortunately, I have enough to last a while, but assuming the price stays the same, these are my last KA-ME."
positive,4/8/21,"I got tired of overpaying for tea at Teavana so decided to try this brand of Oolong tea and was pleasantly surprised. It has a wonderful flavor and like the previous reviewer, I just put the bag in a tea ball to compensate for the poor quality of the bags. You just can't beat the value of this tea!"
positive,8/6/21,"DOP San Marzano canned tomatoes are the finest canned tomatoes on the planet... but I can get these for literally half the price at my local grocery store. Is this unusual? Boston is pretty heavily Italian in some areas... maybe that makes a difference. i don't understand why anyone would buy them at this price. Check your local grocery store before you buy them at this price."
positive,15/6/21,"I used these for my sons bday party as one of the sweet treats to have out.  they are great, the kids all loved them and the price was fabulous, way better than purchasing elsewhere.  the item came as described and was fresh.  Thank you amazon.com"
positive,4/8/21,"YES, these are wonderful and healthy cookies, but this is a rare bad deal from Amazon (really DAB Nutrition)- they are charging about $25 (including shipping).  In less than a minute of web searching I found the same quantity for about $15 shipped.  Enjoy the cookies, but buy from someone else until the price comes down."
positive,25/9/21,"If you love green tea then you will be impressed with this green tea powder. The instructions say to add one packet to 16 ounces of cold water but I'd recommend you try two packets and one packet (0.35 oz) of stevia. The flavor of the tea with only one packet is fairly mild, so mild in fact that you can barely taste the green tea flavor. When you order this tea you will get six boxes with 12 packets in each. If you use two packets per bottle of water you get 36 drinks. That is only .47 cents per drink if you get free shipping - I ordered some books too. I think that is fairly reasonable. I look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices. A website is given for additional recipes. There are a few interesting recipes like the ones for ""White Chocolate Green Tea Ice Cream,"" ""Green Tea Papaya Nectar"" and ""Green Tea Sugar Cookies."" You will probably find many uses for this and I've even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea. Just use one packet per 8 ounces of hot water. No brewing required. This tea dissolves very easily in hot or ice cold water. I can highly recommend it to you.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
negative,19/10/21,wE LOVED THIS POPCORN  BUT COME ON  SHIPPING IS WAY OVER THE TOP  WE WOULD SETTLE NEXT TIME FOR SOMETHING WE CAN BUY BUT NOT SPEND 3 TIMES ON SHIPPING
positive,4/9/21,"I've tried a handful of other brands of French Roast and I find this one and Tully's version to be both great and comparable in flavor. The difference is the price (this one is far more reasonable)."
positive,31/8/21,These are great spices to use on all food types giving a great flavor.  The bottle sizes are twice the size of that found in a supermarket and about the same price.  So you get more of what you would normally pay for.
positive,9/10/21,"Great option for excellent taste, price, and convenience. A repeat customer on these! We order these now in the 36 pack instead of getting at the grocery store."
positive,15/6/21,"I like to brew a k-cup cocoa into my coffee for a nice mocha.  This dark chocolate flavor is quite nice, especially mixed with Double Black Diamond coffee.  Though not the very best, it is good, and the price is right, compared to other brands."
positive,4/8/21,My kids have been begging for hot cocoa k-cups and when I found these so reasonably priced I decided to give them a try.  We all loved them.
positive,15/6/21,"We purchase this food for our two boxers and great dane. The dane has an allergy to chicken and one of the boxers has a weak stomach, so this food is perfect for them. All three dogs love it (even the picky one) and it seems to agree with their digestive tracts more than any other dog food that we've tried (I can't begin to tell you how pleased I am about THAT). I did a lot of research to find a quality food that isn't full of filler and won't break the bank. I am 100% pleased with this food, more so than any of the other more expensive brands that I've tried."
positive,4/8/21,"It's amazing how little popularity that Diamond Pet Foods seems to have considering the quality ingredients their foods contain!  I worked at a pet store for about four years. Our number one recommendations on foods were Natural Balance and Wellness- two EXCEPTIONAL foods that are pretty expensive.  But for those owners who have multiple dogs or even one large breed dog, those brands can cripple your budget.  So when I would get customers who absolutely LOVED their pets and wanted to be able to feed them healthy food without breaking their banks, I recommended Diamond.  Diamond dog food costs about the same as those commercial brands like Purina and Iams, but contains ONLY natural, healthy ingredients.  Just remember, the less garbage you feed your dog (by-products, fillers) the less your dog uses the bathroom- AND they stay fuller, longer!"
positive,15/6/21,Great for stocking up and keeping a few in the closet. I like to buy things in bulk and this was a good deal and smells good too.
positive,4/8/21,"These arrived fresh and in very good shape, Just like buying from the local store only cheaper and delivered to my door!"
positive,1/10/21,"3 years ago I bought a Digidesign 002 protools rack and a lot of other equipment to start recording - but I could never get it to work with my OS on either computer.  I was at an impasse for a long time until I saw this product on Blue's website.  I already had a $400 condenser mic in the closet I had never gotten to use and didn't want to spend more money on a quality USB mic.  I couldn't be happy that this product exists - in it's quality or price!  I noticed no noise or coloration of the signal and it worked without a problem.  It does exactly what it's suppose to do -- act like it doesn't exist.  It just serves it purpose to convert the signal well, and stays out of the way on everything else.  It does feel light weight and the signal was a little lower than i thought (as many reviews said) and that is the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars.  But I don't think that should keep anyone from getting this product."
positive,1/7/18,"I have a Keurig coffee maker. You know, the one with the K-Cups.  To have a coffee like this, you have to have a special filter, which I do have.  Honestly, you'll spend a crapload of money on K-cups if you don't get the filter for regular ground coffee.  Anyway, I don't know if it was because the coffee was ground or filtered a special way, but the water in my Keurig had a hard time seeping through, causing a bit of an overflow.  Aside from that, the taste was smooth and flavorful.  It has a coffee taste, plain and simple.  Is it anything special, not really.  It just tastes good and is reasonably priced."
positive,10/8/18,"I've used this BBQ sauce before and it is good especially considering that is free of so many negatives (like corn syrup and for us gluten) but the price on this can't be right.  Order directly from the Daddy Sam's website to pay $5.50/19 oz bottle.  This price would HAVE to be a case price although the description says 19oz."
positive,1/7/18,"4-year old Elkhound loves this food, and it keeps her in great health.  Amazon has the best price I've found for this food, and it's even better with subscribe and save.  I highly recommend it."
negative,10/8/18,"I absolutely love this stuff, but I pay $2.00 to $2.50 for a 6-pack in the grocery store.  Why is this price so HIGH?"
positive,13/9/18,"I'm no coffee snob but this is still much better than crap you get a Starbucks (I drink black coffee so flavor really matters when its not covered by caramel and other junk). Great coffee for a great price, especially if you get it when Amazon is offering the $3 off coupon."
positive,17/7/18,"not the best coffee but it is not bad as well. we bought more after we tried the first time because for the price we've got it is fine. Godiva is still our favorite but this one is okay too."
positive,16/1/19,"I was a little worried about the other reviews that said their wrappers were broken.  I wonder if they were pushing the wrappers they suggested (both suggested the same wrappers.... hmmm) However, the wrappers arrived intact.  In fact we took two packages camping and the left overs made it home without damage.  I detected no difference from the rice wrappers we buy locally at an Asian market.  Buying in bulk saved lots of $$.  There were a couple of wrappers - out of dozens -that had a few tiny air bubble holes in them.  It didn't affect the taste or function.  That is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  We weren't wrapping anything that was really drippy so it wasn't a problem.  We will definitely order again.  Shipping was rapid.  A great buying experience."
negative,16/1/18,"Go to Costco, and you can buy lower than this  price per oz. Currently $32 ($3 off regular $34.99)+ tax for big size = 0.83$/oz.<br /><br />Besides, it is more convinient to return if you kid does not like this formula<br /><br />Be careful, many times some sellers over price a product, and still make the product rank in the best sellers."
positive,16/1/19,"These are guaranteed to be a hit with my kids -<br />Like regular gummy bears, but even better - with extra flavor.<br />Perfect consistency....Not too chewy... great all the way around."
positive,1/8/20,"Excellent.  We have enjoyed Yuban coffee for many years.  We recently tried the Dark Roast Coffee and would recommend it if you want a rich tasting coffee.  Smooth; with no bitterness.  Beats the high price of many ""Gourmet Coffees"" without sacrificing that delicious flavor that coffee lovers look for."
positive,1/7/18,"There is nothing wrong with this product, but it is overpriced.  With a little research you can buy this for less than half the price.  Buyer beware"
positive,10/8/18,"Tried this because it is 100% Kona and much cheaper than the other national brands I have been using. What can i say i am greatly surprised. Mild, no bite too it and no discernable acidity. This is on my shopping list from now on."
positive,15/2/20,"My daughter loves these dinners. There's no other organic meat option at my grocery store, so we're stuck with this one, but I don't mind at all. I think they're great. I agree that they are runny, but you can just thicken it with whole grain cereal, and problem solved (turkey dinner is thick enough).  I also don't understand why people complain that they are too sweet, or unhealthy. First of all, if you don't like the ingredients, buy something else. Second, I trust Earth's Best enough to believe they know the right amount of stuff to put in their product. Third, the belief that if baby tastes sweet food, they will not eat regular food, is an old wife's tale. Are you people saying that you don't give your babies fruit and vegetables? They are all sweet.<br />The only reason I gave this particular item 4 stars instead of five, is the price. I can buy it at my grocery store for 79 cents a jar. Here, they are being sold for over 91 cents. And that's at the sale price. If you buy these at the regular price, it comes to $1.41. Way too much!"
positive,22/4/21,I purchased this food on Amazon then saw it at Babies R Us for 30 cents less per jar.  I like the product but AMAZON is overcharging!
positive,25/9/20,"With the Amazon Mom discount, this is cheaper than in stores unless there's a sale.  It regularly goes on sale at Kroger, Publix, and other grocery stores for around 50 cents a jar.  I wish there were other Earth's Best fruit varieties available on Amazon at this price.  No problems with breakage during shipping for me, but I found the packaging annoying.  In general though, I think Earth's Best is a good brand and that the price is fair for what you're getting:  organic, non-GMO baby food delivered to your door step!  As a single mom in a rural community, going to the grocery store with the baby can be such a hassle.<br /><br />Earth's Best is definitely better tasting and smelling than non-organic foods like Gerber.  The textures are good, but I had to stay on 1st foods longer than six months because the textures of almost all 2nd Foods made my son gag.  I had a similar issue graduating from 2nd Foods to 3rd Foods.  Sprout baby food, however, is the best quality I've tried for freshness, aroma, and taste.  It reminds me of pureed fresh produce.  While I've seen it in Winn-Dixie for the same price as Earth's Best, it's much more expensive on Amazon and the selection of flavors is relatively limited both in stores and online.  I'm going to start making my own organic baby food and freezing it, but I'll probably always keep a few jars of Earth's Best to get by in a pinch."
positive,16/11/19,"I was very pleased with the price of this product. And the shipping speed was fast! I like that I didn't have to lug this back from the grocery store. Thanks, Amazon!"
positive,9/9/20,"I bought this for my 1 year old and he loves it just as much as the other organic brands we've purchased, but I got this one for 30-50% less!  Great buy."
negative,1/7/18,"Beware of what you are being charged .... it says that it's $9.99 but 911Drugstore is charing you $39.99 plus $14 in shipping. (I've found this to be true for several other items on this site.)<br />I'm not sure if this is a misprint .... Amazon doesn't seem to think it's an issue since the seller can charge whatever they want for the item.  I disagree, and think it's Amazon's responisbility to get to the bottom of this."
negative,10/8/18,"This food is phenomenal but WAY overpriced. I pay $7.99 a case in New York City and it is often on sale for less than $6 a case at BabiesRus in New York City. Grocery prices are obscene in NY so if I am paying less here, this is no deal."
positive,15/1/20,We have been looking for pesto that tastes as good as what we had in Tuscany. This is from the same region as our favorite. The consistency is just a bit runny. It has moderate chunks of garlic. It was quite tasty!
positive,1/9/20,"Yuban is one of the best coffees available, but not sold in all areas. Amazon's case price is unbeatable!!  I get a case every 8 weeks, always on time!!"
positive,22/7/21,"I'm constantly trying to find vanilla beans at a reasonable price. Often, when I do, they are hard as rocks, dry, and practically unusable.  I was so frustrated at Safeway where one bean was $13(!), dry and hard as a rock. The best I've found was at Trader Joe's, where I could get three beans for $10. They were decent...<br /><br />This price was SO reasonable, that I worried they were not going to be fresh/good/etc. I was wrong. The beans were incredibly fresh and supple. I'm using them to make vanilla extract and they have worked perfectly. They keep well in the fridge, so I'm using them in everything!<br /><br />The price is great, but there might be too many to use--if that's the case, then split them with a friend. Then it becomes one of the best culinary deals ever.<br /><br />Absolutely wonderful. I will buy these again and again."
positive,1/7/18,I received these wonderful beans today through Amazon.  I have not opened the vacuum sealed bag yet but the fragrance is divine.  They are about 6-3/4 inches long and plump and soft. It looks like there are maybe 60-70 beans.
positive,10/8/18,"I got these 2 weeks ago, for the price i wasnt expecting much, but they are really fresh and fragrant<br />i've used them to make bavarian cream and creme brulee and they taste great."
positive,14/5/21,This is the buy of a lifetime.  $25 for about 50 beans instead of $10 for 2!  And the flavor was great.  Made ice cream that everyone raved about.  I vacuum sealed portions for future use to keep them as fresh as possible.
positive,17/10/19,"My 3 Boston Terriers LOVE these treats!  They are natural, wholesome and soft enough to break into multiple pieces.  We keep a steady supply of them in the house ... I order at least 2 containers at a time since we don't want to run out.  Amazon's seller -- All Pets -- has the best price around."
positive,3/10/21,"I started loving Oolong tea after I discovered a bottled product called 'Tejava'. That product is over a dollar for a 12 ounce bottle. I needed something less expensive so I tried this 'Prince of Peace' brand Oolong.<br /><br />After a few brewing experiments, I now love this stuff.<br /><br />What I have learned; If brewing as 'sun tea' this type of tea seems to come out very weak. If you put this tea in boiling water, it may come out bitter.<br /><br />I now heat up my water in a microwave until it is, very hot to the touch, but no way near boiling. I then put in the tea bags and let it brew for about twenty minutes (I like strong tea). I have, to my taste, duplicated the 'Tejava' brew at a fraction of the original cost.<br /><br />Enjoy<br /><br />Ken"
positive,15/9/20,"great product and priced well, we've ordered this several times over the past few years and really like their walnut oil,  packaged well and ships on time, will keep ordering this product from the same seller"
positive,30/8/20,I love the walnut oil. It came in cans which i like a lot because you hardly see them any more. The walnut oil was better quality than any of the walnut oil I bought in my neighbourhood and cheaper even with the shipping charge. I recommend it to anyone.
positive,1/7/18,"One of my favorite salad recipes I make often calls for walnut oil.  I bought a small bottle from a local major grocery store and it was over $10 for about 6 ounces.  Steep!  I love walnuts so naturally I loved this oil from my very first taste.  But the price was not right so I searched on the Internet and found this.  I was a little reluctant to buy 3 cans as I thought they go rancid before I can finish but I am now on my last can.  I use it in place of EVOO to make other vinaigrettes too.  Or just splash this walnut oil and my favorite raspberry vinegar and B&S (or seasons salt like Krazy Salt) over spring mix, it is an easy but great green salad! I do this a lot when I need a quick side. Anyway, this oil goes well with anything and it does not taste too nutty.  Just a touch of nice walnut flavor (of course, I love walnuts so even if it tastes very ""walnutty,"" I would still like it!)<br /><br />Anyway, it is a great product and I will buy the same pack again!"
negative,10/8/18,"I bought these for my wife for her birthday, she LOVES chocolate and its a staple gift I give her. Well this year I got her these. She only ate one, and put them away. Very strange. Later I caught her putting them in the garbage. When I tried one I quickly realized why, they taste like they have no sugar in them, and leave an aftertaste that reminded me of badly burnt toast. I had to brush my teeth to get the taste out. We had a good laugh about it. Fortunately I also gave her a necklace which she really did love so they didn't ruin her birthday. 43 dollars wasted."
negative,5/12/19,"The advertised regular price of $99.99 is ridiculous.  5 hour energy drinks are widely available for $2.00 each.  Don't buy from sellers who inflate prices and charge ridiculous amounts.  You can get a case of 12 for $20 right here on Amazon."
positive,21/10/19,"Trying something new with this coffee. Didn't blow me away but for the price, it's excellent. I don't have anything bad to say about it other than it's a BIG bag and I am mildly concerned with freshness toward the end, but we burn thru beans pretty fast =D"
positive,8/9/20,"Tea's are very personal and everyone has their favorites. I really enjoy this tea when relaxing, or before bed. The subtle mint flavor seems to comfort and sooth. A little sugar (I'm not a fan of honey) really makes all the flavors POP! Being a fan of this tea it was a no brainer to order it in bulk, the price at the time was great, cheaper then the grocery store (by far). The packaging was efficient and made it really easy to store."
negative,22/9/21,"I love all different types of beef jerky, but not this one.  It has the flavor of grocery store bought beef jerky once you get over the overwhelming taste of salt. These sticks are cut thin making them tender and easy to chew, but they're just way too salty and definitely not worth $20"
positive,2/10/20,"This ""squeezy fruit"" as my daughter calls it, is great.  Convenient, yummy, no added sugar...I love it.  I just don't understand why it is so expensive??  I find it at the grocery store for $2 for a four pack.  Don't pay this price, that's crazy!"
negative,25/7/20,"Skittles are a great candy but for this product i would say do not buy it here, I have seen this same bag for $5.89 on sale and not on sale for $7.99 at some big chain stores. the candies themselves are fine and if you are thinking of getting a big bag you know what they taste like just don't overspend to get a big bag (price wise might be cheaper to buy a bunch of little bags)"
negative,4/7/21,"i have enjoyed this product for quite some time.  however, i am disgusted by the fact that the price keeps increasing!  at $35 per case, customers are paying more than $4 per box for 5 small cookie bars - ridiculous!  i will find a healthier, more reasonably priced snack to munch on. shame on nana and amazon. . ."
negative,11/9/21,"I decided to give these a try.  The lids are VERY difficult to put on and I often ended up bending the cup while trying to affix the lid.  They do not seal perfectly and I often found unexpected puddles, but they do the job.  Since I have a Keurig permanant filter I thought of just buying the paper filters to save on cleanup.  For almost $11 from this vendor, you can get 50 (fifty) paper filters.....I would just assume use paper towels.  That works out to be just under 25 cents for a small piece of paper....DisposaKups, please re-evaluate your pricing!"
positive,4/7/21,"Amazon has the best price in town.  Hot nuts that don't disappoint.  I would recommend trying Dave's other items as well.  Great flavor."
positive,21/9/21,"This is one of the best hot dogs made, unfortunatally it is not widely available.  Citymade must be off their rocker if they think people are gonna sale hot dogs for such a crazy price.  Granted there is 30+ weiners in a package, still a stupid price."
positive,11/9/21,"The stuff is great but I'll pay at most $4 or $5 for four bottles."
positive,12/10/21,"These raw shelled pumpkin seed kernels actually have a slight pumpkin flavor which I assume indicates that they are fresh, unlike the store bought (H-E-B) raw kernels that were pretty bland. They are also extremely nutritious: high in iron, protein and fiber. Actually, pumpkin seed kernels have four times the iron and about 25% more protein than beef per 100 gram. The price produces somewhat of a sticker shock, though, at over seven bucks per pound; however, considering all of the fiber and nutrients, I believe they are well worth the price. Bob's Red Mill has the nutrition facts displayed on his web site.

I suspect most of us do not have the palates to appreciate the $300 truffles. Good for those of you who do. But for the rest of us, this is a good choice.<br />Linda Morse"
positive,28/9/21,"Always used the Robertsons ginger, This production is almost as good, but the price is inflated for the size of the jar.the product was packed well (glass jars) and arrived promptly."
negative,19/10/21,"You can order the same products online from Nespresso for approx $25 AND you can specify exactly what you want to buy rather than taking a mixture of items, some of which you may not like.<br /><br />Nespresso makes GREAT coffee and GREAT machines. The Nespresso capsule offers posted on Amazon however are all by third parties who prey on people who don't know better."
positive,4/7/21,"My 4 border collies expect one of these each night before bed.  I've learned how important it is to create regular routines to keep these active ""wired"" dogs calm, and there's no way I have time to brush their teeth each nite, even if they'd let me.  But this can get very expensive.  When I found them here at this price, I ordered tons.  Then went back and ordered more, figuring the price would increase to that on other sites.  It had increased a bit, but still a great price. Entirely Pets delivered a bit late due to supply problems, but that was okay since I had just received enough to last a month!"
positive,11/9/21,"I have always been a fan of Annie's products, and since I'm overseas at the moment, I didn' have access to the products. That's where Amazon comes in! The price is very good-almost the same as buying them in the store in the states-and the product came in great shape and the expiration date is not soon either!<br />As for the product itself, I think the sauce can use less salt, but other wise I love it! Natural ingredients and it takes less than 10 minutes for me to make it =)"
positive,12/9/21,"This is a great price for powdered goat milk. At the local health food store (the only place in town that carries goat milk), I buy just one of these cans for $15. $20 for three cans is the best price I've found!<br /><br />I use goat milk for my children, when they are in the process of weaning, and as long as they want it. It is so much healthier than formula because, well, it's not soy or dairy based, and has no chemicals and added vitamins that try to mimic breastmilk. Goat milk is more similar to breastmilk than dairy, so is much easier for humans to digest than cow milk. I find it to be a great alternative for babies as they adjust, or for those who cannot tolerate dairy.<br /><br />For warm bottles for my 14-month-old, I just heat water on the stove, then pour it into her glass bottle with a scoop of goat milk. Shake it up and she has her favorite drink (Other than momma's milk, of course)!"
positive,13/7/21,"This is a great deal for the amount of pretzel packs that are given. We love these since they're only 100 calories each and perfect for a snack, pair with a sandwich, or just to stick in your purse if you get hungry."
negative,23/10/21,I can get this at my local grocery store for $2.69 per can ($32.28 for 12).
positive,22/9/21,"I got this product for consumption, I took some of the store bought baking soda and did not know it is loaded with aluminum, so glad I was able to find this product thru amazon, and after reading all the positive reviews I got it and started taking some with a glass of water, great product,fast delivery,great price, very happy with my purchase."
positive,4/7/21,"I've drunk whole-bean Tanzanian peaberry for about 20 years.  My first source was the large national retailer and wholesaler Green Mountain, which roasted their Tanzanian peaberry light to medium.  Although the beans made good coffee, Green Mountain's price eventually became higher than I thought reasonable.  An internet seach led me to a small family-owned and family-operated roaster in Tennessee.  Their beans were also light to medium and, thus, had a dry appearance.  That level of roasting was to my liking because the beans retain more caffeine, and the natural flavor of the coffee is more apparent than with darker roasts.  When the Tennessee roaster's computer system crashed and online sales were temporarily suspended, I did another internet search and found Amazon's Tanzanian peaberry roasted by Coffee Bean Direct.  It has essentially the same good taste as the Tanzanian peaberry from the Tennessee roaster, and the price is lower.  I'm totally satisfied with the beans roasted by Coffee Bean Direct, and the shipping by Amazon is quick enough that buying three pounds at a time allows me to place my next order before the current one runs out."
positive,11/9/21,"These individually packed milk is great for on-the-road.  Does not need to be stored in the frig.  This item came in 6 packs of 3.  Then shipped in its original box and then another Amazon box over it.  The content was securely packed and I was not worried that the milk got 'dirty' during shipping.  The price is the same as in local grocery store but shipping to the house saved me from dragging them from the store while my toddler is jumping up and down the store aisle. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because of the expiration date.  It is Mar 2012 which is not too far away.  I just bought one from Target(because I forgot to bring one and my toddler was restless) and it has an expiration date of Sept 2012.  Overall, I would still recommend to buy from Amazon."
positive,8/8/21,"I'm new to tofu, newly vegan, and was dismayed at the price of tofu in local health food stores and the scarcity of it in regular grocery stores. I was hesitant to purchase in bulk, but am so glad I did. I purchased both the soft and the firm versions, and it has been great in every recipe! I will definitely be ordering again!"
negative,9/7/21,"I love these crackers but not the price change.<br /><br />At $29.00 for 12 boxes; ~$2.42 a box if you sign up for ""Subscribe and Save"" I was ecstatic. I most definitely signed up for ""Subscribe and Save"" delivery.<br /><br />Not yet 2 months later I learn the identical item now cost $55.00 for 12 boxes.<br /><br />Bait and switch?<br /><br />I think these crackers taste better than their clone parent the Triscuit. 12 boxes is just right for a two month period- I keep a couple boxes at work. Use them for bringing nibblies to gatherings and more importantly as a stable of my diet because I choose not to eat bread and I love food items with ingredient lists like this: Whole Wheat, Expeller-Pressed Oleic Safflower Oil, Sea Salt, Natural Tocopherols Added to Preserve Freshness.<br /><br />As a big city dweller who uses public trans (I don't own a car)I rely on Amazon for certain essential groceries. I pick them up at the UPS store on my walk home from the train stop. It's one of the main reasons I'm a ""Prime"" member.<br /><br />I'll need to cancel my ""Subscribe and Save"" for this item. I like to think Amazon wasn't going to send the next delivery without notifying me of the new price.<br /><br />I can get Triscuits anywhere for ~$4.50 a box, sometimes less. The Back To Nature cracker is now $4.59 a box.<br /><br />It's likely the pricing situation is out of their hands but I'm so disappointed!<br /><br />Looks like I'll be checking out the cracker selection at CostCo."
negative,24/10/21,I used to order this product at 25 per box of 12 cans and now it turned into 50 dollars??? how did it double out of nowhere??
positive,4/7/21,I buy these with subscribe and save.  I like the flavor and aroma.  Going on month two and I am not tired of them yet!
positive,11/9/21,"I do like this coffee, but even with Subscribe and Save, Amazon's price is higher than K-cups at Bed Bath & Beyond.  Convenience is one thing, but since there are BB&Bs all around me, it's pretty easy to pick up my coffee there and save a few bucks.  I wish Amazon would price their coffees more competitively - I'd buy here exclusively if they did.  But this is good, medium roast coffee.  Not quite as strong as I'd like, but a little stronger than the Breakfast in Bed version.  I may need to try Sorrento and see if it's a little bolder."
positive,24/10/21,"A nutritionist recommended these to sweeten my coffee etc. as there are no negative after effects unlike artificial sweeteners.  Stevia is made from herb in South America. Japanese tea drinkers have been using stevia for years with no ill effects she said.  It's quite a bit sweeter than sugar, so you need less of it as a replacement.<br /><br />I like this brand and put two packets in my iced coffee every morning with almond milk and 1 T cocoa--it tastes like a coffee milk shake for only about 70 calories as the Stevia is calorie-free! The stevia makes it taste like an iced dessert drink and is a great, refreshing treat for the day.<br /><br />This multi-pack offer for this price is about 30% lower than what I can get NuStevia for locally."
negative,22/6/21,"When I bought this food, I saw the image and price and assumed that I would be paying a fair price ($1 less per bag than the grocery store) for low grade cat food. The image and price combination led me to think that I would be paying $45 for 6 18lb+ bags - a good deal. When I received six 3.6lb bags, I thought there had been a mistake. Nope. So, I spend $40+ returning it (I bought three 6 packs - oops) and now Ozbo customer service tells me they take 2-3 weeks processing returns! My kitties need food now, and these people want to sit on my $180 for that long? DO NOT BUY FROM THESE SCAMMERS !!!"
negative,30/7/21,"This is a good product, especially for iced coffee, but why is it twice the price as it is in stores?  This isn't a fluke--within the past two months I've bought it for $5 a jar in Seattle and in Nevada, so it just looks like good old-fashioned gouging.  Try harder Amazon."
positive,10/7/21,"I am very fond of this coffee, and I won't accept substitutes for it. Several of my local stores have substituted another brand. I just order it on-line when I cannot get it in a store. HOWEVER, Amazon's price is too high. It's $4 a jar in local stores."
positive,4/7/21,"Is this $21.99 price for a single 2-ounce jar or for a 6-pack?  The description only indicates that the price is for 2 ounces, which, of course, is ridiculously expensive. But it's a good deal if it's for a 6-pack.  Previous buyers, can you please advise?  The coffee itself is excellent; I usually buy it in the store and was hoping to find a deal on Amazon."
positive,11/9/21,"This is a great product, but $21 for 2oz. Really? You can get it from other sellers or at the grocery store for $6-7. Show this price-gouger what the market will really bear!"
positive,20/9/21,So far this has been a great way to order my favorite coffee.  It has become really hard to find it at the local stores but Amazon had it even cheaper than I previously paid for it.  It arrived very quickly and I am waiting any day now for the next shipment.
positive,13/10/21,"This food looks just like something you would make for your pet at a Thanksgiving day dinner!  I was impressed with it when I opened the can, and my cats were when they ate it.  It contains nice size pieces of shredded turkey...not too big, making it easy for my kitties to eat.  They have gotten the Tiki cat chicken before and the long stringy pieces in that kept them busy for a little bit and they seemed kind of tough even for me when I would try to break them up.  Not this, I just spooned it into their bowls and they took over from there.  There is liquid around the sides of the food in the center, but the meat/vege mix in the middle is well packed.  I didn't feel like I was getting more liquid than food, like Halo foods so I was happy about that as well.  Plus, through amazon, this is a great price for this quality food."
positive,2/8/21,"I've tried several brands and this is true to the taste of fresh coconut water, though slightly more dilute.  The ""wholesale"" price here doesn't make much sense to me.  It's about $5.75 per liter in an 12 pack.  I get it for $4.99 at Publix.  The only disadvantage is that they only have maybe 4 or 5 at a time, but I'm one of few buying it and I sweep the shelves of it (LOL).<br />  I'm 37 weeks pregnant and this helps decrease the swelling in my legs and keeps me well hydrated.  I don't experience any leg cramps like I did during my first pregnancy.  I think the potassium makes a huge difference.  And with a tendency towards gestational diabetes, the low sugar content vs. other sports drinks is a huge advantage.  They should market this directly to pregnant women with diabetes (with no renal issues)."
positive,11/6/21,I get these for $4.34 at my local health food store - their price sucks!  It is one of the best tasting coconut waters around though!
positive,2/8/21,"If you want 100% Kopi Luwak, this is a good method to acquire some in a relatively cheap manner. It's not as good as some of the stuff I've had, but it's definitely in that special class that Kopi Luwak belongs in. I've served this for guest, given it as gifts, and enjoyed it on special occasions. I've made it in French press, drip, and in one special instance Espresso!<br /><br />To truly enjoy it, use about 8 grams of beans per 7 ounces of hot water used to brew. This is the appropriate ratios. Serve black, no cream or sugar as this will ruin your treat. This bean isn't for everyone, but don't worry! It's not an acquired taste, its just a different taste :-)<br /><br />Product arrived fast thank to prime, fresh as I wanted, and the beans tasted just like they do when I buy them locally from Rao's Bakery here in TX (same beans same company)."
positive,18/10/21,"This has become our new coffee of choice for the mornings.  It's a good price for a solid cup of organic coffee.  Beans are medium roast and very fragrant."
positive,23/7/21,"I am not much on stuff like this, but having some issued that I think this item will take care of, I got some here - local shops did not carry it, prices at flea markets and food shops were - just to high. The price from Amazon was very good.<br />I no longer have need of this item - but if the condition returns - so will I, HERE!"
negative,8/7/21,I bought this product not that many months ago and loved it BUT no longer buying this brand because it doubled in price! I bought it for $10 originally. Will buy another brand.
positive,11/6/21,"These may last forever at 1T every day in my morning shake since I'm having trouble finding recipes for other ways to use these seeds, but they will keep (in a sealed plastic container)."
negative,25/6/21,"This is a great product... my baby loves it. I especially like the smooth liquid formula versus the powder since the powder never seems to dissolve properly.<br /><br />I am, however, rating this low because of the SELLER... $55 is RIDICULOUS! This product normally sells for $25-$32. But they are jacking up the price because there is a shortage of the liquid formula due to the powder recall.<br /><br />YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED AMAZON!!!! This is food for a BABY! Makes me ill."
positive,2/8/21,"Kinda expensive for cheese product...would expect ssomething closer to the $3 per pound price I can get in the supermarket, but it is so versatile...can be used in any recipe that calls for cheese.<br /><br />My favorite use is to SUPER-CHEESE both store brand and even Kraft boxed mac-n-cheese...sometimes that little packet of cheese powder just doesn't give me the cheese-i-ness I want...so after mixing the mac-n-cheese according to the directions on the box, I put a few slices of Velveeta on top, nuke it for a few minutes, mix it in, and VIOLA..!! Try it, you'll never want to eat mac-n-cheese out of the box again."
negative,11/6/21,"I spent close to $4.00 for each cube which turned out to be the 16oz size.  I know it says that upon further review but I was assuming it was the 3lb size because that size is $3.99 at the grocery.  And I just paid the same thing for the 1lb size?!  Shame on you Amazon.  Or better yet shame on me.  The expiration date is fast approaching too so I'm not even sure I'll use these up in a month.  I was very disappointed in the price as well as the expiration date.  I had the same issue with some sunflower seeds I bought recently, they expired before baseball season even started.  However, I did get what I paid for...it's just my mistake for not realizing the size was not what I thought I was getting.  Who would pay that for the 1lb size?"
positive,9/7/21,"Costco stopped carrying this near me, so when I found out it was on amazon for cheaper, I was so excited.<br /><br />It came pretty quick, was at an unbeatable price, and was the same good hot cereal I got from the Costco (no damage or anything)."
positive,22/6/21,I have purchased green coffee beans from several local and internet providers often with poor results.  U-Roast-Em is the exception. I have never had bad service with this company and now purchase all of my coffee from them.  They provide an excellent selection of high quality beans at great prices.  They do a great job with packaging and shipping!  Most of my orders have shipped the same day I ordered.<br /><br />I have tried most of their coffees and have yet to be disappointed.  If you are looking for a good mid priced coffee I would recommend La Minita Tarrazu de Costa Rica.<br /><br />I highly recommend you check out U-Roast-Em for all your coffee needs!
positive,2/8/21,"Nutiva Organic Hemp Seeds are so good for you.  They are 33% protein, 9% Omega 3, and GLA.  I think the MSRP on these bags is $14 each so Amazon has these priced at almost half-price!  This is a great affordable way to get some healthy proteins and fats.<br /><br />Amazon sent me very fresh product.  I subscribed-n-saved on July 22nd and it arrived via OnTrac on July 24th.  The Nutiva Hempseed package says it was packed on may 19, 2012 and is best before may 18, 2013.  Pretty fresh product and tastes fresh, too.<br /><br />Sprinkle on top of your  cereal, omelets, yogurt, soups, salads, and veggies.<br /><br />Hemp seeds require no advance soaking to derive optimal nutritional benefit.<br /><br />Here is a great way to enjoy Hemp:<br />1cup hemp seeds<br />1 cup spring water<br />1Tbsp maple syrup, honey, stevia, or your favorite sweetneer<br />dash himalyan salt<br />optional flavoriing = cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, cardamom<br /><br />Combine all in a blender and blend well until a creamy white milk forms.  Pour through a strainer to remove any husk residue.  Will keep in refrigerator for 4-5 days but I recommend preparing small batches right when you want to drink them as fresh is the most tasty and most nutritious.  You could also make a great milk out of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0084QP4T4"">Cinnamon Red Maca Almond Butter</a>"
positive,11/6/21,"I love this gravy mix - much easier and less fat than making from scratch and not as salty as McCormick's or other brands.<br /><br />I use non-fat milk instead of water to make a cream gravy.  This is good stuff.  And by time you order this set of 24 and other items, there is no shipping and no tax.  The price is much less than I could get when on sale at my local supermarket."
negative,8/7/21,"Very disappointed in this.  Heed the bad reviews.  I am now at the lowest amount of brewing and it still tastes watered down.  Need to dump some Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate in there to give it flavor and that point, what was the purpose.  With the product already being overpriced (shop elsewhere)as it was and tasting watered down; it just wasn't worth it.  Skip it!  Maybe a different brand will be better."
positive,28/9/21,"I love this stuff.  There isn't an instant coffee out there that's anywhere near this good.  This isn't even in the same category as any other instant.  It actually tastes like real coffee!  Shocking, but true.  It's (no lie) almost as good as freshly brewed Starbucks.  It's also great for iced coffee and for adding to smoothies and other recipes that call for a coffee kick.  However, the stuff is so darned expensive that I feel foolish buying it.  Unfortunately, it has to be a special splurge when my budget allows."
positive,23/8/21,"Compared to what I pay at the normal grocery store for almonds, these are priced great, and taste fresh and crunchy. The sea salt taste is perfect, and the containers are conviently sized."
negative,1/8/21,"During my recent visit to New Orleans in June of 2012, I fell in love with Etouffee' sauce on redfish.  Oh my goodness. Delicious.  I picked up a few packages of the Louisiana Cajun Etouffee Mix, for $2.00 per package, and made it at home. It was fantastic.  I ordered the product on Amazon from a particular seller and for the price of more than 7 dollars, was delivered one package. The product description on the website did not clarify the number of packages to be delivered for this amount...I assumed three packages for that price. I received one package and returned it to them immediately.  You can purchase this product on line from the retailer for less than two dollars per package with free shipping.  So, avoid purchasing this via this seller.  Great product however."
positive,16/7/21,"This is a must have in my home.  I use olive oil for everything, my skin, hair, cooking, taking off makeup. This is great, quality organic, virgin olive oil and I'm in heaven!"
positive,2/8/21,"I made prunes a permanent part of my diet because (a) they are promoted as the best food source of antioxidants, and (b) because they're very sweet and serve as a good sugar substitute for when you have sugar cravings. They're also supposed to be good, um, um, against constipation, so be careful. I usually eat a couple at a time, and never more than four; never a problem within these limits. They're nice to add to oatmeal too, along with bananas and raisins (or instead of raisins). Raisins are also a good antioxidant, in fact, second best after prunes, about half as strong.<br /><br />I've tried many kinds of prunes and so far Sunsweet are the best: I like their taste best; consistency is good (neither too mushy nor dried up like cardboard); they keep up well (I do keep thim in the fridge, but that's strictlyl speaking, unnecessary -- they'll be fine for a couple of weeks in the open, and they taste better at room temperature), and the product quality is consistent, no surprises.<br /><br />I buy them in stores, where an 18 oz canister usually costs between four and five bucks. This page wants thirty? Well, this must be some sort of error... I expect an online price to be better, not six-to-seven times what I can get locally. So, my bottomline is: this sort of prunes is very good, but pick them up at your local grocery store, not here. In fact, I got them a few times on sale for like two-seventy a piece, in a local drugstore, believe it or not. Be very careful with prices here: first, they jump around quite a bit; and second, if you subscribe, and the price goes up, they'll just go ahead and charge you more w/o bothering to ask you if you agree to pay more. Avoid subscriptions 'cause, yeah, they'll give you an extra 15% discount -- and  next month will jack up the price by 50%. It's a racket, so stay clear.<br /><br />PS. Just discovered: Trader Joe's carries pitted prunes too: a resealable plastic bag holds one pound (16 oz) and costs two-eighty-nine. That's about one tenth of what this guy above wants. Bemuzing, to say the least."
positive,11/6/21,"I'll certainly be a repeat customer. I had a tough time finding large salt crystals to refill a grinder, but this fit the bill nicely.<br /><br />Flavor is clean with slight minerality. The color is not a deep as some other himalayan pink I've seen, but it's a very good finishing salt, and a good conversation piece when put on the table in a clear grinder.<br /><br />Also, the seller included a coupon for a future purchase in the package, which was a nice bonus."
positive,26/6/21,"I got this at a GREAT PRICE. I paid $8.67 ($10.20 without Subscribe and save) for 3 boxes that contain 4 separate 24oz bags. So you see, is a whole bunch of cookies. I'm abroad but I hear that my stepson's reaction was WOW, they'll all be gone tomorrow (teenager - resembles a bottomless pit) but it was a very good price. Cookies are fresh and packaging as appropriate. Will buy again.<br />Btw, i just saw that the price on this was $29.95(My favorite things LLC), refresh a couple of times till you see $10.20, (fulfilled by amazon.com)"
negative,20/8/21,"Item appears to be Keurig brand by title & description (big $$$).  However upon receiving it, it is an off brand ""My Perfect Kitchen"" sold at Bed Bath & Beyond and at HALF the price. I was disappointed in the jading and sent it back. Signed up for BBB email promos and got a 20% off coupon for use in the store so I bought this EXACT item for $20 (reg only $24.99 in store).  I mean EXACT!  Do your homework and save yourself some money.  Oh and the item itself is great...we have the larger Platinum B70 and it does have an issue with the cupboards but I just pulled it forward about 3.5in and it's perfect.  I am fortunate enough to have a lot of counter space and I may move it to an open top area so for us it's all good :)"
positive,25/8/21,"This product is well worth the money.  Others carry a similar product that's cheaper, but the quality is way cheaper also."
positive,19/10/21,I bought this one until I saw one exactly like it at a big box store (think red bullseye) for 24.99. This is going back!
positive,2/8/21,"I don't buy my walnuts anywhere else. These taste great and are a fantastic price. I put most of them in the freezer and pull them out as I need them in order to ensure they stay fresh since 4 tubs lasts me quite a while."
positive,11/6/21,"Great product at a great price.  Subscribe and save makes this an exceptional buy.  And oh yeah, my dogs love these too!"
positive,22/10/21,"My Jack Russell has problems with patella luxation. I decided against surgery after researching the success rate of it and 5 years after it was diagnosed she is still OK. I keep her weight down and give her plenty of long walks to stengthen her ligaments. The vet told me she would probably have problems with arthritis so I give her one of these chicken strips daily and also give her liquid glucosamine choindroitin on a small piece of bread. My dog loves the chicken strips, the price on Amazon is better than me buying the indivdual packs from the store and having the glucosamine in it is another way for me to administer glucosamine to her in a way that is tasty."
positive,6/8/21,"I bought this for cooking; from whipping egg whites to making my own baking powder, this cream of tartar is great.  I put some in a small jar in my cupboard for everyday use, the remainder I keep sealed tightly in the freezer.  It will last quite a long time, and buying it this way is exponentially less expensive than buying the small, over-priced jars in the grocery market."
positive,24/6/21,"I got the same product at my local grocery store for $9.99. Much cheaper - what's going on Amazon? You aren't even offering a bulk price. Great product, my dogs love them too, but can be found much cheaper elsewhere."
positive,17/4/21,"I purchased the same bag from the vet for $10.  When my dog was diagnosed with Addison's disease I concludeded that I would need to use the pill pockets for the rest of his life.  Not only do they work; he wouldn't take the prednisone in cheese or other foods, but you do not need to use the entire pill each time.  I just break away enough so that it covers his pill and he loves it!  Great product at a great price!"
positive,10/3/21,"The price for these K-Cups is great. They are so costly in the store, so this is a great way to buy in bulk."
negative,17/4/21,"Quality is OK but if you need maltodextring in larger but not huge quantities, buy Carbo Gain from NOW Foods. Much better bang for the buck."
positive,21/1/21,Product is good and came in a timely matter. The price was way higher than at the Asian store. I found it for a 1/3rd of the price. So I can buy 3 5lb bags at the store compared to this price for the same amount.
positive,30/1/21,"Very reasonable price for an outstanding product. Checked<br />many other retailers locally and online. I can honestly say without a doubt, that I received the best value for the 20 pack coconut bars!"
positive,13/2/21,"This is the best price I've found for PB2 and it's eligible for free shipping and handling.<br />It tastes better than another powdered peanut butter product that I've tried."
positive,15/1/21,A treat for my dogs that is actually good for them. Also at much better price than I had found previously at my local retailers....Great product at a huge savings - what could be better!
positive,6/3/21,I ordered 2 bags of this item and paid $12.50 per bag.  When I received it I saw it came from Trader Joes. So the next time I needed some I went to our local Trader Joes and paid $3.99 per bag.  Unbelievable!!!
positive,8/6/21,this is a great price and the delivery was super fast i first found these in yosemite at a much higher price & limeted QTY.
positive,7/1/21,"If you use the Dolce Gusto machine Amazon is the place to buy the coffee. You'll get the best price and super fast shipping. And if you setup a subscription for the coffee you'll even get a better price!"
positive,17/4/21,"Yes indeed do buyt hese, no dented cans,, and great price!..No grocery store can match this one,,Will always order these potatoes from here,,"
positive,10/3/21,Our yorkie and shitzu love greenies and the price at amazon is significantly lower than what I can find at petsmart or Petco. I will continue to buy from Amazon
positive,14/1/21,My two dogs adore Greenies!  This seemed to be the best place & price I found online.  Very quickly shipped too.
positive,24/5/21,I like to buy Greenies for my dog but they are very expensive even in multi-packs. If you purchase at online pet stores they are somewhat less expensive but not like the boxes offered on Amazon.  Dogs need clean teeth and healthy gums and Greenies will take care of both.  Easily digestible for my 13 year old Shi-Tzu.
positive,14/10/21,Buying the greenies online is the way to go..  They cost about $10 cheaper than if you were to walk into a chain pet store.
positive,7/2/21,I found this site to have the best price for the quantities on the web. I would definitely order from here again.
positive,29/3/21,"I buy these locally, and they are more expensive than Amazon.com.<br />My dog likes them and we do see a difference in her teeth.<br />Thanks."
positive,17/4/21,"I use Agave Nectar for my Margaritas so I have this on 'Subscribe and Save' which is a great option. It comes to me automatically just when I need it at a discounted price. It was damaged only one time out of 4 shipments and it was re-shipped in time for my needs. You can't beat this price anywhere. Love it!"
positive,10/3/21,"So glad to find this product at a sensible price.  A bit less flavor, being ""light,"" but still a good taste and so much better for you than many alternatives."
positive,10/7/21,"Oh my gosh I had been buying 8oz bottles for $4.99 at the local grocery store when I discovered the excellent price at Amazon!  Even if you give one away it's a better deal than that!  I use agave in my fruit smoothies and this brand is excellent.  A light taste that adds the perfect sweetness."
negative,27/1/21,"You can buy the same bag of chocolate at any Michaels store for $2.99.  I got a ton of bags on sale for $1.99 there!  Don't waste your money or your time waiting for this bag"
positive,1/6/21,"My son loves the Gerber breakfast buddies, so I purchased an 8 pack of each flavor. I love them because they are very convenient and still nutritious. However, local stores sell these for $.20 less than Amazon."
negative,20/8/21,"I can't believe anyone is buying this stuff at Amazon!!!  Go to Keurig.com and pay half of this price.  Spread the word because this is rediculous!"
positive,14/8/21,Amazon has a hell of a nerve charging $60 for a case of 6 happy bellies cereal when anywhere else it is $3.19 each can!!
negative,21/4/21,they are charging $1.00 per k-cup i saw this and decided to go to Keurig.com and these same k-cups are half price
negative,1/4/21,"Product is ok, but I consider it very expensive for a small plastic item!  If I had seen the product in person, I never would have paid that much for it."
negative,17/4/21,"I really like this coffee but,I'll be dammed if I'm going to pay $91.8 cents a cup<br />just to support GM's stock price.I hope whatever they're smoking over in corporate<br />is worth it.."
negative,10/3/21,They are taking advantage of pricing and selling this item at 200% mark up. You can get it at Keurig.com at half the price
positive,22/4/21,"I got this at Sams for $15 cheaper, shipped, but hopefully they adjust the price on here soon because I prefer using Amazon to order my goodies."
positive,25/4/21,"Since there is a national shortage of canned pumpkin, I was very happy to find an online source for this product. Our dog needs the pumpkin to keep her digestive tract regular and she loves it. This is a great product at a great price."
positive,1/4/21,"I love to make pumpkin muffins and bread. I first ordered this product over a year ago when pumpkin was hard to find in the store. Although I like to use natural/organic products, pumpkin is not necessarily one of those things that you need to have organic (due to the thick rind). However, the price of this is impossible to pass up - with S&S, the per can price is cheaper than the local store generic! I didn't think there was much of a difference in taste, until recently I made my muffins with another ""name brand"" pumpkin-my muffins were just OK, certainly not as yummy as usual. The pumpkin was the only difference. So here I am ordering more! Unless the price shoots up dramatically, I won't use anything else.<br /><br />I didn't realize the dented can thing was a widespread issue. If I remember correctly, I do think some of my cans in my first order were dented, but not badly enough to make them unusable (obviously - we've eaten them all with delicious results and no ill effects LOL!)<br /><br />UPDATE: This latest order arrived in perfect shape in a well reinforced box - no dents or dings anywhere!"
negative,30/6/21,"What can I say that you probably don't already know?  It's Monster, a caffeine drink that is mostly sugar water.<br /><br />The problem is that I can find this MUCH cheaper in regular stores."
positive,1/3/21,This is a great price for Grade B maple.  I bought it for the Lemonade Diet and found it to be good to the last drop!
positive,29/1/21,We use a lot of Organic Maple Syrup and this was a brand recommended and Amazon Subscribe and Save had the best per ounce price!  I love not having to think about stocking up on items I buy all the time!
positive,17/4/21,I paid twice this with my Vet great price and my  dogs love them
positive,10/3/21,"I have had better tasting organic tea, but it's not bad and very good price."
positive,30/5/21,"I've got 2 Golden Retrievers that stand at the cabinet door after their dinner waiting for these things. They love them. And they really do clean their teeth!"
negative,28/9/21,"I feel like you don't get enough noodles for the money.  It is incredibly expensive, there aren't that many noodles, and I did NOT feel full from this.  The noodles do smell once you take them out of the package; however, they cook up rather easily.  They will stick together - so when you take them out of the water and put them on paper towels, make sure that you lay them out - otherwise, you will have issues later.  They do NOT have a taste, so make sure that you stir fry them or let them simmer with whatever you are using them with, otherwise, you will be disappointed.  Sorry, but I won't buy them again - too much money."
negative,6/5/21,"This is $14 worth of creamer at best. Sams Club has 50 oz of coffeemate creamer for only $6.32 this is 110 oz of creamer for $51, Do the math."
positive,20/4/21,These syrup pumps are sometimes hard to find and when I have found them the price is ridiculously high.  I am pleased to have found these at a reasonable price.
positive,20/4/21,"I was a little apprehensive purchasing this entire 3 lb+ can for consumption by only 2 people. However, now that we've eaten about half the can in a week, I can say that my concern was not valid :)<br /><br />I LOVE castelvetrano olives, and this brand is fantastic! My plan was to follow the recommendation of another reviewer, and put the olives in a glass jar with water to reduce the brine. But, at the rate we are devouring them, I don't believe that will be necessary.<br /><br />My only regret is that I didn't purchase more at the same time. I'll stock up on my next purchase."
positive,21/4/21,"I bought this same brand at a local health food store.  For 1 oz. it cost $7.99.  So, when I bought this, at 4 oz. it made economic sense."
positive,2/5/21,"cats - if you are owned by a cat you know how fussy they can be.  My adopted feral cat just loves these treats.  I love spoiling her but they are so expensive at the grocery store.  Now, thansk to Amazon.com I can buy them in multiples. The price is cheaper, and what can I say about the convenience of having them shipped to the door!"
negative,18/12/19,"How do you expect me to buy yhis product for this price?<br />Keurig sells the same item for only $10.75, less than half the asking price here...."

positive,19/1/20,I work from home and drink aobut 5-6 cups off K-Cup coffee a day. This is good tasting coffee and the lowest price K-Cup on the market!
positive,31/3/20,"Have been getting this coffee for several months and very much like their bold flavor in comparison to others I've tried. Keep it air tight after opening is not a big deal. great coffee!"
positive,18/12/19,This is my new favorite coffee!  And the price is a great value too.  I first tried this coffee from a local grocery store and was thrilled that I can purchase it through Amazon in 80 ct package at a great price.
positive,13/10/19,I am so glad I read the reviews on this coffee product.  The cups fit the Keurig very well and make a tasty cup of coffee!  I like the fact that there is no plastic base to it (less plastic in the trash).  I will buy it again and again.  My favorite coffee thus far.  I have subscribed to this so it will be shipped automatically every month.
positive,28/9/20,love these little crackers and a great price on these will be ordering from this vendor again expiration on these was bout 6 months away
positive,16/11/20,"I had never purchased Beef Jerky or Beef Sticks through an on line vendor, prior to placing an order with Choo Choo R. Snacks. The products arrived on time and in good shape.  They were great. The peperoni sticks lasted about 4 days.  The big bag of jerky, about 6.  I had heard several customers complain about the jerky being tough.  When I was growing up, some 50 yearsw ago, jerked meat WAS TOUGH, chewy, but tough.  Bufflo Bills' Hickory smoked jerky was delicious.  They sent along a packof Teriaki (SP), flavored jerky.  Wow, that was soooo good!  I have placed another order with Choo Choo R Snacks.  I will buy all my Jerky, Beef Sticks, etc from Choo Choo.  They do these products right!"
positive,27/2/20,"This tea is overpriced. At asian markets, retail is $6.95. Certainly, wholesale is drastically less. The price asked for here is appalling. It's the exact same tea and Foojoy is considered one of the lesser brands in teas. The product is great, the seller? Doubtful."
positive,26/2/21,"Great product, but I pay 75 cents per pouch at our local grocery store.  Here they are selling for over 2 dollars a pouch.  I was hoping to put a few cases on monthly shipment but given the price I will keep buying them at the grocery store!"
positive,18/12/19,"We need to buy these for one of our children who has special needs and the price on Amazon can't be beat."
positive,19/1/20,"I've been eating carnation instant breakfast for a few years now and this is about as a good a price as I've found (I've found it cheaper when on sale at a local store but those sales are rare). I use two cups of milk instead of the instructed one, so the flavor is diluted a bit, but still good."
negative,13/9/20,I personally think the price is high. I can get it a lot cheaper elsewhere so that is what I will do.
positive,10/7/20,"This product is great for people on who eat plant-based, whole foods.  There is no sugar added.  The product tastes delicious.  The price, however, is quite expensive for the size of the jar.  I found a similar product at a local whole-foods grocery store for half the price."
positive,14/4/21,"I'm not generally a huge fan of Keurig coffee makers because they and their K-cups are so expensive. But my girlfriend has one and she ran out of coffee for it. I looked around Amazon and found this item. It sounded promising so I decided to try it. It is the best K-cup of coffee I've ever had (it has a strong, mellow medium roast flavor). And it's also the least expensive I've found. I signed up for a subscription and will probably keep it going. Yum."
positive,24/4/21,Iam a shopper for QUALITY for less.  This coffee is a EXCELLANT value as it has a great coffee taste. I hope this company comes out with some flavored coffees for my afternoon treat.
positive,28/4/21,"Like many of the other reviewers, I've tried all of the premium dog foods out there. When our family hit some tough financial times, I began looking for a good food that would be a better fit with our budget. This food absolutely fits the bill.  My golden retriever mix is not crazy about it, but that doesn't bother me that much--he's a good weight, and he will eat it when he's hungry.  He's had some allergy issues in the past and I was sure this food would kick them into gear, but it didn't--after fully transitioning to this food he has not gotten itchy at all.  I'm definitely going to stick with Chicken Soup... why pay twice as much on dog food if you don't have to?"
positive,12/7/21,"I was buying these at the pet store for $20 EACH, with this deal you get two for that price.  I ordered the largest size possible because I know my corgis like to chew the heck out of these.  They love these.  I've discovered they prefer the flat ones to the rounded type.  One that was sent in this deal was just a little curved, which makes it harder for their stumpy legs to hold while chewing, so they ""argue"" over who gets the un-bent one!  If I hold the crooked one then they will chew it but they definitely like the flatter one best!  A very good value if your dogs are chewers!!!"
positive,18/12/19,"Much cheaper than buying it in stores and my dog loved it. He would spend maybe 15-20 mins on the granola outer layer and then unwrap the rawhide to eat the middle. My dog doesn't eat rawhide really and always did this with dingo bones too. Will keep my dog busy for 40 mins or so and he seems to enjoy it so I will probably get this again."
positive,19/1/20,This is a good price and my very picky son eats this. Tt was delivered on time and i used the amazon subscription to get the price a little lower.
negative,28/4/21,"This is just and FYI for you guys, you ca buy this exact same box, of these exact same noodles at a korean market for around 16$'s. You can get them for .80-.99$'s (most placed will still cut you a bulk deal for around 18$ a box) from any grocery store with an Asian section (I'm sure they're 5$'s a piece in California, NY or ""wherever"" so chill out ninnies). Don't get ripped off for these if you've got any of the aforementioned within easy access."
positive,8/8/20,"What can I say....It's ground flax seed.  The five stars are for the price.  I used to buy the stuff at Walmart who sold it in their baking goods section in a box at a very reasonable price.  The last time I looked for it the sales lady says ""Oh, we moved it to pharmacy section.""  They sure did move it, along with repackaging and bumping the price about 4 times as much.  Amazon has a great price but the only drawback is that a 6 pack of 40oz jars is a lot of flax seed."
positive,22/5/21,"My daughter loves the food, and I like it even better because it's organic and Amazon has the best price."
positive,18/12/19,I use this olive oil daily.  This was a great price and the free shipping made it even better.
negative,19/1/20,"This product is very good, but what with the $79.00 price plus paying for shipping.  I was ordering this product for $30.00 for a pack of 12 boxes and shipping was free  I was told a few months ago the cookies would no longer be made.<br />I get an e-mail that they are in stock again, well that's nice but not at the $79.00 price I can get them a lot less expensive at my local grocery store."
positive,3/8/20,"Torani Syrup, Sugar-Free Vanilla, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3) Best price anywhere. I use for coffee, cereal and yogurt. Very good!"
positive,29/7/21,"Chex Wheat Cereal is a product that's been around for a long time, and it's never needed ""improvement."" It's just about perfect as-is. It stays crispy, has a marvelous flavor, and it's even great right out of the box.<br />Of course, it's also an essential part of Chex party mix -- always a favorite.<br /><br />Having it delivered by Amazon at a cheaper price than a local supermarket was a nice surprise!"
positive,8/7/20,Good price for 3 bottles of syrup.  the bottle is plastic not glass though.
positive,13/4/21,"My oldest son likes this coffee and its price and suggested I use it for guests at our rental vacation property. I do use the coffee and have never had a complaint from any of our guests. I generally buy the original ground or decaff original and am pleased with both. By using 'Subscribe and Save' this coffee is cheaper than any local store, including using a Eight O'Clock coupon at either Walmart or Target."
positive,20/2/21,"I found this product and price the best. I know this is an instant coffee, but it has great taste. You can't beat Amazon price or service any where."
positive,9/12/20,I drink a gallon a day.  This is better than regular sugar kool aid and so much cheaper on amazon.  I order regularly
positive,1/4/21,Product was just as promised. I would purchase it again. They are good. They are great. I sugest them. That is all I can write about this product.
positive,25/2/21,"Our favorite coffee, and what a great price..However, the delivery we set up cannot be relied on.  some months it arrives as planned, some months it does not show up, then we get a msg saying out of product...then it comes the next month....hoping they resolve the availability soon"
positive,18/12/19,I always like Starbucks VIA Ready Brew Coffee. This is the lowest price I got. I might continue purchasing this product from Amozon.com.
negative,19/1/20,At the Hodgson Mill website they are seling a case of 6 for the same price.  talk about rip-offs.
positive,14/10/20,"I can't believe I paid here over $11..big mistake<br />on my part should checked local first...<br />just paid under $ 3.00 for 16 oz at our local Publix<br /><br />rated a 5 * for the item..."
positive,10/3/21,"Love this seasoning. Delicious for my steak.<br />Couldn't find this where I live, so I was really happy to find it on Amazon.<br />Great price!"
positive,15/8/21,Have been using this for years on steak for the BBQ w/ a bit of olive oil----this price is great!!!
positive,27/4/21,"had to order these tea bags because I came fron NJ and down south they are not sold,can,t go wrong with the price"
positive,24/1/21,"My kids love them, and is affordable and convenient, delivered to my home, and the peace of mind that I am feeding them organic... A HIT!!"
positive,14/7/20,"I have to say this is the best deal for milk bones on amazon, and of course, my dog go crazy just looking at the unboxed milk-bone."
negative,5/6/21,"Just canceled my order.  Found the same product at Target for $2.99 with an instant coupon, got it for $2.50."
positive,9/7/21,"Everything arrived as it should and we're very happy! Our department can't wait for the next shipment, so I'll be ordering quite frequently."
negative,5/6/21,"I used to order this item regularly. Six jars was $14. However, it's now more than $24. That comes out to more than the single jar price in the supermarkets. I emailed to ask them if this was the correct price. They never responded. No reason to order it in bulk anymore online."
positive,25/7/21,"I have been very happy with the Grove Square K-Cup products.  I really like the creamy Cappuccino French Vanilla flavor.  The French Vanilla is great when you want a coffee that's creamy with a light flavor.  Great Price, cost less then other K-Cups which is also a great selling point!  I also like Grove Square Dark Chocolate Hot Cocoa, Grove Square Caramel Apple Cider, and think the Grove Square Medium Roast is okay (it is an instant coffee, so it's lighter in flavor but still good)."
positive,13/7/21,"My cat is used to eating Weruva and Tiki Cat, so I wasn't sure how he would take to this brand. This doesn't look at all like the previous two brands (which actually look like people food) whereas BFF brand looks like typical cat food. Lou isn't normally picky, but he doesn't eat this food quite as quickly as Tiki or Weruva. I bought two cases of 10 (Tuna & Bonito and Tuna & Shrimp) and while it's a good price, I think next time we'll stick to Weruva for big cans of food and Tiki for small cans (he gets one big can in the am and one small can in the pm!) I'd buy this stuff again in the future if I was in a pinch, as it's not a bad food...I just like my cats food to look more like real fish or chicken vs over processed ""stuff"". But good ingredients and grain free at a good price!"
positive,9/7/21,uhhh you can get one of these 10 ounce jars at the grocery store for 1.62  wtf.... The sauce is indeed the best  but 15 bucks really
negative,8/7/21,This is ridiculous - I shop Amazon all the time and I am definitely pro-Amazon but the price on the package of Thomas English Muffins is insane - $6.95 for one package of 6.  You can purchase a pack at Walmart for $2.  Who would pay this price?<br /><br />Amazon you get it right 99% of the time and are spot on but maybe not on your food prices.  This is the first time I have checked prices on food.  Today Show just did a segment and I had to check it out - and sure enough your muffins are $6.95.
positive,15/7/21,"These do taste better than the cheap brands like Maruchuan, and you get a slightly larger (3.5oz block), but these are WAY more expensive.  I've seen them in local Wal-Marts for a slightly lower price.  Overall they do have a good flavor, not too salty or mushy."
negative,6/7/21,"I was expecting (or hoping) for a different variet of tazo, since I love the Awake and the Zen so much.  What I received was a brown paper bag with 5 Awake and 5 Zen and 1 small tea bag of peppermint.  The reason I gave it 1 star is that I love TAZO K-cups, but not for that price.  I could have 2.5 times the amount for that price."
positive,13/8/21,This candy can be purchased anywhere fom $2.00 a box to .65 cents a box. I ordered 3 cases of it at .97 cents a box and I thought I got a fair deal.
negative,5/6/21,Somehow I thought for the price - I was getting a case - not one little bag.  Should have ordered the case I found elsewhere.
positive,9/7/21,"It's very expensive but now Tesco stock it  ( Cheap )but it's sometimes easier to buy here if you don't have a store nearby.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NY3A8C"">Knorr All Purpose Aromat Seasoning 3oz./85g</a>"
positive,17/6/21,"This is my wife's brand of choice for decent, not too expensive espresso.  It's hard to find in stores around here, so buying on Amazon is a really nice option, especially with Prime."
positive,31/8/21,Good Cuban style espresso.I received a damaged product (3 of 4 packs had lost vacuum)and amazon quickly refunded me.
positive,7/8/21,"I purchased 5 boxes of these. I really enjoy the taste and nutritional value of the bars. Great starter, mid day pick me up or evening snack (dip into milk). These are crunchy. Great price & excellent Amazon service!"
positive,6/9/21,I want to say this coffee is very good .Have had no issues with bad pods .Check your machine if you are having issues with pod breaking open .Sometimes the  needle get clongged or worn and you will start having this issue.I love the price of this coffee.Great taste you will see the price of kerig pods come down soon the patent has expired
positive,5/6/21,"I am really enjoying this coffee. It tastes excellent, was nicely priced and the company has gone out of their way to provide excellent customer service after some initial problems.<br /><br />I am going to get this monthly on subscribe and save and I do recommend it now. the brooklyn bridge and breakfast blend are very nice!"
positive,9/7/21,"I used to buy CET's from the vet, but these are almost half the price & ship free with Prime. Can't beat that."
positive,19/6/21,"A great product at a great price.  These little slim jim snacks taste much better than the full version sold in convenience stores.  Not sure why, but they do.  Others have written the same thing.  Very convenient box and easy to store.  Makes a great adder for school lunches and etc, or just a quick snack on the run."
positive,5/9/21,My order was hassle free and processed swiftly. The packaging was well done and the delivery was right on the money. Definintly recommend buying your Slim Jims here!
negative,10/10/21,"You can buy this bread directly from Udi's for a lot cheaper. The Bread is great but not at this price."
positive,29/9/21,Very delicious coffee and a special bargain when purchased from Amazon.  I love the easy open boxes and will always purchase my t-discs from Amazon.
positive,11/9/21,Great product for the price.  They stayed fresh for a while and tasted very good!  I love that we can get the cheddar blast in a large container.
positive,5/6/21,"Love this product, and the price was great as long as I purchased enough to qualify for free shipping."
negative,9/7/21,"This item is highly overpriced!  After purchasing, I found this in the store for $3.98.  I won't be ordering from here again."
positive,26/8/21,Living in the city it is hard to find pectin at the local grocery so this is a great price and delivered right to my door!
positive,26/7/21,"OK, the package says that these are ESE pods, they look the same as other ESE pods, have the same shape and size as other ESE pods that I have around, and weigh the same as other ESE pods, as far as I can tell. These pods even brew for about as long other ESE pods using my Saeco Espresso Classico machine. I don't know whether it's the grind that Lavazza uses, but the Lavazza pods don't seem to be as tightly packed as other ESE pods, and the resulting espresso is slightly less strong than the espresso made by the other ESE pods. That being said, the espresso is perfectly acceptable, particularly when you take into account the price that you pay when you go on Amazon's subscription plan."
positive,11/9/21,"I ordered this when I found a few indian recipes that I wanted to try.  It would have been outrageous for me to buy all the spices individually but thankfully I found this.  All the spices come in separate baggies.  My only complaint is that when they arrived they were all jumbled up but there is a list that tells you where each one goes in the box and it was simple to follow,so it was no big deal."
positive,11/9/21,i was having problems finding good reasonably priced beans out of season...here they are!
positive,15/9/21,"I have tried a lot of hazelnut coffees and this is my favorite.  The K cups perform well unlike another brand whose name I won't mention (WP) and the flavor is much bolder than every other brand.  Green Mountain used to have a bold one but it was discontinued except in sample packs (with other flavors).  This coffee has a nice taste, too.  I just wish I could find it locally and for less money.  You used to be able to get a bundle of large boxes from Amazon but they're not currently available.  I think this was the best price I could get but was disappointed when I received my 3 tiny boxes - if you overlooked it these boxes only contain 12 K cups each.  I'll keep looking for better value but in the meantime I can still enjoy a good cup of coffee made at home.  I gave it only four stars because of the price but I do recommend this coffee."
positive,5/6/21,"My wife is a tea lover.  She finds Stash Premium White Christmas Tea soothing & delightful.  I thought the price was great, too."
positive,9/7/21,I love this tea and can only find it at around the holidays.  What a great find I was able to order a large amount for a great price!
positive,14/9/21,"The price at amazon varies for this product, it is competitive unless it gets to almost 30 for 4.  Quality is good."
positive,29/9/21,"I love Nescafe Taster's Choice coffee.  I had been using the Gourmet Roast, but when my blood pressure became slightly elevated, I switched to the Decaf.  It is delicious, and my blood pressure is now behaving.  I love being able to buy this product for such a fair price."
positive,10/7/21,"I used to use the other popular brand that cost 3 times more.  This brand is better at 1/3 the price.  This product has a very rich pink color.  From what I have read the source of the pink color is where the health benefits of Himalayan salt come from.  The deep pink color of this salt would indicate a very healthy product, and its tasty too!"
negative,1/3/20,"I wouldn't mind paying the price if the coffee was any good. The beans smell like burnt coffee, unlike any other French Roast I have picked up. This leads to a very bitter and burnt taste throughout. There is simply nothing special about this expensive coffee."
negative,28/7/20,90 percent of this candy and these brands are still sold in stores today!You could pay 30 dollars at the grocery store and probably get 4 times as much candy for the money.
positive,28/7/20,This is really good coffee and the price is right.  My husband enjoyed this coffee as well.
negative,10/11/19,"I have been buying this for years, it has always been two boxes of 50 pods each for the $59.98. Recently the price has doubled to one box of 50 pods for $59.98. Greed. I have been forced to shop for other brands and surprising I do like the other brands."
positive,1/3/20,"This is a great value on a great product. I use this daily, on my skin as a moisturizer and for cooking. Can't beat the quality or the price!"
positive,3/8/19,"I have gotten this product in smaller jars before and was very pleased so to save money I ordered the gallon tub. The coconut oil in the tub seems to have less flavor than the jars or maybe it was that particular batch. I'll know better after I try the next 1 gallon tub. I will order this product again.<br /><br />May 2011, I am half way thru my second gallon of this product and the taste is very good.<br />My only wish now is that it was cold pressed/unheated."
negative,6/2/21,"I am looking at a can of NIDO (12.6 ounces; 360 grams) for which I paid $3.54 plus sales tax yesterday at WalMart.<br />The one-star rating is for your creative pricing; not the product. I'd give the product 5 stars."
positive,24/2/21,"Like the previous reviewer, I have found the price when using Subscribe and Save to be better than any that I can find anywhere else. These are quality pumpkin seeds. Hopefully they will be good for my prostate. Excellent in cereal or in a smoothie. Recommended."
negative,13/5/21,you can buy same pack from grocery store for $6:50. anyone who would buy this for that expensive price will be stupid.
positive,1/3/20,I agree that this is agreat product.But I got it at King Arthur flour co.for $5.99 per pound.
positive,28/7/20,"I order this tea every couple of months from Amazon for the great price and it's the best powered Arizona tea.  The taste is great, my kids love it, no caffeine or sugar too.  It's also difficult to find this product in stores.  Highly recommend it!"
negative,13/5/20,"OMG, THIS WAS $19.00 FOR 3 BOXES AND I JUST BOUGHT IT FOR LESS THEN $2.00 A BOX, IF I WOULD HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE I BOUGHT IT AT WEIS MARKETS I WOULD HAVE NEVER PAID THIS PRICE. I THOUGHT IT WAS 3 CONTAINERS OF 3 BOXES FOR A TOTAL OF 9 BOXES. WHAT A DUMMY I WAS FOR BUYING THIS. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE"
positive,26/3/21,"Plants were very well packaged and all specimens are in excellent health and condition.  Arrived well before the estimated delivery date (in fact, took only over a day to get here).  Seller has great communication even emailing prior to shipment arriving with care instructions and when the product would arrive.  The seller also threw in a bottle of fertilizer at no extra charge.  Saved me alot of money over buying locally.  Can not express how happy I am with this experience.  Will definitely order again."
positive,29/8/19,"This is the best inexpensive coffee I've ever bought!  You can certainly compare it to higher end brands.  And when I subscribe I get it even cheaper. How can you go wrong?  Overall, I love this coffee!!!"
positive,7/2/21,This is great coffee at a fair price. Amazon has the best deals and super fast shipping.
positive,14/10/21,"This coffee doesn't necessarily have brand cachet, but it's as good as other coffee I've bought at 2x the price."
positive,7/8/20,very happy with this product price was great we liked it a lot we would recomend it to other people
positive,1/3/20,"This is the only rice cereal we use for my son. He has had bad acid reflux and of course needs cereal in every bottle so we go through a good bit. After comparing proces, this is the cheapest we have found. Though only pennies in difference, you cant beat the fact that it is free shipping and comes straight to your door."
positive,28/7/20,My mom drinks a cup or two of tea everyday and makes iced tea so we go through these pretty fast. Amazon has a great price!
positive,14/9/21,"This coffee looks like its a collection of beans which has been swept up off the floor afer a days roasting...WHICH IS NOT MEANT AS A CRITICISM...thats what I would expect poor mans blend to be...but seriously, its very consistently decent coffee...you can't beat it for the subscription price...i think I am on my 3rd bag (5#'s!) and am hooked. There are certainly better coffees but not for the ""Poor Man"" (me)."
positive,17/12/20,This product is WAY over priced.  I bought the same thing for $4.29 at my local Safeway and K-Mart.  My two dogs love them and I give them as a treat.
positive,2/5/20,"This was an awesome price for the amount of ounces, and it serves the purpose of the purchase. I would definitely recommend this to others seeking black walnut extract. Thanks!"
positive,14/7/21,"I have very long thick hair and have been coloring it for years, so no matter how often I get my hair trimmed most of it is dry and fairly fragile. Although the aroma of this product is a little lighter than the others products of this line that I have tried, it is still a little over-powering for my taste.  My hair scent clashes with my perfume.  I hate that and that is why I try always to purchase fragrance free products.<br /><br />But that issue aside- this product seems to do what it claims to do.<br /><br />I'm always looking for an inexpensive product that may be the equivalent of a salon product. Well I'm sorry there just aren't any, but this conditioner comes slightly closer than most.<br /><br />I did seem to see less hair in my comb as I was combing my hair out after my shower, my scalp seems to bee less dry  and my comb ran through my hair quite easily.<br /><br />After drying and using the heated flate iron on my hair it appeared silky, somewhat shiny and was quite  easy to manage."
positive,18/7/19,"i get these all the time and this seller has a good price, best on the web so far. and just the rite size too, not too big and there hard all the way through. iv had some the crumbled about 2/3 through."
positive,1/3/20,"I have a delicious recipe for pumpkin muffins that I make again and again, and I am tired of spending too much money on the little supermarket jars of pumpkin pie spice.  The quality and taste of this product is just as good, for a fraction of the cost."
negative,28/7/20,"These snacks are great but the price is beyond absurd.  These are $3 - $3.50 each in Wal-Mart.  Here it is $7 each.  Price gouging at it's best.  What a joke."
positive,13/6/20,"I've been using coconut oil in my morning coffee for 6 months and believe it has helped lessen chronic inflammation. Not only was it cheaper to buy in bulk, the smaller size is easier to store."
negative,10/3/20,"This product is Hackleback Sturgeon roe which is very good. The problem I have with the supplier is that it is over priced. One may<br />purchase this product from Marky's Caviar-- the exact same caviar from Markys for a little over 43 dollars for 2 oz not 64 dollars for 1 oz.<br />The shipping for this product is also outrageous. If you like this product which I did get the most for your money from Marky's Caviar and<br />forget Charleston Seafood. I had even called Charleston and they were not able to  help me when confronted with the facts so poor<br />customer service."
positive,9/5/20,I love this soup. Very hard to find in Florida. Thank You Amazon for stocking it
negative,14/5/19,"Soooooooo tired of being charged super-outrageous prices for products that are gluten-free.  Before you purchase this, please realize that you are paying $17.05 a pound."
negative,19/10/20,"OMG!THIS IS A RIP-OFF!I LIVE IN TEXAS WHERE YOU CAN BUY A 12-PACK OF FAYGO FOR UNDER 4 BUCKS.  THIS IS REALLY GOOD SODA. THE PRODUCT ITSELF, IS GREAT BUT WAY 2 OVERPRICED. I AM DISAPPOINTED."
positive,1/3/20,"My son (age 5) has food allergies (wheat, soy, dairy, peanut).  So he knows when he sees ""Enjoy Life"" on the package, he can actually have it!  And it's great for him to have options w/ different flavor cookies.  It makes it easier for me when I have to pack his lunch for school to give him something different each day.  The only thing I would love to have on the subscribe and save program is the ability to mix and match products.  But the product itself is great.  My son says they have a little bit of a bite to them, but that is how ginger cookies are.  He compares these to the Pamela's ginger snaps.  He likes both.  But sometimes he likes to have the ""soft"" ginger cookies...which is the Enjoy Life type."
positive,28/7/20,The title says it all.  This is a great oil and the price is right.  My shipment came promptly.  Avocado oil is great for cooking and has many health benefits.
positive,7/3/20,I was very happy with this product.  Coconut oil in mac and cheese gives it a little hint of tropical taste without overwhelming the dish. I ordered this in February (the cooler part of the year) and it arrived in perfect condition.  Some others have written that they were not happy because it apparently leaked all over the place.  This is probably due to the product becoming liquid at 76 degrees.  My oil was solid when it arrived and did not have this problem.  I hope Amazon can resolve this issue quickly.
positive,4/8/20,"I am new to coconut oil....the cost is what kept me from trying it sooner.  This is the best deal I've ever run across and the product is excellent!"
positive,26/12/19,"I buy all of my pets food on Amazon.  The prices are great and with the free shipping over $25.00 it's a win win deal!"
positive,28/3/21,"I was at Wal Mart today and compared pricing.  $1.83 a box for 12.2 oz.  It was around $2.80 at Wal-Mart for 18 oz in their store brand.  So the real deal is slightly cheaper and shows right up at the door.  Can't beat it.  I wish the prices were as good on other cereal on Amazon.<br /><br />As a bonus, these boxes came with a Spider-Man movie ticket promotion.  So I ordered more to get free tickets for my family via the promotion.  Consider that, the cereal was almost free."
positive,6/2/20,"I bought two jars of this cayenne pepper for my grandpa, who uses cayenne pepper to make a squirrel-repellant blend of bird seed.  Works just as well as the overpriced retail brands from the supermarket.  This is the best price for bulk cayenne pepper I've seen, and it shipped exceptionally quickly."
positive,25/4/21,"My children love this cereal. The price is great (I can't do much better with a coupon and Sam's can't touch it). The cereal arrives fresh and in great condition. It's awesome that I don't have to run to the store with all four kids in tow when we start to run low! Thanks Amazon!"
positive,3/8/20,"Since moving towards a more natural lifestyle, I have found cashews to be in quite a few recipes, so I was so happy when I saw this great deal!"
negative,15/4/19,"I should've done my research first. Basically over a $1 per jar. I can get a WAY better deal by going to the store. Total ripoff!<br /><br />I will continue to buy Beech Nut, just not from this person."
positive,9/3/18,"Gloria Jean's Coffee is delicious. Hazelnut is my favorite flavor. It is convenient that this coffee comes in boxes of 50 so I do not have to stock up on k-cups very often and the price is very good."
positive,18/5/18,"We love the Hazelnut coffee in our house! Great flavor and the coffee isn't bitter or too strong. I also love the price! Buying it here in a pack of 50 makes it cheaper than any of the stores in our city."
positive,9/3/18,"Uncle purchase K-Cup Keurig brewer for my office.  My staff and I love it.  No arguments about who is going to clean up the coffee at the end of the day.  Who is to blame for not turning it off and coffee burning at the bottom of the jug.  Plus we can have a selection of different coffees to suite the tastes for anyone.  We love it.  The Gloria Jean's Hazelnut is a very flavorful, but not a strong coffee.  I prefer the ""Jet-Fuel"" brand, but for the tamer coffee drinkers in the office they swear by it."
negative,27/2/18,"Very Very overpriced. 30 Starbucks K-Cup for $49.44? You can get from BJS, Sams Club or Costco a 54 count Starbucks K-Cup for $39.99. Which is a way better deal."
positive,20/2/18,Great product and the pricing on Amazon is pretty much impossible to beat.  You get about 3 bottles on amazon for the price of one at most places.<br /><br />I use this syrup mostly for Lattes
positive,22/3/18,"These are the only rose hips I've had in my life, so I don't have any standard of comparison.<br /><br />Tastes good to me, though.  I became interested in these because of joint/gum problems and hearing that vitamin C could help with that.  I figured that bioflavonoids/other compounds may be important for absorbing vitamin C and I'd probably be better off getting it from a whole food than from a supplement (not that there's anything wrong with supplements - just my way of thinking!).<br /><br />Anyway: I mostly use these for making 'soaked tea.'  Or just iced tea?  :D  Basically I just put a good amount of these in a bottle filled with a couple cups of water (around 3-4 tablespoons), shake it up, stick that in the refrigerator, then shake it up really well the next day when the rose hips are softened.  That's when the water takes on a rich orange/light amber color and noticeably thickens up (maybe from the pectin that I'm assuming is in the rose hips?), and also tastes great.  Shaking it really well helps to disperse all the flavor - keep that in mind.<br /><br />I eat the rose hips too (after soaking overnight) and they taste good as well, but a little strong eating a lot of them.<br /><br />I've made tea with them, and I enjoy that a lot, but I thought that heating it up so much would destroy a lot of the vitamin C.  If you're drinking it for enjoyment, it doesn't really matter what you do, and the rose hip tea I made with these rose hips tasted great.  You have to use a good amount of rose hips to get that tangy/sour flavor; for making 1 cup I'd at least use a couple tablespoons, but that's just me - everyone has their preferences.<br /><br />Overall I think it's very pleasant and refreshing, though I prefer it unheated, and just ""soaked and shaken.""  I make kefir and adding these to the 'ripening under airlock' phase can make an interesting brew.  There's a lot you can do with these things, so don't be afraid to get creative.<br /><br />As for this specific brand, as I said, it's the only one I've tried, so I don't have a standard of comparison -- but I'm satisfied with these, think they taste fine, and they were sold for a great price.  No complaints here :)"
positive,12/3/18,"I am so happy I finally found these on here. To the person who gave a 1 star because they are 10$- you may be able to go in a store and pay 2.59 a box. If your like the rest of us who are from NY, NJ, etc and moved to the west coast- you cant find these anywhere. I usually stock up on these when i go back to NY but its nice to know I can order them whenever I want!"
positive,9/2/18,I love the Peter Pan brand and I am pleased with the price.  Time to stock up so I did.
positive,7/12/17,"It's so hard to find no sodium seasonings (other than Mrs. Dash) - this is a great product at a great price!"
positive,24/5/19,"I was a little surprised by the problems experienced by Soulwriterchick per her review. Four adult cats in our house, two with sensitive gut or skin, have been eating this stuff for two months. They like it (after several tentative days) as well as the similar-quality (but too expensive) ""Halo Spot's Stew Natural Dry Cat Food."" Their preference for this food is the same as their preference for the much cheaper (by the 20-lb bag) Iams Adult Active Maturity. Natural Balance has better ingredients, though. Comparing these 3 products with Science Diet: They like the new Science Diet Age Defying Senior Dry Cat Food best by flavor (costs almost as much as Halo) BUT the Science Diet foods have ingredients no better in quality than the far cheaper IAMS and the cats, all of them, eat far too much of the Science Diet (or act like they're starving), making it the least economical of the bunch. It's clear the ""scientists"" at Science Diet have developed some kind of kittie-cocaine. grrr.<br /><br />update:  after another month of use, I find the gang, after getting used to the non-standard taste, have migrated to this dry food and have not been eating as much of the IAMS or a sensitive-cat Purina product. They also like the Halo product a lot now.<br /><br />5-month Update:  A recent emotional blow for the cats, losing their older brother, seems to have made them very fussy about food. I had also made the mistake of giving them some canned food a few months back--a BIG mistake. Anyhow, at present, they are refusing to eat this Natural Balance Dry food. It is good stuff. I just have to figure out how to get them back on track."
positive,9/3/18,"It came pretty quick, was at an unbeatable price, and was the same good hot cereal I get from the store (no damage or anything); Not much else to say."
positive,18/5/18,"I have been a loyal Coffee Bean Direct Customer for a couple years now. We mostly prefer the Dark Sumatra, but have tried a few others as well. We find the Dark Sumatra to be the boldest, while very low in acid. This means you can make it as strong as you like without the upset stomach. Highly recommend both the Dark Sumatra and the seller."
positive,23/3/18,I order this tuna for my daugter who is in Afganastan every few months.  She loves it!!  They are limited what is available to eat and this usually makes her day.
positive,8/9/20,"we really prefer the scented bags to the unscented, but they cost so much more at the pet stores.  we were so happy to find them here for such a great price :)"
positive,23/2/18,The price was great as we saved quite a bit of money compared to retail outlets.  The delivery was prompt and we were lucky to get it under a free shipping promotion.  The product itself is one of the best scone mixes that we have tried.
positive,18/7/20,"I have used this product for many years. Love the flavor.But buy it at Kroger's, it is one third the cost.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DU2AK4"">Mexene Original Chili Powder Seasoning - 2 oz</a> It is a 3 oz jar."
negative,14/6/18,"The sole reason I purchased the Tassimo machine was because I love Starbucks coffee. I think it is disgraceful the prices that are being charged for the T-discs for Starbucks coffee since Starbucks discontinued their relationship with Tassimo. On average, it is close to $8 a t-disc. Something is very wrong with this picture."
positive,2/11/18,"This is a great price, and to have it have it delivered by weekly can't go wrong, and the coffee is good"
positive,14/10/18,Pricey but good - OK sixteen more words to say the same thing Pricey but good - four more words
positive,6/4/20,Shame on you! These are great mixers and the 5-packs are on sale at Target for just under 8 bucks each!
negative,9/3/18,These are MUCH cheaper at walmart... 2.50 a canister. You are basically paying double. You would think it woudl be cheaper on amazon then at walmart. WAY over priced!
positive,18/5/18,"This ""Brachs Assorted Halloween Melocream Candy<br />is available at Big M Stores for $1.19 per 11oz bag!<br />I get them every year as a tradition.<br />they have Chocolet Bats, Maple Jugs & Corn Stalks, Banana Half Moons & Corn Ears as well as traditional Candy Corn flavored Pumpkins."
positive,7/3/18,"This is a good product but I can't believe such a high price usally Amazon is close on prices but you can buy these at Sam's club for $7.68."
positive,24/1/19,"This formula has been THE BEST for our baby. He has not had one problem with this formula. The price you cannot beat, usually one can is $29, with Subscribe & Save it comes out to about $21/can."
positive,27/2/19,Great value for an Organic Infant formula. We have the subscription model which gets the price lower. Comparable canisters cost at least $28 a canister. Our baby loved the product from day one.
positive,19/4/20,"I ordered 8 cans of Earth's Best Organic formula and I got them in time as scheduled. We have been using it since my daughter was 2 weeks old. She is 10 month old now and she loves it. It is cheaper to order it online then buy it from babiesrus."
positive,17/4/20,"I was first introduced to these little gems at Sam's Club, but they no longer carry them, so I turned to Amazon and found a  great price on a product I hope to keep using for years.  It is the first (and only) individual serving drink mix diet tea I have found that is sweetened with Splenda - I don't do aspartame.  Delicious, too!"
positive,3/4/20,Good Product for a good price.  Would order again and probably when our pup gets to be an adult we we order the adult food.
positive,7/8/19,What else is there to say? A great strong flavored coffee at a great price.
negative,9/3/18,This coffe was over priced and not a true French roast. I would not describe it as dark or bold in flavor.  Would have been helpful if a price per pod was added.
positive,18/5/18,"First off, I love these Torani sugar free syrups, it's a great no calorie way to sweeten and add flavor to your coffee.  I purchased my first bottle locally in a gourmet shop, for about $13.  Buying the three pack on amazon is like getting a bottle for free.  FYI, bottles from amazon are plastic, which I don't mind at all - less likely I'll break them while stumbling through my morning routine.  :)<br /><br />Great price, fast delivery."
negative,27/1/19,"You can order the same products online from Nespresso for approx $25.<br /><br />Nespresso makes GREAT machines and GREAT coffee pods. These pod offers on Amazon however are mostly from third party vendors. They prey on people who don't know better, charging you 2x the price of ordering the pods directly from Nespresso. I have been ordering through Nespresso's website for a couple of years now and their shipping times are always fast and reliable. I buy many things through Amazon, but not Nespresso pods."
positive,10/11/19,Great priced 12 (total 48 envelopes) pack box. Almost half of what we pay in the stores. Excellent for traveling.
positive,8/11/19,I sent this case of soup to my son. Great deal and I know he has food for now
positive,25/10/21,"This is a good product for sugar free gum. Not long after purchasing and using this gum, I found Spry gum in the same packaging with the same ingredients for less at the Vitamin Shoppe."
positive,8/5/20,"I have this on autoship.  Maple syrup is sooo expensive in the grocery store and you only get a small bottle.  I have a family of 5!  I love the autoship and you can't beat the price! Tastes great too!"
positive,28/9/18,"These are and will always be delicious! they are hard to find and was pleased to find it on amazon at a great price! best price found anywhere. my kids love the chocolate but the vanilla were even a better deal and of course also delicious! give it a try, you won't regret it!"
positive,29/7/19,"This is my favorite tea for the Keurig.  I love it, and this was the best price I could find!!!"
negative,9/3/18,"I didn't look closely enough at the price.  I thought sold in 10 packs meant 10 packages.  When I received 10 little marshmallows for $10 + $4.95 shipping and handling I was floored.  I have made homemade marshmallows and the contents don't cost very much."
negative,18/5/18,"I only received one box of seven packs of snack packs for $14.99.  Usually I receive 6 boxes of seven packs for this price so 42 total packs, not 7.  I should have been more wary."
positive,17/5/20,"For just about $10, this canister gives you about 150-180 cups of coffee. That is just over a nickel a cup- you can't beat that! That means that for the same money as ""premium"" coffees like Starbucks or Seattle's Best, you can get 80 cups (assuming $4 a cup). If you took $4 a day for 5 days a week, for a year, you would be spending $1000 just on coffee alone, money you can save for a car or down payment.  Even if the Starbucks tastes a little better, is it really worth it?  This coffee does not taste as good as premium, but it does not taste bad either. So coffee afficionados would not be as let down as they think (and honestly that Starbucks Via stuff is way too expensive at $1 a cup).<br /><br />Granted, instant is not as good as a really fresh cup of freshly ground coffee, but it tastes better than most coffee, because most coffee is not freshly ground (especially the pre-ground coffee in bricks or cans).  Because freeze dried retains freshness a longer time if it is kept air-sealed, you get a fresh cup almost every time.<br /><br />There are only two big downsides to the 7 ounce containers.<br /><br />1. First, by the time you get to the bottom of the canister, you might experience some staleness. This is because of exposure to air, which affects even freeze-dried coffee. One possible solution is to seal small batches and keep them away from light and heat.<br /><br />2. It is easy to add too much instant coffee to a cup. It only takes a teaspoon to a teaspoon and a half for one cup, nothing more.  It only takes a little to make a cup.<br /><br />Overall, Nescafe Taster's Choice offers a great balance between cost savings and taste. Is it as good as fresh brewed? Perhaps not, especially if you can get freshly ground coffee that you make yourself.  But it is certainly better than most coffee you get at, say, a diner or restaurant.  Cafes make it better, but at $4+ a cup, they are not worth it unless just as an occasional indulgence.<br /><br />If you are one of those people who has always scoffed at instant, I'd say at least give this a try."
positive,26/3/20,"We recently switched to formula and I have been looking all over for the cheapest price on our preferred formula. This was the cheapest price that I found anywhere, including the manufacturer and local big box stores. My package came in the advertised packaging, unlike some other reviews. I was very happy with the price, the product, and the value."
negative,24/2/20,This bag is extremely over priced. I can buy this at Winco for 99 cents when it is on sale. Just wanted my fellow amazonians to get the best price.
positive,3/5/19,"This is the best priced coconut flour I could find!<br />My recipes don't call for a whole lot of it at a time,<br />so I hope it stays fresh for a while. I did have a<br />problem with the recloseable zip lock bag, it doesn't<br />work so I have to roll it down and close it with<br />a closepin.  I hope the other 5 bags are better!"
negative,27/3/20,I get it from my grocery store for $1.50 a box and 3 boxes will be $4.50. I love the flavor. This is ridiculously over-priced.
positive,31/12/20,I have bought this at a local pet shop for my koi. The fish do well on this product and I just found it is also sold through Amazon for about 30% less.
positive,13/1/20,I have purchased these a couple times for my two dogs.  Great price (even with the expensive shipping charge) and long lasting.  There is nothing worse than paying $8 for a dog chew and then watching your dog eat it in less than 5 minutes!
positive,21/9/20,Using Keurig cups is so great but also expensive.  It is a luxury I will have to give up after retirement but the ease of trying so many different coffees is really great and I have enjoyed the coffee and the makers immensely.
positive,2/12/20,"I've been ordering dried cherries by mail for several years now, from another source. These cherries are just as good as my previous source, at a better price, thanks to Amazon Prime."
positive,20/11/19,"You can by at Kroger at half the price. Used to be cheaper before recent price hike, just continued from innertia to order until payed attention, people be careful!"
negative,2/12/20,Over priced for what you can get from the manufacturer directly and also have a much larger selection of different coffees - as well as the new chocolate flavor - do not understand why anyone would buy USED coffee - by its nature coffee cannot be USED
positive,11/12/19,"Cliff Bars stopped making my FAVORITE foodbar - Organic Nectar Cocoa & Walnut.  Dates was one of the main ingredients.  I have multiple food allergies and this was one of the only foodbars I liked and was ok for me.  I wrote to Cliff expressing my sadness about discontinued item and was even more disappointed to not receive any response.  So, thanks to the internet and bloggers, I was able to come up with a receipe to make my own Cliff Bar knock offs :)  Thank you!!  I have bought these dates several times and have always been pleased.  Hope Amazon.com continues to carry!"
positive,20/11/19,"I purchased this via Amazon, because I am NEVER sure I will be able to find it locally, and not have it cost an arm a leg and firstborn male child.  You cant beat the price, and the knowledge I will not have to comb the grocery stores looking made it a win win!  Not only that but each container I received had a 50 cent coupon attached, so if I DO find it locally I can enjoy a great discount!"
positive,28/6/20,"I haven't recieved the noodles yet, but I'm very impressed with the price! With my sights set on making a soba dish, I headed to the grocery store to find that an eight-ounce package of Soba noodles was selling for $7. And my recipe called for twelve ounces! I just could not see paying $14 for a simple noodle dish. As an experiment, I bought one package of soba noodles, and one $3 package of Udon to see if the soba noodles were really necessary. The soba noodles were significantly better for this dish, so I was resigned to have to pay so much for my yummy dish.<br /><br />Then I came here to and found that I can get a larger package of noodles for a little over $3 per package (after shipping)! I was very pleased. I hope they taste good! I'll be back for more, as I think I'm becoming addicted to Soba noodles!"
negative,8/8/20,Guess for all those desparate Germans living in the states - get it in Germany @ less than one $
negative,14/7/21,"This is a great product and my daughter loves them. She's been eating them since she was 9 months old. However, this is extremely overpriced. They're $2 a pack at Publix. $6.24 a pack is nuts."
positive,2/12/20,"These are really good, but its a stretch to pay that much for them.  I would buy them more often if the price was lower.  Energ brand is more resonably priced."
positive,20/11/19,"Love these, but $6.65 per package????  That's crazy when they went for $2.50-3.50 in the stores (Meijer, Walmart, Kroger).  Nice flavor and my favorite but no way would pay this much for what is essentially sugarfree koolaid."
positive,1/3/21,"I am a Dolce Gusto user for a long time, and this was the best price I could find for this product. So, I would recommend that due to that."
positive,5/5/21,Cremora is a fine product but very hard to find. It is available online but at ridiculous prices.Would be pleased to find an alternate source.
negative,2/12/20,"I am very dissapointed in Amazon on this one. Anything that I buy on a consistent basis I buy through Amazon, whether it is electronics, books, toys, diapers, etc., Amazon always comes through with an unbelievable deal. On this product they have missed the boat badly. I can understand 10% higher than the store, I can live with that. I'll buy in bulk through Amazon just for convienence. However, this product can be purchased an any Target or major grocery chain (mine at least - Kroger) for $3.89 or 4.29. If I were to buy 6 of these 32oz concetrates at Target with tax it would run me close to $26. This is 33% less than the sale price that Amazon is offering. This is the same concentrate used by starbucks, this is why I use it, to save money by making it on my own. Unfortunately with the price point I would be better off having someone make it for me."
positive,20/11/19,"I like this coffee! For me, finding this on Amazon was a true buy as I had this while in New Orleans. For the price, for the taste, and it is a family owned operation, that's all I need. You will not be disappointed in the French Roast."
positive,9/10/21,"I purchasesd this Post's Wheat& Bran Shredded Wheat at Wegman's for$2.00.  You can buy it at SuperFresh for $3.29.  How can you possibly price it at over $4 a box and call it a great buy?  MimSid7"
positive,6/3/21,"Bought these to go into ""welcome bags"" for those staying at the venue where my daughter was recently married.  Great way to purchase a lot for a great price."
positive,12/2/21,"I checked with my vet after purchasing these online for my cats and the difference in price is $10 cheaper on Amazon than at the vet's office!  Great deal!!"
positive,2/12/20,"My vet recommended these treats to help with my cats tartar build up. The treats come in a wrapper which I think is edible but I take it off. One cat LOVES these treats and the other won't touch them. But...the AMZN price is so so much cheaper (about 1/3 the cost) than the vets price. I wouldn't buy them anywhere but AMZN."
positive,20/11/19,"i've used stevia for a long time and love the natural product.  this is a good price as I normally spend around $15 for only one bottle half the size of these 4 oz ones."
positive,25/6/21,way overpriced Jewel has this for $2.79 same bag size. and look at the overpriced shipping cost.
negative,17/3/20,"The price doubled and is now over 30.00 , too much for 6 17.7-Ounce Boxes . Company is too greedy , I use to buy this regularly but I will no more"
positive,20/10/21,"I prefer pu'erhs that are earthy, slightly smoky, and finish smoothly. While this tea doesn't completely fit this profile, it will do. It isn't as good as some pricier pu'erhs but it's as good an everyday tea as I have found. Other tea lovers in my family have adopted it as their regular morning tea even though they are not the pu'erh aficionados that I am."
positive,21/7/20,I love Goya tomato sauce and its not sold in my town. Amazon had it cheaper than I normally pay. Plus the added bonus of not having to drive 30 minutes and pay taxes on it. The only downside would be the mail carrier. More than half the cans arrived dented. Amazon was nice enough to refund some of the cost.
positive,22/2/21,A lot cheaper than the store and the bulk will make it last a little longer than usual. Always great flavor and constancy with this product
negative,8/6/21,"I must be out of my mind to pay this much for almond milk. I meant organic almond milk at whole food and trader's joe is about $2 a piece. I didn't pay attention, I've always assumed that I could get a better deal from amazon. In this case, it's not. Lesson learned."
positive,2/12/20,"I tried this product because I have relatives who are diabetic and I'm always looking for low carb alternatives. The muffins have a somewhat cornbread kind of taste, and were a little dull in taste. I added a few frozen blueberries and this helped a lot.  My only complaint is that these mixes are quite expensive, and I may not be able to order as many as I would  like. They will have to be a treat rather than a staple....too bad."
positive,20/11/19,With the economy so tight I feel fortunate to have found the cat food my cats like for a price I can afford.  Thanks!
positive,25/1/21,This was a great price as opposed to the Wal-Mart price for the same brand. My kids love to eat these as an after school snack and this price allows me to provide them with this.<br /><br />Olivia
positive,1/7/21,"Not much you can say about this product. the are what it says. the balance between nuts is fair, the price was great, and while I doubt that each package is exactly 100 calories, it is was a great deal.<br /><br />most important were the price and the nuts. as stated good price compared to local markets (including target) and they ARE FRESH.<br /><br />nuff said"
positive,30/9/20,Case pricing is very favorable.  Great to have a stock on hand for preparing meals for the freezer.  Super quick shipping.
positive,15/3/20,"I've been having this product delivered for a long time and it always beats local prices. Also saves me from trying to find it on sale at the local market."
positive,6/7/21,"I grew up with Lipton tea, so maybe at 67 I'm addicted. I love the taste and how it does not get bitter if I leave the teabag in too long."
positive,29/6/21,Skippy peanut butter is a product consumed in my home quite frequently. Good product at a reasonable cost delivered free to my home - a good deal!
positive,29/6/21,Excellent customer service and I received the item sooner than expected. Price was lower than in stores.
positive,26/7/21,"This price does not even begin to be competitive with my local grocery stores, let alone Sam's Club or Walmart."
negative,21/10/21,"I bought this item for my granddaughter's birthday.  Thought by the info that it would be more creative and crafty.  It turned out to be mostly candy.  Not worth the price at all.<br /><br />The box looked nice and attractive except for one corner being severly dented.  Consequently their packageing also needs some work."
positive,25/10/21,"The coffee itself is great, but how can Amazon be charging $20.05 for a 24 count box when MSRP is $13.95 and you can find it at specialty shops for around $11.00?"
positive,29/6/21,I brought this because it was on sale but my dogs love this stuff very fresh and moist will order again when on sale:)
positive,5/7/21,"These are the same treats that my vet sells, but they are cheaper on-line.  The delivery was fast and ordering was easy.  Dog loves them."
positive,17/9/21,I was buying these at my vet for more than twice the price; My beagles love them; they are their favorite snack. Super fast shipping too!
positive,18/8/21,"Pretty standard syrup here.  I use it for lattes.  You can't beat the pricing on Amazon for any of the Torani Syrups."
positive,31/7/21,"Best buy for your money, smaller boxes of this item is just too expensive.  Lasts for months with no complaints,."
positive,18/10/21,"Great price for a lot of creamer. Just a bit at a loss of what to do with a giant box of creamers! Was hoping they'd come packed a little differently, but it's not a big deal."
negative,29/6/21,Wayyyyy overpriced! K cups should average you around .50 cents a cup ! ! !
negative,16/9/21,"This is the most expensive coconut juice I have ever purchased.  For some reason, I thought it would taste more natural and refreshing than Goya or Foco, which tastes more sweet than natural.  Nope, I was wrong.  It tastes exactly the same as the others, and has the same exact ingredients from Thailand."
negative,24/8/21,"I see alot of good reviews for this product. It had the ingrediants I was looking for at a great price. Unfortunately, my cat just didnt go for it. We usually get blue buffalo or Taste of the Wild."
positive,24/6/21,"I live in Indianapolis an have paid as much<br />as $3.65! The low side is $2.75, but they sell<br />out fast at that locition. So believe me this is<br />worth it, pluse a very good product! I love them!"
negative,27/9/21,"the item is awesome, but the 6 pack is about $30 at babies r us, this is a rip-off"
negative,29/6/21,why pay $36 here when you can get the same thing directly at the Honeyville site for $28?
negative,5/8/21,Bought this in sept. and did not pay to much attention to price at 16.83  3lb box and then saw them in the store for 7.99. Boy did i feel  like an idiot.  do your comparison shopping and do not waste your money on 3rd party sellers.Update.. Food 4 less had this box for 6.49 good buy and the cookies were fresh this time ?
negative,29/6/21,"Wasabi peas are delicious, healthy, natural, and a great alternative to less healthy snacks. However, these particular Wasabi peas are way over priced. You're much better off buying in bulk, like these excellent <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002VXZ40"">Wasabi Peas</a>. They are just as tasty, and much, much cheaper."
negative,31/7/21,"This is the most expensive water I've seen. Who are they marketing to...lottery winners only? Nobody should pay this much."
negative,11/9/21,"The exact same brand of rice is available at our local store for a 1/4th of the price. The current price on here is a whopping $73.15 not including shipping. Yikes! :o It's decent rice, the last time I bought it, it lasted over a year, we kept it in the closet, just folded the top part up, and put something decently heavy on it since it's not really easy to seal back up after you've opened it."
positive,12/8/21,"Love the large size Gevalia morning roast.  It makes about 1 1/2 mugs of coffee.  Just enough to keep you going through the morning.  The flavor is perfect, not too strong and not bitter.  The three pack is a great value.  This price is way better than buying from the grocery store or department stores.  A wonderful way to start your day."
positive,31/7/20,"I really like the Cappucino flavor of this soy milk and drink it daily at breakfast. I've given it a 5-star rating, but find that it is much too pricey from Amazon. I will continue to purchase it at my local market for less than $3 a carton."
positive,13/6/20,"I think this is new on the market and got a free sample.  It tastes delicious like Pina Colada but not too sweet/heavy, low-cal and uses sucralose (aka Splenda) which is closer to natural sugar and supposedly better for you then aspartame (NutraSweet), (would be even better with stevia).  But at $2.50 a pop, that's $75 to get your Vitamin D each month.  Still if you are into fufu nutritional drinks and you got the money to spend, this is one of the better ones I've run across.  If I could get it for under $2 a pop, I could get hooked on it. These guys are obviously competing with the likes of Vitamin Water which comes in 20 oz bottles instead of 14.5 and can be had for cheaper.  Interesting bottle shape though.  They'll have to probably drop the price or say bye bye, at least in this economy."
positive,31/7/20,"Our dogs really go crazy for these.  They are really good for their teeth and they seem to be able to digest them easily.  They are small dogs, so I let them have them for about 20 or  30 minutes and then i take them away.  Bully sticks are really expensive at the pet store.  I saw two for about 8 bucks.  too much.  These are a great deal."
positive,13/6/20,"These bully sticks have been a blessing, they keep my puppy busy for a good length of time."
positive,26/9/20,"I know it's just double more here than what I found locally, but wait it's double!<br />I don't know about this source anymore, I shop here very cautiously now since I find a lot of products overpriced  big time!"
negative,17/10/20,I needed some of these in a rush and ordered online. There is no difference between this and the ones I get in the store locally except the price which is 10 times more.
positive,14/12/20,"Great food for my cat.  He always looks healthy, sleek, and shiny.  Has been his diet for 3 years.  The last time I ordered this food from Amazon it was around $11.  Why the big price increase?  Will look local now."
positive,29/5/20,"These are great cacao nibs!  Wonderful in recipes!  I even substituted them for chocolate chips in  Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Bread recipe I had.  It turned out very good!  These are also great chopped up in the food processor & used in raw food snacks.  I did have a problem with my first shipment from Amazon, one of the bags burst open due to their poor packing.  BUT Amazon sent me a new shipment for free so no complaints there!  Organic Pure Raw Cacao Nibs enjoyment the healthy way!"
positive,9/12/20,I used these to make several small batches of vanilla sugar for Christmas presents. Worked great and very affordable. Thanks!
positive,4/8/20,"I just paid $6.49 at my local Costco.  I don't know why they are so expensive here.  I love these little cookies."
positive,31/7/20,"I have 5 dogs & Kibbles N' Bits is their favorite. Usually too expensive but the price is low right, 12.30 so I stocked up & bought 4 bags before the price increases again."
positive,13/6/20,Saves us a lot of money getting the refill packs than buying from the local store. we go through a lot of coffee and this is the only kind the boss likes so its a win-win.
positive,21/11/20,I have a hard time finding Half & Half in the stores locally and the Keurig site can be expensive. Very happy to find a supply!
positive,25/5/21,I love these gummy bears but I can buy the same bag 6 lb bag for $5.96 at SamsClub.  Thus the Amazon price is a rip off.  I wish Amazon would work to provide us the lowest prices.
positive,25/5/21,"Same thing I buy in the grocery store, but 1/3 cheaper and I didn't have to use my expensive gas to go get it."
negative,20/1/21,"I found this exact same product elsewher for a much better price. It was only $11.99 per bag.

positive,8/2/21,"Bottled water is just about all the same to me so I look for price. Even with the shipping cost, this 24 pack is the best bargain I've seen. It's cheaper than in my local grocery store and I don't have to carry it home."

positive,9/10/20,"If you like instant this is a good deal.  I priced it at Cub, a local grocery store, and the unit price was about two bucks less.  This tastes fine.  It tastes like instant coffee."
positive,31/7/20,"I thought that this was a decent price when I ordered it. Two days later I went to a foodstore which had not carried it and found that they had begun stocking the litter for $7.98. I like this product(and so does my fussy cat), but feel that I have been ripped off."
positive,13/6/20,"Pig ears keep our dogs quiet for a while, but I couldn't believe how much they cost.  With three dogs, price counts.  These are slivers, not whole ears, but they are still cheaper than the grocery store.  Our dogs love them, and the little one can handle the slivers while the whole ears a little too big."
positive,5/12/20,"I lived in Italy and grew very accustomed to great coffee.  LavBlu is as good as any I've had.  It costs a bit more in stores, so if you order more than three cans or so, it's probably saving you money.  If you order six or so as I do, even with the shipping, it's a bargain. Buy the Rosa if you're making on the stove as this is too fine for a stove.  With a machine, it's just outstanding.  New Lines Sales is easy to deal with, quick and responsive"
positive,1/11/20,I personally love this cereal and i know it maybe too plain for some but you have the option of being creative with this.helps me keep calories in check.
positive,14/1/21,"Good Product, good price, just be prepared to eat a lot of grits, lol.  I kind of got tired of grits and donated 6 boxes to a food pantry, however, it had nothing to do with the quality of the product.<br /><br />12 boxes is a lot of grits to eat.  Next time I think I will spring for the variety pack with the cheese flavors in them."
positive,6/6/21,"We have enjoyed Eight O'Clock 50/50 coffee for several years. I keep an eye on the price at the 2 local grocery stores and try to stock up when it goes on sale, which is not often. Amazon has been putting the whole beans on sale rather regularly and the price is far better than the grocery store. The beans store well in the freezer. It's delivered right to your door, so what's not to love about that?"
positive,21/7/20,"I bought a set for both my husband and my son.  They both loved it!  Very cute size, handy to put in your pocket to have when dining out, and a good price."
positive,5/1/21,"This are the cheapest bags I've found! They don't have any weird scent and are big enough for big-dog waste."
negative,23/1/21,"Have others noted how overpriced the grocery items are? Even factoring what you would pay with tax, this is just not a good deal. I can purchase Annie's mac and cheese for 1.19 at my local grocery store. This price works out to 1.57 a box. What gives with the high prices???"
negative,31/7/20,"I typically by these juice boxes in the store for $3.49-$3.99 for a pack of 8.  I should have checked with the seller on tha actual count, but was shocked that they are selling the same box for $14 and change! Lesson learned, and I am very disappointed.<br /><br />On the other hand, my kiddos love the drinks and I love that they don't have as much sugar as the other drinks."
positive,13/6/20,"This a great price for the quantity you get.  Arrowroot powder is so expensive if you buy it in the spice section of the supermarket.  Buying online is MUCH cheaper.  It's a great thickening agent.  Has same consistency as corn flour.  I use this to make primal/paleo bread (made from almond flour)."
positive,1/12/20,"When I'm in a hurry, I can always count on these potato products from Betty Crocker to make a hit without much of an effort on my part."
positive,30/1/21,We found this pearl sugar after looking at a recipe in a King Arthur Flour Catalog.  It seems to be quite a bit cheaper then what you would pay at most specialty shops.  My wife uses it with Swedish Braided Bread.  Good stuff.
positive,1/1/21,"I have to admit as far as this little luxury of maple syrup goes it's all about price. Kirkland products tend to be of good quality and fair pricing though, so, always a good place to start.<br /><br />Since maple syrup is a single ingredient food and not something I eat every day I really don't find all that much variation in taste from one brand to the next. This Kirkland syrup tastes just as good as about any other with *important consideration* for comparisons being fair, i.e of the same color+grade. I did not find this to be thinner than other brands either.<br /><br />Great on pancakes, waffles, crepes, aebleskiver. I've also recently started experimenting with using maple syrup instead of sugar in for certain recipes as it is a more pure, less processed form of sweetening.<br /><br />Pleased with this product and recommended."
positive,11/1/21,"Bought this to put in party favor bags.  Price was great, item arrived quickly, and fruit snacks tasted great.  Would definitely order again."
positive,31/7/20,I like buying these in bulk as it they are easier to store in the box. Good product. Usually beats the price at my local stores.
positive,13/6/20,"I order this coffee for work all the time through Amazon and it's the cheapest and best around. I will continue ordering."
positive,14/1/21,"These are going to be a hit at my wedding.  Haven't tried them yet, but who doesn't love a Hershey Kiss?!?!?!"
negative,7/12/20,"Walmart has the 48 family sized tea bags for $5.99, so you can get the same 96 family sized tea bags from Walmart for half the price $11.99"
positive,5/5/21,"I've had better White Peony, and it cost about three times as much.  For the price this is a very good tea.  Brew it around 170 degrees for 5 minutes and it has a very smooth, slightly sweet taste with no sweetener added.  My personal favorite is to add 2 parts White Peony to 1 part rooibos.  Give it a try!"
positive,23/11/20,got this on sale here for 8.00 which is just 1 dollars more then wholesale price.
positive,29/8/20,"I've been looking all over for a great priced cacao and finally found it here."
positive,18/1/21,first bought this product retail in Philadelphia Pa and the price was twice what is was online even with shipping included...great price and the cats love it.
positive,18/6/21,"This is a large amount of crystalized ginger and I don't think you could beat the price. I would have preferred it to be a bit more sweet to offset the heat of the ginger but it's still good."
positive,18/6/21,These pumpkin seeds were exactly the same as the ones they sell at markets for nearly $4 for half the price.
positive,7/7/21,"This coffee has become my morning ritual because in my opinion it is the best coffee pod for the price out there, though I haven't tried the other Melitta roasts (those are next on my list). It is so dark and rich, with a chocolate taste and a great body- reminds me of a good Americano (blows a Starbucks Americano out of the water). I've found the best method to getting the best out of this pod is to brew it using about 7 ounces of water with my BUNN MC pod brewer, on the 'tea' setting. This makes a very strong brew, so I add about 2 or 3 ounces of hot water to round it out. My only complaint about these pods is the consistency. It seems like I get a bad, bitter tasting pod here and there. There is also kind of a dry aftertaste. But in all honesty, it could be something I'm not doing right in the brewing process. I'm only taking off one star since I don't know what the issue is. Otherwise, I'm very very pleased with this coffee. I've not felt the need to go to a coffee shop since I purchased it. I will definitely be buying again."
positive,18/6/21,"When I order the beans I had opened the lid and the seal was already broken like it had been pushed in and I didn't want to eat them nor give them to my husband. So I had contacted the seller through Amazon and they said Throw them away and we will send you a new batch and they did just that no hassle and no problem and they shipped pretty fast. These beans very very good compared to some. We are coffee lovers and Dark chocolate lovers so we had to try this pair and glad we did. Oh did i mention it has a real coffee bean? LOL some that we have tried was like ground coffee bean bits not the whole bean. so over all good price, quality and the amount and it is yummy :)"
positive,7/7/21,"I've always been a little anxious to purchase groceries online, but I gave it a shot with this product and I'm satisfied! Great price and awesome product. If you're worried about purchasing it, just try it. You won't regret it."
positive,1/7/21,The caraway seeds are a really good value. I did encounter a problem with the time it took for the order to arrive. I bake for a farmers market and was depending on receiving the seeds on the date that I was given. Apparently there was a problem with the bags and had they just let me know I would have not kept expecting them. I finally contacted Amazon concerning my order and was then advised of the delay. I would order these caraway seeds again as they are fresh and well packed to stay that way.I hope I never have to resort to buying them in the grocery store again.
positive,7/7/21,"I use this flour to bake bread for my grandson who is on a gluten free diet.  I like the fact that is has no additives and that it is organic.  Can't beat the price!"
positive,23/7/21,"I couldn't find kettle corn popcorn in any stores other than three small bags in a box. I am very pleased to be able to buy a large batch and for such a good price. I have bought three different orders of this and will continue to do so."
positive,20/7/21,"This buckwheat flour is a great value and the quality is excellent.  I received promt answers to my questions from the company and found the customer service to be excellent.  I'll definitly be purchasing this flour again."
negative,19/7/21,"I couldn't find any cake flour at the grocery stores close by, so I decided to get it online. However, I just found out that you can get the exactly same product at Whole Foods for less than half the price. It's actually only $4.99 for a 32oz pack."
positive,18/6/21,"so much less expensive than other brands.  not very informative packaging, though, and who knows if it's organic or what.  a little clumpy.  but hey - as far as having no-sugar staples in the house, you can't beat the price!"
positive,7/7/21,"I have tried 4 different kinds of oolongs, and found this tea to have a very rich, woodsy taste. It brews a dark red/brown color in comparison to some other lighter oolongs, which brew golden. Although it tastes quite strong, which I like, it lacks the sweet aromatic flavors that I love in a previous oolong I've tasted. Those tend to be much more expensive, so I settled for this one. It tastes pretty good & seems good quality for the price. I'm pretty much addicted to oolong tea, so I needed something that I could buy at a good price & still enjoy."
negative,27/6/21,"I was advised by a health care professional to eat prunes daily as a means of supplementing my fiber intake.  I was skeptical, but I gave it a try.  I discovered to my mild astonishment that prunes can taste better than I remembered them from distant past experiences, and here they are available on Amazon.  The prunes are available as a Kirkland product, and Costco shoppers realize that Kirkland is the Costco store brand, or something like that.<br /><br />So, I was further actually astonished to discover that my local Costco store sells this same product, 3.5 pound bag, for the amount of $6.40 instead of the $18 to $20 price as they are on Amazon.  Why should anyone pay that much when the same item is sold in Costco stores for $6.40?  Is this some kind of a gouge?"
negative,21/7/21,"this is regularly $2.50 per 12pk on sale at local grocery stores, even the MSRP is only $4.99<br />Buyer Beware !"
positive,18/6/21,"I had tried several stevia products in the past and always threw them out because they were awful. This one is pretty good.  I admit, it's not the best-tasting sweetener, but I suppose it's the healthiest alternative (so far as we know anyways), thus it's the one I use. I use to use Equal many years ago, but it gave me a headache and I found out it was a neurotoxin. Then I started using Splenda, which is the best in my opinion as far as taste goes. But now you hear about it not being that great either (healthwise), being chlorinated and all, so I stopped using it. Then I tried Truvia. Like I said, it's not the best - it does leave a bit of an aftertaste with tea, and using it for whipped cream did not work at all, I ended up having to add a bunch of powdered sugar to the cream to make it edible. I primarily use it to sweeten my greek yogurt with berries, as I still need a touch of sweetness, so one packet is great, tastes good. I also use it for my other low carb dessert - 2-3 oz cream cheese with a few berries and one packet of Truvia, also good."
positive,7/7/21,"I ordered three of these thru amazon prime, no longer available as of 11-15-11. My last order was oct 4th 2011 and price was $26.00 and now the price from outside vendor is Around  $45.00 plus $9.00 shipping. That is over double the amazon price from last month. I rate this product 5 stars for being natural but one star for current price gouging. It blends well and has a nice flavor.  I won't order again until amazon sells it."
positive,30/6/21,"this is a really good thing to do if you drink coffee and use creamer. The price with subscrib & save saves you almost a 1.00 a container. try it you'll like it and its deliveried to you"
positive,1/7/21,"I bought a 25 lb bag of red quinoa from this company. We are pleased with both the taste and the price. It's a much better deal than buying quinoa in small packages. I hardly use rice anymore because the quinoa tastes better and has more protein."
positive,24/8/21,"This is the brand I normally buy, but the price on Amazon is less than half of supermarket price.  I bake bread all the time, and the expiration date on these is February, 2013. Will buy again. Thanks Amazon for a very good deal."
positive,21/7/21,I add a tbsp of this flaxseed to our morning smoothies for health benefits.  Amazon sells the product for almost half the price I have found at local grocery stores. Keep the open bag in the freezer to preserve freshness.
positive,25/6/21,"got the same product for almost half the price at local supermarket.<br />my dogs LOVE this product so i guess i will be getting it locally.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006FS0PCE"">Dog Chow Senior 7+ Healthy Morsels Dog Food, 8-Pound</a>"
positive,13/9/21,"This is one of the best espresso coffee brands in the price range, definitely recommend over cafe bustelo. I order the 4 pack every few weeks."
positive,18/6/21,"This ends up being about half the price that I would pay at any store and it tastes exactly the same as the packets!  Dont be fooled by people saying ""its cheaper at Walmart"" because they are referring to the 8oz sizes.  Walmart doesnt even carry these 16oz sizes, not even online.  I bought 4 of these containers and I recommend you do the same!"
positive,7/7/21,This is a great tasting product with the best price I could find online or in the store.  This is my favorite flavor they offer.
positive,15/7/21,"I've been very happy with the results of this yeast. It's been my yeast of choice for several batches of cider and mead, and it has more than done its job! I love that you get 10 packages for such a low price. No cons as far as I'm concerned."
positive,11/7/21,This product is really delicious. I use it for stir fries since I am no longer interested in meat. Quick and handy to have. Will continue to buy.[...]
positive,7/10/21,"Good price even with the shipping costs. Chocolate arrived in perfect condition.<br /><br />I use this chocolate for baking, it's excellent"
positive,6/7/21,"Great company, when item came in stock they let me know, I ordered it and it came quickly. Definately a company to buy from!"
positive,18/6/21,"Arrived undamaged and on time. Add's a nice touch to beans and rice. Not alot of flavor but not a bad addition to the spice rack."
positive,7/7/21,"I was so glad to find this on amazon and free shipping with the subscribe and save. It's much cheaper than buying smaller bags in town. I mix it with regular oatmeal to stretch it and its so healthy for you.  I haven't tried baking with it but am a total addict when it comes to eating it for breakfast as a hot cereal."
positive,27/7/21,"I like Bob's Red Mill products and this four pack is a good price, at least where I live. The potato starch works well in gluten free recipes."
negative,13/7/21,"I like the product, but at nearly [...] bucks per 24 pack it is way overpriced. I would buy it again if it was priced at about 40% less.  I do like it for an afternoon boost, but in the mornings I need full strength rocket fuel."
positive,13/9/21,"I bought this a few weeks ago and really like this product. This is my first time buying this product, and I find that it easy to cook (in a rice cooker!) and has a really nice chewy texture. The flavor is nutty and good too. If you like brown rice and/or wild rice, I think you will like this. The only downside for me is the price. I can buy a 20 lb (yes, that's right) bag of good white rice at an Asian market for $15."
positive,7/9/21,"I eat quite a bit of sushi, and I have to say this sushi nori is up to par. Overall, the flavor is fine and the quality is amazing for the price. Can't do much better than this if you're trying to be conservative with what you spend on sushi."
negative,17/4/21,"These taste great and are pretty addictive, but this same box was about $5 at my local Ralph's supermarket. Don't buy this from Amazon!"
positive,10/3/21,"Ever since starting my diet/change of life a couple years ago, I started cutting out sugar drinks, and substitution with Crystal Light.  I dring a gallon a day, and it cuts down on unneccessary calories.  Prices on this is all over the place, but for me, this is the cheapest and the EXACT same as anything you would buy anywhere else."
positive,17/4/21,If you love Cheez-It Snack mix this is a must have for your pantry.  The price is great.  You get three boxes.  I put them into snack bags for my kids so they are always available for them.
positive,21/1/21,"Much cheaper than buying them at our local store, and a great 100 cal snack. Good taste, so no complaints."
negative,30/1/21,Maxwell House ground coffee from the supermarket is beter coffee. Searched underorganic coffee and got Lavazza. Amazon should give me about $13.00 back as a credit!..... Dave
positive,13/2/21,"This is my favorite coffee ordered online, and I have ordered quite a few.  Bold but not bitter, and good for a crowd.  This is also a very nice price for good coffee, from what I have found."
positive,15/1/21,"The price is great and the teas are individually wrapped which is a plus since the exterior box of mine was torn and tapped in places.  Haven't tired them yet, but the box says not to use them in more than 3 cups of water."
positive,6/3/21,"I started buying this brand of food when my dog had a litter of puppies (I bought the puppy-lover's bag).  I loved that it has wholesome ingredients, and that ""meat"" is the first ingredient on the list.  Look through the bags of dog foods at your grocer and you'll see that meat isn't first or second, and then when you find it you'll find it only contains ""meat by-products.""  My pets have had a healthy coat & firm stools eating this brand of dog food, and you can't beat the price.  The added chelated minerals and natural preservatives create a holistic pet food.  I will continue to feed this to my dogs and recommend it to my friends as well."
positive,8/6/21,"Got this for my lab, who is far from a fussy eater.  Wanted to get her something healthy and not break the bank.  This seems to fit the bill.  Comes in a 35 lb bag so I don't have to reorder too often."
positive,7/1/21,"I had my dog on PetSmart's brand of food that is gluten free.  But it came in small bags and they charged an arm and a leg to ship a larger bag.  Chicken Soup got a great review from dog food review sites.  My dog eats it and seems to love it."
positive,17/4/21,"This is the best product ever for making chili!  Delicious, simple and easy!  But this price is ridiculous!  We can get it for $1.12 at Walmart."
positive,10/3/21,"I was able to save about 20.00 by purchasing these through Amazon, as opposed to our local grocery store.  Since we go through a box a week, the savings can add up quickly.  Would definitely recommend."
negative,14/1/21,"This is for 4 six pack boxes. You can get these boxes for 6.99 at Target, so this price is over $10 more. My bad for not checking the local price beforehand. I won't make that mistake again!"
negative,24/5/21,I will buy a new coffee maker before I will pay that much for the cup holder! I think it is due to the availability of the product.
positive,14/10/21,"We have this on automatic order with Amazon to take advantage of the improved pricing. We go through about 1 32 ounce box per day and buying from amazon saves us a ton of money (prime members so no shipping cost).<br /><br />Every once in a while we get a box that was beat up a little bit but not that big of a deal for the amount of money we save buying this stuff in bulk.<br /><br />I am 100% certain that should I ever feel like complaining to amazon about the shipping issue, they would send me a replacement pronto. That being said, it's really no big deal."
negative,7/2/21,Check around. There is a very large markup on this product.<br /><br />I like the idea of giving out animal cookies instead of so much surgery candy. Kids get too many sweets these days with corn syrup in everything.
positive,29/3/21,Great tasting and a nice medium roast. This coffee is a great deal for the price.<br />We really like the export also but for 1/2 the price this is a winner.
positive,17/4/21,"These are better quality beans than you find in most grocery stores.  This is my second shipment and noticed this time the cans were packaged better.  I didn't have any cans that were dented.  The price is better than the grocery stores too."
negative,10/3/21,"The rice is a fine rice, but the price is awfully high.  I can buy a 20 lb bag of this for $24, and a 40 lb. bag for $42 at a local store."
negative,10/7/21,"this item is over priced.  I but the 12oz pack ""Sunsweet One California Prunes"" individually wraped for $3.88 a bag (carried at most Walmarts).  If I buy 6bags @ $3.88, I spend only $23.28. i give the product rating a 5, but your charge if definitely over prices.  ~Gwen"
positive,27/1/21,"Not the best canned mushrooms on Earth, but the price is good and they are definitely OK for tossing in a pot of spaghetti sauce or using as an extra ingredient in a soup or stir fry when there are no fresh mushrooms in the house. Just make sure that you rinse them thoroughly first, as they have a slightly canned taste if they aren't washed."
positive,1/6/21,"Local markets don't carry wild rice or charge about $6 for 6 ounces. After searching the net, this was the best deal I could find and it is a good, high quality rice that cooks up great. Enjoy!"
negative,20/8/21,"Unsaid in the description of this item is the fact that you receive only one box for $10.95. The same item can be purchased Directly from Dreamfields for only $2.99, which probably explains why this ad does not reveal the number of boxes in an order."
negative,14/8/21,"Love these little packs of raisinets (hooray for portion control!) and when I saw them on amazon, I thought it was a great deal.  6 boxes of 6 packs of raisins!  I pay around $3 for a 6 pack at the grocery store, so this seemed like a really good bargain.  Boy, was I wrong.  I didn't get 6 boxes of the 6-packs, I got ONE six pack.  Which, according to amazon, has a retail price of 20 bucks!  That's insane.<br /><br />Fortunately, a quick chat with customer service refunded my purchase, but I was still disappointed to find it was ONE pack and not 6."
positive,21/4/21,"It's Splenda, and at a good price.  Forget about the individual packets, the cost will kill you.  If you use the product, this is the way to buy it."
positive,1/4/21,It is getting harder and harder to find refills for Pez.  This was a great deal.
positive,17/4/21,"My husband wanted this gift for Christmas, but they were out of stock at Books A Million. So I ordered it on Amazon. The following week I was shopping at Target it and found the PEZ dispensers for $7.00 cheaper."
positive,10/3/21,"This is the second brand I've tried. I was surprised that it smelled different. It tastes great and works just the same as the other more expensive brand. I will be ordering more! If you haven't ever tried using it as a moisturizer...try it! My skin can be oily in the summer, but this is not heavy or greasy even in the summer. And it works better than ANYTHING I have tried for winter dry/chapped skin! Tastes great in everything from stir-fry to cinnamon rolls too."
positive,22/4/21,"Much cheaper at costco  much much much much much much, a lot a lot a lot cheaper. like $ 10.00 bucks"
positive,25/4/21,"Really pricey.  I think a 45-gallon barrel is that much at the warehouse.  I first cancelled, they did not respond so I went ahead and accepted.  Certainly not economical."
negative,1/4/21,"This is great candy, smooth and flavorful with a great 'mouth"" as the TV chefs like to say.<br /><br />However-- six bucks for ten pieces of hard candy?  The dollar store stocks this pretty regularly. Same brand, same size-- one dollar."
negative,30/6/21,"There isn't a whole lot that is special about Stride Gum. I kind of got annoyed chewing it all the time. It doesn't really freshen your breath and you don't get the ""clean"" feeling of other gums. It doesn't really last that long either so I wasn't too fond of it. Either way if your a fan of Stride go for it."
positive,1/3/21,I had wanted to try this tea and the combination of teapot and tea was irrestible. The tea is very good and the teapot is great when it is just myself sitting down and relaxing. I have used the large bamboo container to set out guest tea selections in my home and the small container to carry tea with me camping. I would also recomend this as a gift to someone special.
positive,29/1/21,"This is really good price for loose leaf earl grey tea! It smells wonderful and tastes great too. The quality is definitely comparable with Teavana and other more expensive loose leaf tea, but only costs 1/4 as much."
positive,17/4/21,Comes in a plastic bag so you really need to have a container to put it in. Good flavor and a good value. I bought for a gift and they like it very much.
positive,10/3/21,"Great price, especially if you have amazon prime and sign up for the subscriptions. You don't have to remember to pick up wet food, and carry it home. Also the price here is the same price that I can get the cans at discount stores and on sale."
positive,30/5/21,It came right when it was supposed to. Well packaged. Nearly half the price I normally pay at retail stores!
positive,28/9/21,"I have enjoyed Big Franks for years.  Now that Amazon carries them I can get them delivered to my door at a price (including shipping, subscription plan) that is lower than I can find anywhere else."
positive,6/5/21,"My husband uses all of these favors in his coffee drinks; it is hard to pick a favorite because they all taste so rich and flavorful. They are in plastic bottles, wrapped up nice and sent quickly. My husband scoffed when I originally bought this pack, but once it arrived (the next day, love amazon!) He thought I was a genius! With two vanillas (regular and French) hazelnut, peppermint, caramel, and raspberry it's a great selection for a great price. Highly recommended."
positive,20/4/21,"I love Amazon!  I ordered this on Tuesday for my weekend baking and we received it on Thursday.  Best price around and delivered right to the door.  Easy peasy!  The can was a bit dented on the bottom, but the contents were not affected."
positive,20/4/21,"I like the product and bought because I was not able to find it here locally though I had previosly purchased it at CostCo (Charleston, SC).  I should have looked more closely at the price because I was shocked I paid almost $70 for three 40 oz. jars.  My fault, but I will not be ordering any more on line."
positive,21/4/21,"My dad loves this product, the local stores sell one small box for an excess of $5.00 for one 8oz box.  He eats this desert everyday now that we have enough.  It tastes just as good as the store bought product for a fraction of the cost.  Great Product!"
positive,2/5/21,"I switched to Felidae canned cat food to help control the weight of my cats; my vet says some cats don't metabolize the carbs of dry food well. I started with Science Diet, but that quickly broke the bank. After 4 months, I'm happy to report my cats have lost weight eating this cat food. My dog gets Canidae (same brand as Felidae) All Life Stages dry kibble which I also recommend."
positive,25/5/21,My wife drinks diet tonic water by the gallon.  She loves the taste of this - and it saves us a lot of money.  Highly recommended!
positive,7/9/21,This was such a great price on this cereal.  I was paying $1 every day from our cafeteria for these.
positive,25/5/21,This item is way over priced.  Check your local walmart and find it way cheaper!  The juice is great tasting with kids!
positive,22/5/21,Pumpkin seeds are hard to find in the stores without an outrageous price. This is a great deal.
positive,19/7/21,"I was a bit skeptical at getting another brand than Green Mountain brands, since Grove Square and San Fran Bay were really bad. Besides the original problem they had with the production on their first boxes, Brooklyn Beans have been a great new find for us. I could go through each blend, but they are all similar to other GMCR brands. The k cups seem a little lighter in weight and the lighter roasts  did seem watery for the travel cup size, but that is about the norm with all k cups. The best thing I really like is the company actually responds and fixes any problems. So, stop complaining about the shipping when you are leaving feedback on the product! (I always get my shipments at least 2 days ahead of scheduled date.) So, don't be afraid to try these and save money. Subscribe and save another 5%."
positive,7/9/21,Love this coffee . No problems brewing .Cannot beat the price realy good coffee and afordable.customer service was top notch .We raise our coffee cup to you
negative,25/8/21,"The soup is delicious.......the price is not!<br /><br />I purchased an 8 pack of this soup for under twenty dollars delivered about 6 months ago direct from Amazon. Unfortunately it looks like we now have to go through a reseller to obtain this product and pay an inflated price, hence the one star rating. I'm down to my last can but I cannot bring myself to pay this much for soup!"
negative,6/9/21,This salt is way overpriced. Go to your local store and buy Morton Sea Salt.<br />Saltygator
positive,25/5/21,My dog is older and on several pills a day.  .  she just loves these pill pockets.  She swallows them whole and does not know that there is  a pill hidden inside.  I loved buying them in bulk and geting a great price.
positive,7/9/21,"I have two small dogs that both require medicating 3 times a day.  This product is a life saver.  They stand at the counter and bark to remind me when it is time for their medicine.  The pill pockets are pricey, but at Amazon you can save a bundle compared to buying them at the vet's office.  If you opt for standard shipping, plan on a good week's time for your order to arrive."
positive,13/10/21,"Thank you Amazon for carrying Amy's at such a reasonable price! I paid about $27 for this case, when they were trying to charge me $40 for it at my health food store. These are the BEST refried beans I've ever had---they taste even better since I add about a half a jar of salsa (mild, great value brand from Walmart) per can. I love them because they don't taste like oil and they don't make me feel sick afterwards, as other refried bean brands sometimes do.<br />I definitely recommend!"
positive,2/10/21,I now will never run out of food for my cats.  They both love it every time and I love the price.
positive,23/9/21,This is an excellent product but unfortunately its not eligible for super saver shipping so the cost is too much per tart
positive,26/6/21,this is product is what i always drink after eating my dinner. I love this product. I will deffinitely buy more after 6 months because i purchased 6 boxes of this so they will be good for 6 months.
positive,25/5/21,I have purchased these crackers in the supermarket for twice the price.  these were very fresh and arrived in 4 days.  very good buy
negative,7/9/21,"I was surprised when the catnip arrived to find it was only a one ounce tin.  The listing did not say how much was in the tin (my fault I guess). I just found the same size tin of this same catnip at a high end natural food store for only $4.95.  This is good stuff, but overpriced and can probably be found locally for a lot less."
positive,15/7/21,"We eat a box a week of these crackers, so ordering in bulk from Amazon helps us cut costs!  And they deliver it to us monthly through subscribe and save!"
positive,3/6/21,"If you can get past the fact that this does not arrive in any form of a ""package"" with the picture that is shown your good!  If you are looking for a great assortment of flavors that would be impossible to get all on your own...then this is for you too.  I was very pleased with the assortment, and how fun to go through and pick your flavor to try each time.  I purchased this for myself since my huband is more loyal to only one plain flavor k-cup and I like variety."
positive,27/9/21,"Needed Mimi Moo's in a hurry and you delivered!  Thank you - our customers appreciate it! We appreciate the low price!"
positive,19/6/21,"I like Bob's Red Mill flours and the sorghum flour is great too. The pack of 4 is a great price (at least where I live) and it works well in creating the recipes from my gluten free cookbook."
negative,25/5/21,"$12.95 plus $5.99 to ship??!!  That's almost $19 for a box of cookies that costs about $4.59 in the store.  Is this guy smoking something?  Are people buying these at this price?  These are a good cookie, but in no way are they worth $19 a box.  Just another rip-off.  There is even a much cheaper alternative right here on Amazon.  Keep looking. You'll find a much better deal than from this guy."
negative,7/9/21,"I found these for much less ($2.50 + $2.55) at two other places here on amazon, do not buy from here, free shipping not worth it"
positive,3/8/21,I started using Swiss Miss Diet a few months ago and love it for on;y 25 calories. The price on Amazon far exceeds any grocery store in my area.
positive,5/9/21,"FOR THOSE WHO APPRECIATE CAPERS, THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO BUY.  THEY ARE THE SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO FIND SMALLER BUDS, AND THE PRICE CAN'T BE BEAT...PLUS, THEY WILL LAST FOREVER IN YOUR FRIG!  HAVING A GOOD SUPPLY AT A GOOD PRICE WILL ENCOURAGE SOME ADVENTUROUS COOKING."
positive,25/5/21,"My vet wanted this supplement for both my dogs.  This is the same supplement at a good discount from my vet's price.  Will be back again and again."
positive,7/9/21,"THis is the cheapest price I could find for citric acid. I use it to make detergent, so I needed a big bag. This was the right price, good quality and it got here fast. Highly recommend!"
positive,11/9/21,"Amazon does it again.  I use these noodles in a chicken soup recipe and I always get plenty of compliments on it.  The gnocchi is perfect and packaged wonderfully.  Price can't be beat either."
positive,13/7/21,"The product is so versatile and flavorful. I use it to make instant ginger tea, also to cook Asian style dishes or bake delicious cookies. I trust Frontier, they always carry high quality products, non irradiated and sulfur-free."
positive,22/7/21,We have been buying this coffee every month for six month.  It has a nice mellow earthy flavor with low acidity.  Considering I worked at starbucks for a few years I would say this is on par to their dark latin american blend.  The beans are always fresh.
positive,22/6/21,"Really enjoyed ordering and using this coffee. Reminds me of expresso in coffee shops throughout italy. I've never really used pre-packed coffee before as I've always preferred freshly ground. However, this taste fresh and yummy. Great head, not bitter, but still has good depth. Will continue to order every time I need more coffee.<br /><br />[...]"
positive,28/7/21,"I like giving my son some prunes once in a while to get him regular.  The price for this 12 pack is outstanding. It came neatly packed to prevent damage. I love Earth's Best baby food."
positive,13/10/21,"I don't think you can beat the value of this coffee, especially with the Subscribe and Save program! It is also a great French Roast with a full, deep flavor. It does not taste burnt like some of the Starbucks varieties, but is smooth and a little smokey. I like strong coffee, and so this is definitely the way to go for me. I've had compliments from visitors to our house on how good the coffee is, as well. I'm completely satisfied!"
positive,19/2/21,"I had read earlier that the Colombian Coffee by Eight O' Clock was judged to be the best brand for flavor and taste. I purchased the larger bags as they were a good buy for the price. I feel like a winner twice and have a great cup of coffee each morning, too!!"
negative,14/12/20,"I got a box of this tea from a bed and bath and beyond kind of store and really liked it so I came here to buy more expecting a good price on a larger box.  $1 a cup?  And a k-cup isn't even an 8-oz cup?!  Nuts.  You can get a box of 108 from a certain B wholesale J warehouse club for $48.99...45 cents each!  The tea was surprising good for not really 'brewing' but buy it elsewhere cheaper!"
positive,14/12/20,"There was a lot of food in a small package here, which was a pleasant surprise, honestly.<br /><br />Now, as a disclaimer, I should mention I've eaten more than my bodyweight in MREs, so my standards for 'edible and delicious' in long-term-storage-food might be a bit low, but I actually really dug this.<br /><br />The salmon spread was zippy and spicy without being too much, and just enough for the 6 crackers.  The edamame are darker looking than you see in the boxart, and do have a bit of a beany aftertaste.  I wish there was a bit less of those and way more of that fruit mix--unlike regular 'dried fruit' this had a nice gingery seasoning that made it really outstanding. I could eat just that and be a happy little camper.<br /><br />And the chocolate square is nummy. :D<br /><br />The downsides, as others have mentioned, is that for that price, you can probably go get something fresh-cooked to eat, and there is a good bit of waste--each individual plastic wrapper and the box itself.  The plus sides are that it is portable, it's tasty and it's quite handy.<br /><br />Will I buy it again?  I think so, honestly. Sometimes I don't have time the night before to pack up a healthy lunch from home and in that case, this would be a great way to stave off the temptation of the dreaded vending machine or the temptation to call out for pizza.  Not an every-day item for me, but as an occasional treat, definitely!"
positive,19/2/21,"I was super excited to find this online for a better price than my grocery store.  I've never used spelt flour before, but I made cookies with it and I liked them."
positive,10/1/21,"I was getting these for my pitbull mix from Walmart for around $15.  It takes him about 2 days to consume one and I haven't had problems with big pieces choking him like I do with other chews.  I only wish they were sold by the case!"
negative,26/3/21,"I know that you're taking a chance - after all they are flops but I think they're are overpriced."
negative,24/3/21,I have written to this company to try to get an answer as to why I was overcharged for this coffee.<br />I do not recommend buying this product until Liquid Nation is NOT ALLOWED to sell it.
positive,24/2/21,"If you love couscous but hate paying the price of the leading brand, give this one a try. I received my sampler set the other day and my family has been enjoying it ever since.You can add your own flavoring, chicken broth, garlic, or just salt and butter. This is a very good value and perfect to stock up your pantry with.."
negative,19/2/21,"This new ""Packaging"" is more expensive than the last plus it's smaller - 23.2 oz vs. the 25 in the old packaging.  Granted it's nice not having to fish around for the scooper, but there's no reason to increase pricing on this.  Target had the 25 oz for $19.99 at one point (maybe try to clear old packaging for new) - now it's at $21.05 still cheaper than what I've seen online - even for amazon- so far..."
positive,14/12/20,My daughter teaches kindergarten and I help her and the other 6 kindergarten 120 kids do gingerbread houses at Xmas.  Every year we have to buy the small tubes since M&m do does not sell the bags locally.  These 6 bags are much cheaper and we will have left overs for other projects.
positive,19/10/21,"These pretzels are almost addictive they are so good.  At $24 for the 12-pack they are a bargain as well, beating the local grocery stores."
negative,18/5/21,"Too much of a good thing? We worked this kibble in over time, slowly shifting the percentage of Felidae to national junk-food brand until the bowl was all natural. By this time, the cats couldn't keep it in or down. What a mess. We've moved on."
negative,19/2/21,"This candy is not as described. The middle is almost hard it is not a silky or smooth filling as described.<br />Looks and tastes like it's way past it's expiration date.<br />Would never reccommend this. Paid a good chunk of cash for nothing"
negative,18/5/21,"I've been drinking this tea for the past 8 or 10 years, usually buying a box or two when visiting large metropolitan areas, where many Middle-Eastern stores carry loose Ahmad teas, usually at $5-7 for a pound box.  I've always considered it an unremarkable but robust tea, with enough aroma and taste, and beautiful reddish color, perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own, but a decent base for mixes.<br />This tea, however, is nothing of the sort. Freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell, and the brewed tea is weak, flat and tasteless.  Somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore. So, you get a lot of tea for the money, but the quality is such that you might as well drink Lipton bags, they are not that much worse."
negative,18/6/21,"Five minutes in, one tentacle was bitten off, ball inside cracked in half. Not durable enough to be a dog toy. Disappointed :(. So is the dog :(."
negative,7/7/21,"I felt energized within five minutes, but it lasted for about 45 minutes. I paid $3.99 for this drink. I could have just drunk a cup of coffee and saved my money."
negative,18/6/21,"Yes, it's probably healthier than 5-Hour Energy or Starbucks shots but if you're looking to avoid a caffeine overload, this is still not for you. Most energy drinks cannot be made w/ out a high dosage of caffeine. I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL - probably lower than other un-healthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands b/c they contain too much caffeine and/or sugar. If you do not react well to caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either. I definitely feel an energy boost w/ 1 full Guayaki shot but not w/ out all the other caffeine side effects - irritability, nervousness, mood-swings. Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee. But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe.<br /><br />Now you're NOT sensitive to caffeine, then it's a great buy. It's not loaded w/ sugar. The taste is easy and pleasant. It's not loaded w/ a bunch of chemicals like 5-Hour shots or Starbucks drinks. And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours. Takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body/weight.<br /><br />Side note - if you want to feel energized during the day, have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy, fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy!"
negative,7/7/21,"I so wish I would have read this review before purchasing TWO gallons of this oil for my health issues. It reeks like a chemical rubber smell. This smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid. When I called to report the situation to the company, Sabrina told me I would have to pay to send them a sample to have tested by a lab. Unbelievable. Good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund, including shipping. The product is faulty. Period. I will never order anything from this company again and do not recommend it to anyone based on this horrible customer service and lack of responsibility and ownership."
negative,1/7/21,"This product has a strong after-taste of Crayola crayons!<br /><br />I am in the process of trying different brands of coconut oils for cooking purposes.  Upon opening the plastic container, the aroma of crayons immediately fills the room, and this flavor permeates the food that is cooked in it.<br /><br />I suspect the source of the problem is the plastic used in the plastic container as I have not experienced this with any of the other brands purchased.<br /><br />To date, my favorite coconut oil is distributed by Barleans.  The flavor is fantastic.  However, they do not supply a gallon-sized tub,and Dr. Mercola has the best product in that size category."
negative,7/7/21,"I used to buy this sugar for years. I do not eat much sugar, but still. This sugar is called turbinado sugar, but is misleading. I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar, and other brands (in the local food store) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something.<br /><br />HOW did i find out? I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!! What a shame on the producer! U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well.<br /><br />I'm just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice."
negative,23/7/21,"This is the first time I've really been misled by other reviews on amazon. I like 5-hr Energy, I find Rain ok and so I thought I'd try this product based on the reviews. Boy am I sorry! I gagged getting one bottle down even with my nose pinched (really). And it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards. 8 tic tacs at once did not get rid of it! But worst of all, within an hour I was yawning and drowsy. Unless you really like things that taste of a weird tea-flavored cough syrup and don't work, don't buy this! I don't know what to do with the other 11 bottles. big fail"
negative,20/7/21,"The package came with the label torn off and no cooking instructions. I know how I normally cook Couscous so tried 3/4 cup water to 1 cup couscous-brought to a boil and let sit, covered for 5min. It was mushy and tasteless.We have thrown out the rest of the container."
negative,19/7/21,So we cancelled the order.  It was cancelled without any problem.  That is a positive note...
negative,18/6/21,"I received the items in a timely manner. Upon receipt, I removed a pack to consume. The pop-tart was STALE and left an awful taste in my mouth."
negative,7/7/21,"Serveice delivery with the seller was excellent. The product was not. Will not order again. Bad taste. Iam not sure if it was old or that how it tastes. I throw it right away, i coudl not drink it."
negative,27/6/21,"A very bitter tasting coffee even when enhanced with cream and/or honey. Definately not my cup of coffee. Oh, did i say it was bitter?"
negative,21/7/21,This mix is very poorly packaged and breaks open easily during shipping. Nearly a full bag of my order was spilled in the shipping box. 3 bags out of 4 had come unsealed at the top. There were no tears in the packages.
negative,18/6/21,"I like Kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked.  I bought a bigger sized bag from Costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly. So I don't know why these were different.<br />Will never buy these chips from here again."
negative,7/7/21,"I really love Kettle brand chips, but these are rather disappointing. There is very little sour cream or onion flavor."
negative,30/6/21,"I agree with the other review, these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums. The chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt/vinegar combo. Unfortunately, every bag I received in that case was over cooked! They were very dark and only a few golden brown chips in each bag. They definitely need to improve that!"
negative,1/7/21,"I was really looking forward to trying these chips since I love cheese but I was SUPER DISAPPOINTED! I am a big fan of Kettle Chips but these tasted somewhat stale and almost plain! They are supposed to have a cheddar taste but you cannot taste any of that...it's annoying. I do not recommend this flavor..salt and vinegar and buffalo bleu are my favorite."
negative,24/8/21,"These are perhaps the worst chips that have ever gone into my mouth.<br /><br />For my entire life Sour Cream & Onion (and in this case ""& Chive"") chips were my favorite. Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.<br /><br />I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them. Hopefully they'll reassess the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips."
negative,21/7/21,"Kettle chips now look, feel and taste like Lays.  These chips used to be my favorite when it was crinkle cut and hefty.  Now, no longer my favorite."
negative,25/6/21,"These were nasty, they were so greasy and too rich for my blood, plus they lacked major flavor, no spicy jalapeno flavor at all.  I was so dissapointed in these chips, I am always hearing great things about these chips but I am telling you, yuck yuck yuck.  Give me pain chips any day.  Maybe there is a better kettle chip brand out there but I am staying clear from these chips. I wish I could give these zero stars if I could."
negative,13/9/21,"Being a salt-free product is why I purchased this, but the chips are quite greasy."
negative,18/6/21,"When originally produced in England  these we're the best chips I had ever tasted but unfortunately since they were bought out by the US conglomerate they now taste plain nasty. Hard rather than crispy, are much thinner than they used  to be and lacking any  flavour , a real shame."
negative,7/7/21,after opening numerous bags I found that none of the chips had any flavoring on them. completely plain and gross. how does this even happen?
negative,15/7/21,"I've bought these at the local supermarket and enjoyed them although they are so salty that a few leave my tongue and roof of my mouth burning.  Keeps you from eating too many!  Occasionally I get really stale items from Amazon.com and this was one.  Unedible.  Beware of the quality of food items on this website that are on special as they can be very close to due dates or in this case, not expired but stale and unedible just the same."
negative,11/7/21,I ORDERED KETTLE CHIPS IN THE FOLLOWING FLAVVORS<br />SALT & FRESH GROUND PEPPER<br />TUSCAN 3 CHEESE<br />N.Y. CHEDDAR AND HERS<br /><br />THEY ALL TASTED THE SAME TO ME.  IF THERE IS A VARIETY PACK SUGGEST U ORDER BEFORE ORDERING LARGE SIZE.<br /><br />I WISH I COULD RETURN THE UNOPENED BAGS.
negative,7/10/21,"I purchased these because of the low salt, and they were indeed low in salt. However, many, many of the chips in the bag were literally dripping in oil. I have never encountered this problem with other potato chip brands. It was very unappetizing, and who wants all that oil? I will never buy these again, and I would not recommend them to others."
negative,6/7/21,"If you are looking for STRONG S/V flavor these definitely aren't for you. Very mild in comparison to many others. I live in TX and I can tell you I've tried ALL S/V chips I can get ahold of. The best of the best are HEB (storebrand) and World Market. Bob's and Zapp's Aren't bad. From a chip standpoint they have typically great kettle crunch, but if you're looking for S/V flavor these have ""just a touch."""
negative,18/6/21,"I don't know if it was the case of chips we received or what, but everyone we allowed to sample the chips (in a buffet style setting) agreed that these were slightly on the salty side.<br />One person jokingly stated that these would be terrific for melting ice and snow, due to the amount of salt in these.<br /><br />We had ordered these with the expectations that these would be similar to the Lay's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips, but these Kettle brands outback bbq chips are the exact opposite.<br /><br />Sorry folks, we just had better expectations from these chips but they a little on the on the salty side.<br /><br />We are still looking forward to Amazon finally getting the Lay's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips in stock.<br />These got a 2 star, because the bbq powder they had used on these were flavorful enough to be unique."
negative,7/7/21,"These chips are greasy and taste burnt-there is grease in the bottom of the bag and the chips are saturated with it (especially at the bottom of the bag. Even if they are trans fat free, they need to be a lot less greasy."
negative,27/7/21,"Don't waste your money on any of the Kettle brand potato chips.  I bought a case of these, and a case of the cheddar and sour cream.  Both cases ended up in the garbage can."
negative,13/7/21,"Used to eat the Spicy Thai flavor all the time.  MSG makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was MSG free.  Now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them.  Instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage, a bunch more salt and MSG stuffed in under the label ""yeast extract"".  They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they did.<br /><br />The worst part though is that they taste horrible.  Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.<br /><br />What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.  It seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method.  Dont be fooled into paying a premium price for these chips as they are not a premium product anymore."
negative,13/9/21,"Terrible! I cannot believe this, I received this item and EVERY SINGLE BAG WAS OPENED BUT 4!!!! I'm stationed in Afghanistan and this was gonna be a snack for my team while going out on missions. I was so embarrassed when the bags were opened and spilt out all in the box, gross! And the box is filled with grease stains. Idk if it was from the airplane ride all the way here, but the box should have been more insulated and bubble wrap should have been used instead of paper. I'm very unhappy with stale crusty chips out the bag and us soldiers cannot enjoy now."
negative,7/9/21,"Kettle Branch Potato Chips New York Cheddar:  These are good if you like kettle fried potato chips that are waaaay salty, on the burnt side, and taste rancid, either because the cheese flavoring or the oil it was fried in was already old.  I want to like this brand of chips and try their new and other flavors every now and then.  But, after having tried all sorts of other brands of kettle cooked chips, these just don't hit the spot for me."
negative,17/4/21,"For those of you who, like me, had to order the Kettle Spicy Thai chips from Amazon because they are so hard to find locally, you will probably be aggrieved to know that the recipe has changed.  They are just like regular potatoe chips.  I paid for them but now my husband gets to eat them because he didn't like the spicy thai, but these are fine for him.<br /><br />Yuck!!!"
negative,10/3/21,"While I admit that the oversalted chip is addictive, I really think this one has gone too far. Skin literally peeled off my lips and inside my mouth after eating these. I am surprised that they are still on the market."
negative,17/4/21,"There is nothing too good or too bad about these chips. If you like plain potato chips, you'd like these. They are thicker than most brands, fresh out of box, very crunchy and not too salty (for me). One bag has a lot, I generally cannot finish it by myself. Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me. If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice, except salt, as the name says. I don't think I'll buy these again. The ""best by"" date on my bags are March 2011 and I ordered them at the end of October."
negative,21/1/21,"The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market.  However, Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used, with ginger  being the most important that is now missing.  Notice that they removed ""ginger with attitude"" from the bag.  Sadly, the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me.  They aren't that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non-existent.<br /><br />Here are the original and new ingredient listings:<br /><br />Original Ingredients<br />Select Potatoes, Safflower and/or Sunflower Oil, Honey Powder (Evaporated Cane Syrup, Honey)Salt, Garlic Powder, Jalapeno Pepper, Ground ginger, Onion Powder, Habanero Pepper, Dried Parsley, Citric Acid, Cilantro Extract, Ginger Oil, Cayenne Pepper, White Pepper, Lime Oil.<br /><br />New Ingredients<br />Potatoes, safflower and/or sunflower oil, sugar, dried cane syrup, salt, maltodextrin, yeast extract, spices, garlic powder, onion powder, dried parsley, jalapeno powder, citric acid, natural flavors, lime extract<br /><br />I'm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner,  Blue Diamond.  They might want to get rid of  ""Great Taste Naturally"" from their bags as I don't consider maltodextrin to be very natural.<br /><br />Great job Kettle!  Way to ruin a great thing!"
negative,30/1/21,"I Was sent 3 week past ""Fresh by date"" stock. Chips are noticeably not fresh in taste. Won't order again.<br /><br />EDIT: And just to add to the dangers of expired stock one of the bags had a rat hole in it, black marks on inside of hole very obviously rat. unfortunately I put a chip in my mouth before I saw the hole.<br /><br />Very bad form amazon."
negative,13/2/21,"and THAT is  the problem. I order these by the case of 12 - and when they are good, which is over half the time they are the BEST kettle chip, THE BEST! and then I get a case of the worse - the potatos are mealy and old so I just throw them out and order again, expensive BUT when they are made with good fresh potatos they are the best - the last case is what prompted me to write this - the potatos were weird - like they were almost sour as in going bad - and I even wrote the company that makes them - SO if you want the BEST kettle chip there is try these and if the ones you get are NOT the best try again!<br />I, myself am done ordering because it is creeping me out that they are using soured potatos and either not noticing or not caring."
negative,15/1/21,I am very disappointed with this product because I could not see how many calories it has at the time I ordered it. I received it and now I can see it has 60 calories per tablespoon. Granulated sugar has only 45 calories per tablespoon. How could Agave Nectar be better than sugar?
negative,6/3/21,"I was so excited thinking they had my favorite discontinued Kettle flavor, but was disappointed when I opened the box and found this substitution. I am keeping them but would not have ordered 15 bags of this flavor. It is a very good bbq chip but I could get this flavor at the grocery store. Why oh why do my favorite food items always get discontinued??? The one star is for the substitution. The country bbq is a 4 start chip, but not the chip I longed for."
negative,8/6/21,"I guess there's no telling what will tickle the palate.  I'm a huge Tabasco fan, and I love unconventional snacks.  But these don't taste to me even remotely like the wonderful sauce they're made from; I didn't find them to have much of a kick at all.  Practically bland, in fact.  Even with my strong aversion to wasting food, I had to throw out or give away most of the case.  Do yourself a favor and find a bag of these locally before taking a chance on 12."
negative,7/1/21,"""Yeast Extract"" is listed as an ingredient. Sounds harmless, right? Specifically, these chips contain autolyzed yeast extract, which is, on a chemical level, monosodium glutamate. It's just derived from a different source, but it has all the same toxic properties. Kettle still advertises their products as containing ""No MSG"" while they acknowledge that their chips are not safe for people with MSG sensitivities."
negative,17/4/21,"I did not like these potatoe chips. It's hot, and sweet, with an overwhelming taste of garlic. It's also a bit salty."
negative,10/3/21,"Unfortunately having ordered quite a few of these previously, I neglected to not look for the word: ""supreme"" in this offer and since I was then receiving free shipping had 4 delivered. We (that is my husband, guests and me)knew immediately that these were different from those previously enjoyed. BUT, currently Amazon featured the ""supreme"" babka and now I am awaiting to receive these. In the future, I will read more carefully."
negative,14/1/21,"I opened the can and immediately became concerned when I saw what looked like dried white crust, rather than fluffy frosting.  The package recommended stirring before use, so I gave that a try and under the crust was an indescribable gelatinous goo.  The best I can equate it to is a white version of the blue goop the mother serves for dinner in ""Better of Dead"" (no raisins in it though!).<br />I tried to stir it together and the end result was gelatinous goo with white crusties in it.  When lifting the knife to spread it long strings on goo trailed from my knife.<br />I opted for making my own frosting instead - very easy!  A little Sprectrum palm shortening, a lot of powdered sugar, a tiny splash of vanilla, a tiny bit of salt, and rice milk as needed for consistency, beat for 5 minutes, and I had the fluffy 'butter' cream frosting I thought I'd get from Cherrybrook.<br /><br />I wonder if our can was overheated in the store (whole foods) or something...<br />I've read positive reviews of their frosting mix, so maybe I'll try that next time."
negative,24/5/21,"I love Cherrybrook Kitchen and have tried almost all of their products.  I was excited to try the Ready to Spread frosting, as I do not usually keep the needed ingredients on hand for their box frosting.  I am not a picky eater, especially if the item contains sugar... but this was horrible!  The consistency is absolutely nothing like regular canned frosting.  It is not light and fluffy.  It is very gooey.  I cannot even imagine trying to spread it on a cake - it would rip it to pieces because it is so thick and gooey.  I did not even try it on a cake, because the taste and texture were so off-putting.  Seriously, do not waste your money!"
negative,14/10/21,"This product was such a disappointment!  As all the other reviewers said, it's a gluey, sticky texture more akin to Elmer's Glue than to an edible food product.  The flavor was sickening sweet.  I actually thought that the frosting had spoiled.  It was that bad!  Save yourself the time and $$ (I paid $4.99) and make your own frosting or go with another brand.  Cherrybrook cake and cookie mixes are so good.  It's hard to believe they even sell this."
negative,7/2/21,"I am glad I found this on the reduced rack for 99c. The taste was not bad but no way I could frost my cake. It stuck to the knife,ran down in strings,what a mess. I too thought I had gotten a bad batch.My GDs birthday cake looks like crap. Who would buy this mess. Horrible"
negative,29/3/21,"I recently purchased this on sale at my local grocery store... now I know why it was on sale!<br /><br />This is not a fluffy, creamy white frosting you'd expect to find when opening the jar. Now, I wasn't expecting it to be just like Betty Crocker, but it was pretty bad. Like others said, it is a gluey/tacky mess that would completely ruin a cake if you tried to spread it on.  It reminds me of taffy that hasn't quite hit the right stage in the candy making process.  The taste isn't that great either, and it's sickeningly sweet (even for frosting).  The only thing it might be used for is a frosting for cinnamon buns?  I still don't think it would be the right consistency..."
negative,17/4/21,"I can honestly say this is the worst frosting we have ever bought. It's kind of generous to call it frosting, it has more the consistency of rubber cement. And since we were in a time crunch, we didn't have the luxury of going back out to the store for a different frosting, so we forged ahead and decorated a cake with it. Horrible experience, bad enough to put us off cake decorating forever. It spread about as easily as chewing gum, stuck to everything it came in contact with, and got crumbs of the cake mixed up in it. On top of all this, it didn't even taste good. By the time we were done decorating, we knew there was no way we could feed this mess to our family. So we ended up going to the store anyway to buy a pre-made cake. Our cake, which took twice as long to decorate because this stuff is so gooey, was used as a centerpiece. A really ugly centerpiece, that cracked and peeled as the frosting dried."

negative,21/4/21,"I am a preschool teacher and do a G is for Gingerbread unit every January. I was on vacation during Christmas and when I got back not a gingerbread kit was to be found. Which is odd. I needed one for my preschool class and needed it in less then a week. I looked everywhere and could not find ont. So I had one overnighted from Amazon on NYE and it came yesterday. I pick this one because of the Rudolph theme. The gingerbread itself came broken. Like unable to use would need a glue gun to get it to work broken. It's non returnable. I called Amazon, they were nice enough to order me a second one since I spend a ton of money each year with them. This one also came broken. I order A LOT from Amazon and things do not come broken. I think only one time have I had returned something because it was broken in 100's of orders. But two of the same thing in a row?! I think it's the kit itself and nothing to do with how it was shipped. I will say most come UPS and overnight comes Fed Ed. But it's bubble wrapped very well. I think the gingerbread isn't good and cracks in shipping and breaks off. The rest of the kit is very cute. The first kit the candies had spilled out and where a mess in the box. But the second kit while the gingerbread was all broken up again the candies were all in their bags. Too bad. But I would try something else, stay away from this one."

Not happy at all!!!"
negative,17/4/21,"This tea carries the flavor one would expect from the smell: terrible.  It invigorates like a puncture wound, and the only revival is that, after drinking, you discover that you are still alive.<br /><br />Well, one tea bag was enough for me.

After arriving home from the grocery, I immediately started the kettle to enjoy a cup while prepping dinner.  Between sorting, washing, and chopping items, the hot water was added to the bag to steep.  Preparation continued, until a distinctly off odor hit me.  I thought one of my ingredients must be rancid!  I hunted around for almost four minutes before I realized it was the tea.  Even after cleaning up, and airing out the kitchen, my roommate later came in and asked about the smell.  Save your money to purchase ANY other Twinings product."

negative,25/4/21,The individual Pocky sticks are not separately packaged and melt and stick together while being shipped.
negative,1/4/21,"This product must qualify for some sort of deceptive packaging award. The box only contains 5 bars and the wrappers are smaller than normal, so at least 50% of the interior of the box is air. Then when you unwrap the bar you find they are only about 60% the length of a ""normal"" snack bar. The rest of it is empty air inside the wrapper. If they were to not include wrappers those 5 bars would occupy less than 25% of the space inside the box.<br /><br />As far as taste goes they are so-so. On the dry side with a hint of berry flavor. Celiacs, who are used to inferior products, won't be disappointed in the taste of this one.<br /><br />I've also had their cookies and they suffer from the same sort of deceptive packaging. The picture on the side of the box shows what most of us would consider a normal sized cookie. But when you open the box you find that it mostly contains a plastic tray holding cookies about the size of a quarter.<br /><br />I really want to like this company. They seem to be trying hard and coming out with new products and keeping allergens out of the production process. That is why I've continued to try their products. I bought their granola many times, always wanting to like it, but it is some of the worst food I've ever had. The ""clusters"" are hard as the partially popped kernels at the bottom of your bag of popcorn and more fitting for gerbils than people.<br /><br />All in all I would not recommend Enjoy Life foods."
negative,30/6/21,"I have recently stopped eating a number of allergens (dairy, soy, nuts) and these were one of the few snacks which fit into my dietary restrictions.  Unfortunately, these were pretty gross - miserable texture and more cardboard flavored than berry.  I threw them away.  I would recommend the cocoa ones as they are much tastier and also allergen free."
negative,1/3/21,"My daughter had extensive food allergies as an infant/toddler and we bought these bars consistently.  She still has the nut and egg allergy so I like that I can trust the manufacturer and know the food is safe.  Unfortnately the last few times we have purchased the bars (all varieties) they have been hard as a rock and my daughter won't eat them.  I have tried them myself and thought I might break a tooth. I had them on subscribe and save; which I have now cancelled and have several boxes which no one in my family will eat.  I agree with a previous post. I want to love these bars and I love everything the company stands for (and actually really like their cookies), but something has changed with these bars and they are just not even appetizing.  I hope they address the issue and I will certainly try them again if they do something to enhance the taste and address the issue with the texture. A total bummer -  they were better in the past but something changed with the taste, along with their new packaging!!"
negative,29/1/21,"Refer to the picture I posted above.  The bar is half the size you think it is going to be...It is literally a two-bite bar.  Very deceptive advertising.  That and the fact that they are ridiculously expensive is the reason for the one star.  My 10 year old son ate one and didn't like them. I ate one and agreed as did my husband.  Couldn't give it away!  Everyone has different tastes but these are no tasty treat as far as I'm concerned."

Then scoop it up and put it in your mouth.<br /><br />That's how disgusting this bar is.<br /><br />I have no idea how and who is rating this as flavorful, IT HAS NONE. I've done nutritional coaching for 30 years and watched healthy foods progress from painfully bad to barely edible to excellent.<br /><br />This neanderthal-era gluten free bar is so bad I want to go to my local grocery store, take all the boxes off off the shelf and hide them in a different part of the store (perhaps, if there's a trash compactor?) just to protect people from the experience my daughter had with this product.<br /><br />Save your money for these ridiculously expensive and spend it on anything else.<br /><br />""Enjoy Life"" bars?

However, tonight after I'd given him half the jar I thought I would try some since it was a new flavor and I realized that there were little pieces or soft shredded plastic in it. I was appalled!  As this is my first child and I don't have any experience with this kind of thing, I called poison control. They said he would be ok and once I knew he was fine, I got really angry. I looked it up online and found that Earth's Best has actually known about the plastic for some time but are still selling it. Don't buy Earth's Best! Really disappointing."

When I tried it I understood why, I wouldn't eat it myself either... it tastes nasty.... my poor baby.... immediately I made her a homemade potato, zucchini, & asparagus puree and she loved it. I wouldn't recommend this flavor!"
negative,21/4/21,"This is my daughter's  most favorite baby food by far.  This is the only ones she'll eat and rarely will eat the other kinds.  However, the taste is very bland, for me as an adult at least. After you put the unfinished portion in the fridge, it may become sort of watery at which point I throw it out. It is unique from the others in the combination of vegetables it has, especially zucchini.<br />I had to update my review today, because I saw little pieces of thin stretchy plastic in two jars of this baby food.  PLASTIC IN BABY FOOD? I notified Earth's Best about it and will be sending them these pieces of plastic for testing, but I am not giving my baby this food any more, even though she likes it, that's it for us."

The first time I went to use it, the liquid was a dark color...almost black..and I had to throw out the latte I was trying to sweeten.  All the manufacturer's other liquid products are clear, and, in fact, this is titled ""clear liquid"".  It must have been outdated/spoiled. I had already thrown the packing out, so don't know how it was dated.  I tried calling the Amazon supplier, but the call rolled into voice mail.

If I wanted a cheap product that I knew was low quality and from China then I would have bought them directly from their site at $7 for 38 of them!!! However, from the picture these looked well made. The picture is very deceiving and so is the description. They show 16 same-colored lollipops...mine came in a variety of colors. They also gave dimentions that the lollipops were 6""x2"". I noticed they looked a bit small and when I measured they didn't even come to 5"" long, not any of them...even though they're all differnet lengths.  This was very disappointing since I planned to stand them up in a vase of lemon drops. Overall, I'm very disappointed in this product and the seller for not being honest about the product they're providing to consumers."

I really should have thought twice about buying it again, but I wanted to give Pillsbury the benefit of the doubt.  Boy was I wrong in doing that.  Both times that I used it, the frosting pretty much 'sagged' off of the cake!  My cakes were definitely cooled.  I had even put the latest one in the freezer to slice into layers.  After thawing it in the fridge, I began to ice it.  Sure enough after putting the frosting on it just started to slide off of the cake (again)!  This product needs to either be marketed as cupcake frosting, the recipe needs tweaked, or it needs to be pulled off of the shelves all together.  Shame on me for trying it a second time!"

Those were the days of the big 'Redskin' type peanut surrounded with a glaze of honey sweetness punctuated with a salty tang I remember so well. These nuts I now have in the palm of my hand are not reminiscent of ""Beer Nuts"" in any way. Yes, there is a discernible salty taste but the sweetness is more to me imagined than real. Plus, these nuts are simply the common inexpensive 'Spanish peanuts'. In short, I would just ask ""Beer Nuts"" ... 'What happened?'"

negative,26/6/21,"The current product, ""Certified Organic Raw Cacao Powder from Ecuador, sold by SAAQIN"", is of terrible quality.

Alive and Aware is delicious; Organic Herbal Essence is not. Another warning: After receiving the 5lb bag of Organic Herbal Essence and hating it, I ordered ""Alive and Aware Certified Organic Raw Cacao Powder from Ecuador - 2 Pounds"", shipped by Halaleveryday. I thought for sure I'd get Alive and Aware, given it's in the product title, but Halaleveryday actually shipped me ""Organic Herbal Essence"". Grr."
negative,25/5/21,"As another reviewer stated, many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder- from alive and aware, ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder. That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed.<br />I am really confused/irritated how my review for ""alive and aware raw cacao"" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can't they just say ""out of stock"" or ""currently unavailable"" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around?<br />Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao.<br />I did recently order alive and aware's raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand.<br />Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the ""brands"" and ""vendors"" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said ""alive and aware"" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.<br /><br />For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I'm going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)<br /><br />I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.<br /><br />Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!!<br />I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food ""of the Gods"" (theobroma) as they say :)<br />My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!!<br />Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw.<br />Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!  PEACE be with You!"
negative,7/9/21,"Ya know, when you're on a gluten-free diet, you YEARN for those forbidden treats - like licorice! (and malted milk!) Realizing that true licorice on this challenging diet is in the past and not likely to ever be repeated in the near future, we need to alter our expectations for this treat.<br /><br />I had tried this company's raspberry laces and strawberry laces - pretty good, although not easy to chew (think bubblegum).  Not REAL licorice you understand, but pretty doggone good as an alternative.<br /><br />So I thought I try these too - how bad could they be?  I found them pleasant to chew - not tough at all.  But the taste?  Nasty and medicinal cough syrup with an aftertaste that is truly awful.<br /><br />So I'm stuck with 11 packs.<br /><br />See if you can't find a source where you can buy just ONE pack to try out.  Your tastes may be different than mine, and you might enjoy them."
negative,15/7/21,"I bought this 4 pack to have some inexpensive caviar to use for garnish over the holidays. The other night I decided to go ahead and use one for some dip. It was so bad I couldn't believe it. It wasn't spoiled, it just had an odd flavor with a terrible aftertaste. It didn't even taste like caviar. I threw the jar away."
negative,3/6/21,"I would never have ordered this had I known I was only going to be sent 12, and one of them was open and leaking powdered spice out. I complained to Amazon, and I know from experience that they always have awesome customer service. Since I just got my package today and just opened it now, I have to wait a bit to hear back from them on this issue...will keep you updated. I just wanted you guys to know that even though it states 144 packets, it is NOT. Must be a misprint? Double check with Amazon before you order this. What sounds like an awesome deal is a meh deal if you are getting only 12 of them."
negative,27/9/21,"i found this product doing a search for ""edible gold leaf."" i decided to purchase after reading rave reviews about food items that were created using it. HOWEVER.. it is clearly marked ""NOT to be consumed"" and ""for decorative use only."" so this is a misleading product."
negative,19/6/21,"Me and my wife have tried a wide range of the Hormel compleats, and this is by far the worst tasting one of the bunch. I could complain about the lack of ""Chicken"" but the horrid taste even<br />overshadows that minor drawback. I know its a cheap meal,  but I do expect something at least a little edible.  If you are looking to the Compleats then go with something at least worth you money, pick up the far superior tasting Spaghetti or Turkey dinners, and feed this thing to the family dog."
negative,25/5/21,"This is a starchy soup rather than the meal portrayed on the outside.  There is very little taste and very little chicken.  It is mostly rice in a weak chicken stock thickened with potato and corn starch.<br /><br />It is not repulsively bad, if you want a light, convenient snack.<br /><br />The Chef Boyardee microwavable meals are tastier and more substantial, and also more convenient because you just have to pull off the lid, which comes away easily.  With these Hormel Compleats, you have to pierce the top first, and then peel it off afterwards, which is not so easy, especially as it is hot."
negative,7/9/21,"the taste isn't good, at least isn't good for Japanese and Chinese.<br />Its taste is basically sort of American Japanese taste.<br />Plus the price isn't competitive.<br /><br />I'd suggest Asians never buy it."
negative,3/8/21,"I read the reviews for this product and had high hopes for a healthy, decent tasting cup of noodles. Needless to say I found this not to be true. First, the consistency is gross and second, the taste is awful. Maybe I am just not accustomed to eating crap. Think twice before ordering this product. I wish I did."
negative,5/9/21,"I have purchased locally many other flavors of Da Vinci syrups, and ordered blueberry online to try it, because it isnt available locally- and I love blueberry! Well, this was a disappointment to me- very very sugary sweet with little blueberry flavor; not to mention I paid 4x what I would pay locally.<br />#very disappointed"
negative,25/5/21,"I tried the Martha White Turtle Fudge Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe and these are the worst cookies I have ever made. Either there is someone on the staff of Martha White who has a lopsided sense of humor OR their taste buds have taken a permanent vacation. I wasted my time, a lot of money on chocolate and pecans,and my effort.Martha White either needs to tweek this recipe or take it off the website so no other unsuspecting housewife will waste her money and time on these worthless cookies. My husband picked up one on his way through the kitchen and within two seconds he came back in and threw it in the garbage."

negative,11/9/21,"We enjoy A Taste of Tai's Peanut Noodles... they rock.  That peanutty flavor...mmm... so we decided to try these... um, Ginger, not so much. Nothing really distinguishes these from any other noodle flavor, and the ginger is a bit overpowering.<br /><br />Take this review in stride though, if you're a Ginger lover (and I'm not talking Gilligan's Island here), then these may be right up your alley.  Just a bit outside for me, though (if I may mix my metaphors)."
negative,13/7/21,"I had recently tried a similar product from Trader Joe's and, not having a TJ's around me presently, I decided to try this more readily-available variation.  I didn't really like this thing too much.  For starters, there is too much packaging for my liking.  Too many things to throw away.  And I agree with a previous reviewer that they're kind of big cartons for how much they hold.  Inside the container are 4 packages - one for noodles, and three for various seasonings.  Then you have to add water.  They give you a fill line, but it's kind of awkward.  Then microwave for 3 minutes.  Then stir, then microwave again for one minute.  The one from Trader Joe's only has two packets - one for noodles, one for sauce - and no water involved.  Just microwave for 2 minutes and you're done.  And those are a lot tastier.  I didn't like the texture of this thing (everything clumped together too much) and it really didn't have much taste, especially considering the three different packets of seasoning I put in.  Time to try a couple of the other brands of these things..."
negative,22/7/21,I bought these for my son to take to work for lunch. Apparently his co-workers found the smell so offensive they asked him not to eat it at work again. Maybe it was a bad batch...
negative,22/6/21,"I had high hopes when I ordered this tea, as years ago in San Francisco I used to buy a lovely rose black in Chinatown which was my favorite tea ever. Unfortunately, this blend lacks body and is very high in caffeine. I prefer the opposite, a full-bodied tea I can brew strong without sending my blood pressure through the roof.  But for someone who wants a light tasting tea with a powerful caffeine punch, this might be a good choice."
negative,28/7/21,"I was giving my shihtzu the Fromm Adult Gold dog food. She didn't seem to want to eat it though so I thought I would try something different. I found the Harmony Farms and thought I'd give it a try. She actually liked it. It's cheaper then the other food and it seemed to contain really healthy ingredients. I couldn't believe how she gobbled this up. BUT after having her on this for a week she developed a rash on her stomach. Took her off and the rash went away completely in 2 days. Her hair also wasn't as soft. This kibble did not do well for her."
negative,13/10/21,I read the reviews on this and thought id get some for my dog and pup.<br />They will not touch it. Even if I mix it with home cooked food.<br /><br />They like the dollar store dog food better than this.<br /><br />Amazon let me down on even allowing this dog food to be sold under their name.
negative,19/2/21,I bought these and tried each flavor. I could not even finish any bag but the barbecue. I really liked the barbecue but all the other flavors were gross. And the texture is really like fingernails on a chalk board to me. HOw is this the #1 best-selling item? Amazed. Anywho to each his own! Godbless and enjoy. But if you are like me and enjoy barbecue just get the barbecue kind!
negative,14/12/20,"Very tasty chips( ORIGINAL AND OTHER FLAVORS ),but ones with salt flavor way too salty.Not sure who likes so much salt in chips.."
negative,14/12/20,"I hate to type this, because there are so many people that really enjoy this product, but take a look at the ingredients in this so-called ""all-natural"" product. I have the cheddar cheese flavor right in front of me, so that is the only flavor I can vouch for right now.  About halfway down the list of ingredients you'll see ""yeast extract."" Unfortunately, this is the new MSG.  Many people are still unaware of this fact and ""natural"" food companies are taking advantage.  It is a chemical flavor enhancer whose potential side effects are very scary.  Google ""MSG yeast extract"" for yourself, or check out [...]."
negative,19/2/21,"These are to potato chips as Pringles are to chips; as instant coffee is to brewed coffee; and Stephen Baldwin is to Alec Baldwin - same family but scant resemblance.  So I'd buy a single, small package at your grocers and try them out.  Not for everyone, and certainly not for my family which includes two teenage boys.  Even they take a pass on these unless they are truly desperate.  Crispness is OK.  Even mouth feel is good, but there is a lingering (not good) taste - again, kind of like Pringles.  PS: the flavors are OK but definitely taste like they were made at that flavor factory along the Jersey Turnpike."
negative,10/1/21,"Purchased the 0.8oz bag (Seemed the same size as the other bags when purchased), but didn't realize it was 0.8 ounces as compared to other bags.  Just be aware - might be perfect for some, but not for us.  Having a bag with 10 potato chips in it doesn't cut it for me.  Might be perfect for kids - but just a heads up."
negative,26/3/21,"I don't know why everyone loves these chips. They are healthy but taste disgusting. Only the original flavor tasted good, so getting the variety pack was a very bad idea. I would not buy this again and would rather go with baked chips than these. Pirate's Booty makes popped chips that are way better."
negative,24/3/21,"Despite the plethora of positive product reviews for these snacks, I see no reason to buy them again. Read those positive reviews and compare the content in some of them to the guidelines of a non-profit consumer organization for reviews. They contain a lot of ""Wow!"" with little specifics that would have been included by a true believer. Weigh the others as you will, but the proof is still in the pudding.<br /><br />The texture is their best asset (if you like that sort of texture); that's about it for me. They appear to be an extruded potato product (many of those out there) with various seasonings that do not impress me, either. The most basic of them puts 160mg of sodium into the TINY .8oz package. If you were a deer, you might eat them for that alone. The fat is reduced, that much is true. But...<br /><br />Unless you are ready to trade fat for sodium, it's no deal. But wait... baked kettle chips, in a 1oz serving, up the fat to... 3G, the same as the .8 of the basic flavor. You got .2OZ free on that one. The baked kettles possess 135mg sodium, vs. 160. These chips give you 1G fiber in .8 vs. 2 in 1oz of baked kettles. This product loses again.<br /><br />The only place you might 'gain' is in carbs 21 for the kettle chips, 15 for these, but remember... you have .2oz extra in the kettle's nutrition info... just about a wash.<br /><br />And then, topping it all - the cost... $0.92 an oz vs $0.44 for baked kettles in subscription. Wow. These wonderful snacks cost $14.72 per pound, packed as they are. The prices will fluctuate... but think about the things you can buy for that money instead. These are microscopic bags (that does not help the environment, either - portion control aside) with product largely deriving its kick from sodium and cheap spices.<br /><br />The most positive thing I can say is the product is packed very well. Lots of air in the bags to protect the chips, and they will mostly arrive intact in their tiny portions in tiny bags. You won't have many crumbs in the bottoms of these little bags, so that is a good thing.<br /><br />But... bottom line... expensive junk ""health food"". ""Wow!""."
negative,24/2/21,"I decided to give these a try since one of my good friends and her son raved about how good they were...Bad idea!  I almost ordered two since they were such a good price, I am so glad I didn't!  We don't care of these AT ALL!  The concept is nice, chips that are crunchy and better for you than most, BUT they taste funny!  They have a funny aftertaste and are not that enjoyable.  We have been slowly (and I mean very slowly) making our way through the 24 the box brought (we still have 19 left and we received them over two weeks ago) so they are not so horrible that you can't eat them, its just like forcing us to eat them so we don't have to throw them all away!  If you haven't had them before, I suggest trying them before committing to 24 bags of various yucky flavors!"
negative,19/2/21,"I love shrimp chips and I love healthier alternatives as well so I thought these would be a match made in heaven. Not so much. The flavors were too strong most of the time (I am a huge fan of pepper but even I had a hard time enjoying the salt & pepper flavor and the salt and vinegar made me shudder with each bite because of how strong the vinegar flavor is -- and this is from someone who currently lives in the UK and enjoys all types of vinegar crisps here) and too bleh in others. The only flavors that my husband and I both liked were the bbq and sour cream and onion and we didn't enjoy them enough to want to buy these again.<br /><br />I wish these were as good as all the hoopla regarding them said but we still have 15 bags of these in our cabinet four months later uneaten so needless to say, I will be giving these away and avoiding them from now on."
negative,14/12/20,I bought those chips after reading good reviews but I was very disappointed with the taste. It was nothing like what I expected (granted that I expected good old kettle cooked potato chips). I bought the 6-flavor variety pack and there were many flavors I did not care for. It was worth trying them but I am not going to purchase them again in the future.
negative,19/10/21,the best flavor in this box is the salt and pepper and the bbq flavor.  all the other flavor was just so-so
negative,18/5/21,"I was at a charity fund raising event where they were handing these out. They seemed pretty tasty, so I bought a couple bags at Target. The ones I bought (Barbeque and Salt and Vinegar) were AWFUL! I ended up throwing away most of them, neither I nor anyone else who tried them could choke them down. The ones they were handing out as samples were clearly very different from what they are selling. Don't waste your money."
negative,19/2/21,"The only flavor we could stand was the barbecue (which was the reason we purchased them in the first place)!  I had to give the others away!!!  I won't be buying this again for lunches although the size/packaging was great.  I just wish the other flavors tasted better (plain, salt, pepper, etc., weren't really kid-friendly)."
negative,14/12/20,"These chips taste so dry and gross, I would rather eat carrots or something than these. They just didn't satisfy the salty craving and weren't worth the calories."
negative,1/6/21,"I bought this because I had been seeing this pod in magazines and other places. I thought it would be a great addition to my fridge to save money on cilantro. However, this is very poorly designed. I could not open it whats-or-ever, even after searching through reviews after reviews. Finally, my genius boyfriend found the solution! Basically, you will need to open it from the BOTTOM. You will need to squeeze the two sides next to the cap in order to open it. You will have to be careful when you are opening or closing it while there's water in the pot. If any one who is reading this still having problem opening it. Let me know. I'll try to explain it better there. But anyway, this is a pretty useless product for its productivity, but a bit more useful if you are too lazy to make your own, and wants a prettier fridge. You can make you own with a cup (or any container) filled with a bit of water and wrapped in plastic bag with the herb....(so unless you have money to waste, don't buy this useless pot)."
negative,1/4/21,"I have had the herb pods for about 6 months.  They are a great concept, but have a poor design. The plastic cover is very hard to take off and snap back on.  I'm  constantly afraid that I'm going to break it.  The pods do keep herbs fresh for several weeks in the fridge as long as you replace the water.  Unfortunately I don't use them half of the time I buys herbs because they are more trouble than they are worth."
negative,15/4/21,"With no clear instructions on how to open and close the unit, the first few times are an act of frustration.  When I finally realized that if I grip with my thumb and forefinger over the clear plastic shield, about one third from it's bottom and squeeze the sides, the bottom lip pops out nicely.<br />I will agree that this size is too small for most popular herbs like parsley, basil ect.  The company does now make a larger unit and it looks like it is more user friendly.<br />All in all I like it, I took away one star for the lack of instructions.<br /><br />3/2012: After a few months I have thrown this thing away.  It became increasingly harder to open and the size was just too small for the herbs I use most.  I have seen some newer, larger units that don't have the issue with opening it like this one has...I'm going to order one of these.<br /><br />I no longer recommend this unit and have lowered it to 2 stars."
negative,19/5/21,"Despite reading the reviews of others on how hard this was to open, I was confident I knew the secret so would be fine. Not so. No matter what I did, couldn't pop off the clear plastic lid. Instructions showed the bottom part screwing off, didn't. Husband couldn't even do it and he opens everything for me. He finally got it open, only held about half of the aspargus which is what I wanted it for so tossed it in the garbage and then bought one from Progresso that we both can open. Note to self, pay MORE attention to what people are saying."
negative,19/2/21,"Even with the tips shared on how to open it, it's still pretty difficult to open.  I guess I have weak hands. My husband usually has to open it for me, and even he doesn't do it with ease.  I would recommend getting the larger Prepara herb savor instead of the pod.  It's much easier to open and can hold more.  I could hardly fit any cilantro in the pod (considering that the grocery sells them in such large bunches and I only use half)."
negative,14/12/20,"Saw this on Oprah's favorite things and thought it would make a great little Christmas gift for my friends that love cooking as much as I do. Since they come in packages of three, I kept one and gave two away. I couldn't open mine to clean it, so my husband had to open it and he had a hard time. I thought it was just too tight from the factory. My basil looked great after ten days. But when I went to use the basil, I could not open the pod. Husband not home...neighbor not home...dog missing thumbs. I tried lightly rapping it against the counter edge and the seam cracked right down the middle. (Okay, maybe a little harder than 'lightly,' I was pretty frustrated.) Luckily I had emptied the water, so I only had a small mess to clean up. The pod went into the garbage...forcefully. I checked with my friends. Friend #1 had the same problem and her pod is now a rooting capsule for plant clippings because she had to throw away the clear cover...it also broke when she squeezed the pod to try to open it. Friend #2 has now been warned. There were no special tips included on how to open the pod and judging from comments I've read, we're not the only ones who have had this problem. I think this was designed by the same guy that invented the  security wrapping/tape on music CDs! I've gone back to my old method...a wide-mouth mayo jar with pretty hair band holdingdown a circle of fabric...it works!"
negative,28/7/21,"I've been told that the refrigerator of the future will have herb/vegetable/salad bins inside to grow vegetables and I thought the Prepara Herb Savor Pod looked like the perfect precursor. Wrong. The detachable bottom comes loose continually and leaks water everywhere. Similarly, the plastic plug at the back does NOT hold. A good idea, a nice-looking product, but poorly executed. Refrain from purchasing -- plastic bags are MUCH, much better."
negative,29/6/21,"The Prepara Herb Savor Pod is advertised holding asparagus. That was why I purchased it, thinking it would be good for keeping asparagus fresh. In reality the pod will hold very few spears and they would need to be quite thin and short.  The ad is misleading. I'll keep it for storing herbs, but asparagus is out of the question."
negative,15/10/21,"After reading a previous review I carefully inspected the cans when they arrived. The cans were immaculate and very clean so I felt relieved. After cooling in the fridge I ate the first can. The fruit was very mushy and not attractive to look at and frankly a disapointment but did not taste rotten per say. Only minutes later though my mouth felt like acid was eating at it and was very painful for hours even after washing out my mouth. I eat much canned and fresh fruit and this was a first for me. Only days later my teeth and gums were infected and I had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad. He found infection and I had to undergo a treatment of antibiotics and painkillers before I was finally ok again after about 2 weeks. SHEESH! Needless to say I threw out the remaining cans of fruit! The problem must be at the source as the cans and packaging were 1st rate and shining clean. Quality control must really suck. I'm all for natural but great care must be taken so contamination is avoided. This is a foreign product and their health standards may be lacking there. I would stay far away from this stuff if you value your health!"
negative,20/7/21,"EDIT:  I just noticed each bag is only 1.76 pounds, not 2.2.  My review is not 2 stars instead of three.<br /><br />First off, as you can probably guess by the pictures, these are sour gummies.  That isn't said in the description.  Also, each one is about 2 to 2 1/2 inches in length and 1/2 inch wide.<br /><br />Texture and flavor:  The came to me soft and with the same texture as most gummies such as peach rings.  The sourness is average, not overwhelming but not too little.  Where I took off the 2 stars was the flavor (most important part).  As I chewed them, a few different flavors hit my tongue, none of which tasted that great.  I couldn't make out any of them in-particular (not good at that anyways) but the combination was just plain strange.<br /><br />I could see myself getting through one bag but will probably give the other 3 away to nephews/niece.  After all, they will eat anything sugar coated right?"
negative,12/10/21,I purchased this item because it was cheaper than other olive juices. i was looking for a good quality olive juice for martinis. i was pretty disappointed. the juice is very strong. i followed the instructions and put the ratio on the bottle into the shaker and made a martini. the ratio was 2 part vodka to 1 part olive juice. it was way too salty. the olive juice was over powering. i made a decent dirty martini with 2 parts vodka 1/4 part olive juice. i would not recommend this item.

negative,2/7/21,"Sea salt is more easily administered with a salt mill. This is just a salt shaker that delivers uncontrollable amounts of sea salt and anti-caking agent into your food, and no iodide. The anti-caking agent isn't event that effective, so the salt either comes out in clumps or gets stuck at the exit. Stay away!"
negative,11/3/21,"This candy tasted like sugar without much rose flavor at all.<br /><br />I ended up throwing most of it out because I don't like so much sugar....

negative,2/2/20,"If your newborn cries inconsolably, you should try a lactose-free formula right away even though they're so expensive. However, the ingredients may not look so good.  It's important to shop around if you're going to use a lactose-free formula. Lactose-free formulas always are the most expensive and this one is loaded with processed corn syrup solids.<br /><br />From Wikipedia: ""Baby colic (also known as infant colic, three-month colic, infantile colic and colic) is a condition in which an otherwise healthy baby cries or screams frequently and for extended periods without any discernible reason."" You'll know it if it happens to your baby, and it's awful to not be able to do anything to immediately relieve your baby.  It contains DHA, ARA and iron, but all baby formulas do because it is required by law.<br /><br />Lactose-free formula is expensive is because it goes through a very specialized and difficult manufacturing process, I'm told by the company's public relations representative.  So much food in the U.S. is prepared with corn syrup solids, so that shouldn't be a worry, I'm told.  Ok, but I notice the obesity rate is high."
negative,23/5/20,"The description of this product is disceptive.  This product was represented as a powder, but it is not a powder, it's a granule.  It is nothing more than shredded coconut and doesn't even dissolve in a high speed commercial blender.<br /><br />Unless you are using this product to manufacture a dark chocolate-coated coconut patty, to me it is useless.  My intention was to use it as an additive in a healthy shake.  It ended up ruining the shake as I had to resort to chewing the undissolved, tasteless coconut pieces rather than drinking the shake.<br /><br />Additionally, the way the product was packaged, there was no protective cardboard preventing the slashing the top package when the box was opened.<br /><br />If I could have rated this product zero stars, I would have. The only redeeming quality was that it was rather inexpensive.  I gave one package away for FREE to a patient who loves coconut and she gave it back to me two days later complaining that it was terrible!"
negative,22/11/20,"I bought this same brand from an online Indian grocery store that usually has excellent products.  I was able to turn it into cream/butter, using my super blender and adding some water, but it barely had any flavor.  I usually buy the Chao Kah brand of coconut cream (which is quite tasty and flavorful) and read another review for a different product for making your own coconut cream.  My complaint is not the shreds or texture.  Mine was just virtually tasteless."
negative,30/3/20,"I bought this for our young son and was disappointed in several aspects of this dispenser:<br /><br />(1) It's made of cheap plastic and arrived w/ the globe scratched and cracked.<br /><br />(2) The top doesn't screw on--it just pops off w/ very little exertion.<br /><br />(3) Part of the appeal for me was that this dispenser is coin-operated.  What the description on Amazon doesn't tell you, however, is that a coin is not necessary to dispense the candy.  Furthermore, when the crank is just barely turned, the candy (usually two pieces) flies out so quickly that some goes on the floor w/o your hand there to catch it.  A young child is often not coordinated enough to turn the crank and put his hand out to catch the candy.<br /><br />(4) The dispenser only came w/ enough candy to just fill the bottom of the globe.<br /><br />(5) It is very much over-priced at $29.99."

negative,4/7/21,"Ugh....I tried this as a replacement for the Coconut Water with Pineapple that was available before in the automatic ship program.  This stuff is awful.  It's got added sugar, which is not needed at all and actually makes the drink taste pretty gross.  Never getting this stuff again.  (And I do love coconut water, in general, as it is a fantastic hydrator and tastier than Gatorade...well, usually.  Not this stuff.)"
negative,5/2/20,"Almost gagged at first taste. I have used other coconut based products (water, milk, cooking oil, etc) and this is the first time I have been disappointed. My teenage kids hated it.

The added cane juice is superfluous to the natural sweetness of coconut water and pineapple juice.  It makes the water taste 'thicker' and not so healthy.<br /><br />I wish these brands can just stick to the name of the drinks in their ingredients! (i.e. coconut water and pineapple juice! - no more!)"
negative,2/2/20,"I love coconut and pineapple, but I was not wild about the ONE Coconut Water with a Splash of Pineapple. It wasn't BAD ... it had a mildly coconutty (though not sweet) flavor, but it just wasn't anything special. It was rather bland, and I had a hard time finishing it as it started to warm up. Since I'm not a competitive athlete and don't have any great need to replenish my electrolytes, I'd rather just drink water."
negative,22/11/20,"This product is billed as an all natural anti-oxident and electrolyte replacing beverage.  Sort of like all-natural Gatorade with anti-oxidents.<br /><br />Like a sports beverage, it too is also kinda bland.  I love some of the Gatorade flavors, some not so much.  This drink falls into the not so much category for me.<br /><br />It is sorta sweet, sorta pineapple-y, and also sorta bland.  My wife commented that it has a slippery feel in her mouth, like the glass had soap in it still.  I didn't think it was that bad but the drink really didn't appeal to me.<br /><br />In the end, yes, this drink is probably much better for you than a glass of apple juice and definitely better than some sugar infused punch.  But as a sports drink, I think I'll stick with plain old gatorade; it's cheaper and contains fewer calories per serving.<br /><br />If going the all natural route with your juices/drinks is of the utmost importance this may be something to consider and bump this review to 3 stars."
negative,1/3/20,"I received a single 8.5 once container of ONE Coconut water with a splash of Pineapple as part of the Amazon Vine program for review.<br /><br />It would have been nice if it had come with a straw, especially considering the price of the product. Now as to the ""Splash of Pineapple"", well it must not have been a very big splash, because I never did taste any pineapple. So what did I taste? It is hard to describe. It doesn't taste like coconut or cane sugar or any ""Natural Fruit flavor"".<br /><br />To be honest, it tastes like water,...sort of. Like water with an odd, undefinable extra flavor. It's not a bad flavor or a good flavor, it's just Meh! flavor. I don't care how ""healthy"" this drink is supposed to be, for it's price, it should have a better flavor, or just have a flavor.<br /><br />And as a ""thirst quencher"", it doesn't equal up to Gatorade or even a Lemonade. I feel a glass of tap water would do just as good as job to quench your thirst."
negative,23/11/20,"Coconut water with a hint of pineapple, shipped to the US from Indonesia, packaged in (usually) non-recyclable, disposable containers, and catering to the... sports drink market (""good source of electrolytes"")?<br /><br />I took a  8.5 ounce container and poured 6 servings, for 4 teenagers and 2 adults.  First impression?  The teens (serious athletes) were not told what the drink was, but I did mention that it was being marketed as a potential sports drink.<br /><br />The result?  No negative votes, but no one would choose it over existing drinks.  Everyone recognized the pineapple flavor instantly.  ""It leaves a strange feeling in my mouth,"" one teen said.  This was probably the coconut water; it had a residual flavor and feel.<br /><br />There was no straw included with the package, so the opening and pouring needed the assistance of a fork or knife.  It's mostly (cane) sugar water, so why bother?<br /><br />But the biggest issue is the waste.  Coconut sugar water from Indonesia?  What's the carbon footprint of this product?  And the container has 2 ""recycle"" symbols on it, but, like milk cartons, it is difficult to find a community that will actually keep them out of the landfill.<br /><br />Bottom line?  It's not that tasty, being little more than sugar water, and the transport and packaging waste really don't fit into a culture (for me) focusing on sustainability."

negative,4/8/21,"I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo."
negative,4/8/21,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."
negative,18/7/21,"We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck."
negative,18/10/21,"Although this seems like a great product it is definitely not minced.  The cans say it is minced but it isn't, it is ground beef.  My cat ONLY likes minced.  Not chunks, not ground.  Although she will eat ground cat food sometimes, it has to be inviting and delicious, yet she just walks away from this.<br /><br />I hate it when the packaging lies about the contents of a product.  The shipping was speedy and the value is great (as long as they deliver what the promise) now I am stuck with food my cat wont eat at all."
negative,15/6/21,"I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).<br /><br />The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.<br /><br />Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.<br /><br />My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.<br /><br />I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.<br /><br />TRY THIS INSTEAD: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCUBZ0"">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Indoor Feline Fomula Dry Cat Food, 15-Pound Bag</a>"
negative,4/8/21,I did not know anything about chutney until I went on a known recipe cite and found out that they mix the fruit with peppers and vinegar! I thought chutney was a different form of Marmalade but I was wrong!
negative,8/6/21,"I received this box with great anticipation since they don't sell these on the west coast. I got the package, opened the box and was EXTREMELY disappointed. The cookies looked like a gorilla shook the box to death and left most of the box filled with crumbs. AND THERE WAS A RODENT SIZED HOLE ON THE SIDE OF THE BOX!!!!!!!! So, needless to say I will not NOT be reordering these again."
negative,15/6/21,"I made cupcakes with the vanilla cake mix.  They were just ok.  They were dense, but not overly so.  So that wasn't too bad. The flavor, however, is where I was disappointed.  The vanilla flavor was so subtle that I missed it entirely, and I felt like there needed to be a little more sweetness (which probably would have also made them a bit more moist). The child I made them for only ate a few bites."
negative,4/8/21,I tried vanilla cake mix and pizza crust mix and was disappoined in both.  They had a medicinal bitter taste and even smelled strange.  I threw both items away.
negative,25/9/21,"The chocolate cake is fantastic, so I had reason to think that this would be as well - not the case.  It was very dense & tasteless - totally unlike the airy, tasty chocolate.<br />I want my money back or an even exchange for the chocolate cake mix."
negative,19/10/21,I was expecting these cookies were going to be normal size but i was wrong!  i was planning on dipping them in chocolates but they r not those average size at all! So disappointed! I now have to go out n find the normal size cookies. What a  waste of money. I also needed 50 but 20 of them were broken. They do not put fragile on the box outside.
negative,4/9/21,"Reading in earlier reviews that these were genuine chinese fortunes, I served them with a chinese Christmas dinner and was greatly disappointed, as were my guests.  Three sample fortunes are:  ""Life is not a struggle.  It's a wiggle.""  ""Management is doing things right: leadership is doing the right things.""  ""If you're feeling down, try throwing yourself into your work.""  These are not fortunes, they are self-help mini-bites.  A fortune is:  ""Your love of travel will soon be satisfied,"" and it doesn't matter if they are predictive or not.  What matters is that they state a fortune.  ""Beware the dog in the corner house,"" would be fun to get.  ""Life is a wiggle"" is boring.<br />The cookies arrived on schedule, as promised, and in good condition in their individual wrappers.  All of that was as I'd hoped.  But content counts, in fortune cookies especially."
negative,31/8/21,"I love these cookies, they taste exactly like Oreos. But unfortunately, every time I eat them (2 cookies at a time)I get horrible headaches and migraines (which I don't get from real Oreos) Its obviously caused by some of the 'nutritious' ingredients. Another thumbs down---they include vitamin K which should not be eaten by anyone on blood thinners, or for anyone middle-aged or older who overindulges in these cookies be warned---vitamin K can cause blood clots.<br />HEADACHE & MIGRAINE SUFFERERS BEWARE of these cookies!"
negative,9/10/21,"I've had many types of pepper jelly, and this is by far the worst ever. The price is high, and the taste is not good. The shipping was outrageous. More costly than the green pepper jelly. Don't waste you money."
negative,15/6/21,"i'm a big fan of hodgson mill products (we love their bread mixes, i use their pancake mixes.) i'm not afraid of whole grains  (i mill my own grains, wheat, kamut, rye, barley) and i even put milled flax seed in my (home made) yogurt. I've been a baker for 35 years and love to try new recipes.<br /><br />i had high expectations for this product but was very disappointed by the results: the box calls for too much fat and the baked brownies have a distinctly oily feel in the mouth.  I can enjoy the grittiness and the chocolate flavor is fine but i would caution buyers against the results if following the instructions on the box<br /><br />one of the problems is that the coarse texture of the mix does not allow the fat to be absorbed well.<br /><br />i will go back to making whole wheat brownies from scratch.  a little bit of time required... a little less convenient but brownies being a treat (and comfort food), the texture should be right :)"
negative,4/8/21,"first off, i love whole wheat products, and flax seed so i hope we just got a bad batch (and no it wasn't expired, i checked the date) but my mom and i just had some of these and we're not fans. they had an oddly fishy/grassy taste to it kind of like you might get with rancid flax oil tablets.

negative,15/6/21,"I have made potato bread before with great results but this Hodgson bread-mix is way too dry, it needs some more moisture-don't buy it unless you want really dry bread."
negative,4/8/21,"White bread is not my thing, so that's probably why I don't like this one.  I like herby white breads and really full-bodied white breads, but otherwise I always choose whole grains.  This one is not full-bodied and has no particular flavor.  Not interesting at all to me."
negative,15/6/21,"I've been eating Snow's clam chowder for years, so I buy a few cans when it's on sale. Well it looks like Bumble Bee has taken over. What a big mistake. When I opened the can, it was all watery and smelled funny. I put it in a bowl to microwave, and noticed how thin it was, but thought I'd try it anyway. It was nasty to say the least. It about made me sick. So I went and opened another of the new cans, more of the same. Then I got an older can of the non-Bumble Bee chowder and it was great like always. If I could give the new junk no stars, I would. Sucks bad."
negative,4/8/21,"Looks like and tastes like chocolate colored water. No chocolate flavor whatsoever, this was a complete disappointment.  I got the hot chocolate k-cups from swiss miss instead.  How people can be giving this product four and five stars is astounding to me, is the Amazon ratings system being gamed for this product?"
negative,1/10/21,"When I bought my Keurig brewer, I eagerly looked for other beverage options for my wife who is not a coffee drinker.  I'm still looking.  The Grove Square Hot Cocoa had a nasty aftertaste, almost metallic.  No amount of cleaning/tinkering with the brewer made any improvement.  I used the brewer to make hot water for a Nestle Hot Cocoa pack, and that was a far superior beverage.  The Grove Square quickly found it's way to the trash.  I'll find quality mixes and use the Keurig to heat the water from now on."
negative,1/7/18,"Since I am willing to try alot of new things. I thought that I would buy this product.. And since I do like hot cocoa, I bought 2 boxes.. WORST thing I could have done.. This is bland, with very little flavour. It also has a grainy texture near the bottom of the mug.<br />Personally I will not buy this product again. I will stay with swiss miss or another hot cocoa brand for the Keurig K-Cup"
negative,10/8/18,"Just plain nasty!!! This item tasted like cardboard, very watered down and no flavor to it at all.  Very disappointed"
negative,1/7/18,"Thin, runny, and the fake milk powder used to add ""creaminess"" has an off flavor. Better off eating your ceramic mug."
negative,10/8/18,"I don't expect great hot chocolate from a k-cup, but it should at least taste like there's some cocoa in it. I can't believe how bad this stuff tastes. I tried it 3 times, and then threw the rest away."
negative,13/9/18,"I wish I had listened to the other bad reviews.  The artificial sweetener taste is awful.  I gave two stars only because my husband doesn't seem to mind.  I can't drink this- even if they were a bargain."
negative,17/7/18,"So bad, I returned it. My children didn't even like it, and they are not difficult to please when it comes to sweet drinks or food."
negative,16/1/19,"The artificial sweetener ruined this for me... It leaves the fake sugar taste in your mouth and my husband, who drinks diet soda, even noticed. At least it wasn't pricey."
negative,16/1/18,"I tried to find the ingredients for this hot cocoa before I bought it, but couldn't find anything online. Turns out it has one of those mile long ingredient lists, and yet, that didn't help the taste at all. It is awful.<br /><br />I had three boxes of the stuff sitting around for a month and couldn't find any takers. I finally got rid it of it at the Christmas White Elephant gift exchange at work. I put it with a nice cookbook, which was the real present, and wrapped it real prettily. Unfortunately, the boss ended up with it. I haven't asked him if his family enjoyed it because I don't want to put him on the spot. Judging by the reviews, there are a lot of people who like it - hopefully, he will, too. Maybe it just depends on how your taste buds are trained. Mine grew up with hot chocolate made on the stove, with milk, cocoa and sugar, and maybe a tiny pinch of salt.  Compared to that, this stuff tastes like a chemical experiment.<br /><br />Anyway, instead of trying one of the other brands, I now heat some milk in the microwave, stir in a couple spoonfuls of Hershey's cocoa and some sugar to taste. It takes about three minutes, and it's delicious. Now, where did I put those mini-marshmallows?"
negative,16/1/19,"Well you get what you paid for. While this milk chocolate k-cup is pretty cheap $12.95 per 24 (54 cents per count) but it is not good. It tasted like watered down chocolate (as if you put in too much water and not enough milk or chocolate/cacao for that matter). This thing is sweet tho, in fact kinda too sweet for my taste (i am beginning to think half of the powdery content is sugar/sweetener). I thought it was the amount of water that made it taste watered down so I lowered the cup size from 8 ounce to 6 ounce on my Keurig brewer and it's the same thing."
negative,1/8/20,"This is much too watery. It tastes very much like the tasteless hot cocoa one gets out of a vending machine.  After receiving the box and reading the list of ingredients,  I've decided not to order again.  This product if definitely not worth the money."
negative,1/7/18,"With <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00389Q4XW"">Green Mountain Hot Cocoa</a> being perpetually out of stock in the winter, I thought I'd give the cheaper Grove Square brand a shot.<br /><br />Since the K-Cup patents are starting to sunset, Grove Square is one of the first ""unofficial"" producers of ""we can't legally call these K-Cups but they work in your Keurig(R)(TM) coffee maker"" pods, and I thought that I'd be getting the same overall quality, without the licensing fees tacked on to the price.<br /><br />Well... I was right about Grove Square being cheaper. But I think that's the nicest I can be.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, there's a definite ""diet"" or ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6LBXK"">Splenda</a>"" aftertaste. This hadn't been reviewed yet when I bought it, so I didn't see the warnings from others, and re-checked the ingredients several times to make sure.<br /><br />""Well... it's got 60 calories, which seems a bit lower than Green Mountain, but a bit high for something that diet-conscious people would want."" and the ingredient list didn't seem to point to obvious ""diet"" sweeteners.<br /><br />The overall taste is kind of like someone dropped a sugar-free Tootsie Roll in your hot water, using the normal cup setting. Going one size down didn't seem to improve much, beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter - but that just meant a heavier shot of low-calorie sweetener to the taste buds.<br /><br />The way I see it, I saved about $5 by going with this brand. On the other hand, now I've got 20 of these cups left that are probably going in the trash if I can't sucker someone... er... please my discerning guests... with a few cups.<br /><br />If you drink diet soft drinks by choice, you're probably going to like this."
negative,10/8/18,"This tastes terrible...  Like putting aritficial sweetener in already sweet hot chocolate.  The best I have tried so far is Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate K-Cups.  Don't think they are sold on Amazon yet..."
negative,15/2/20,"My whole family(7 people) tasted all 3 flavors and they are sickly sweet.  Very disappointed that product has sucralose.  I wouldn't buy it again"
negative,22/4/21,"Using 8 oz water as the directions state made the cocoa much too weak. It was like hot water with a few drops of chocolate syrup. Using 6 oz made the cocoa much too sweet, and still too weak in the chocolate department. It uses sucralose as a sweetener, which gives it a very intensely sweet flavor. This may not be a problem for those who like very sweet things or don't mind the taste of sucralose. Unfortunately, I'm not one of those people."
negative,25/9/20,"Can't tell you how this tastes, because I read the ingredients first, but it has trans-fats in every flavor. :( The seller should disclose all ingredients in the description. I wouldn't have purchased this otherwise."
negative,16/11/19,"I received my order of Grove Square hot cocoa mix today, and was very shocked to see that hydrogenated oil was one of the ingredients in the mix. I have avoided using any products that contains trans fats because of the negative effects on blood lipid levels. I would urge Amazon to require an itemized list of ingredients for all food items listed for sale. If the ingredients had been listed, those of us who have concerns about our health can avoid these products."
negative,9/9/20,This does not taste like cocoa it is very weak no matter what cup size you use.I is just not good.
negative,1/7/18,"When I got my Keurig I fell in love. I bought a bunch of different sample packs and two boxes of the grove square hot cocoa. I'm a bit of a hot cocoa nut, partially because I can't have caffeine, and partially because it brings back wonderful memories of playing in the snow and the fun of warming up afterwards. I really wanted to love this hot cocoa. I tried all three flavors multiple times, in different ways. I tried them on the different cup sizes, adding things, etc. There's just this strange taste to them that doesn't sit well on the tongue. I'm not sure what it is, but it has a faint ring of sour milk. It really lingers, and I haven't found anything that takes the taste away. I'm going to give my second box to a friend, she doesn't seem to notice it. My daughter and husband both said it tasted weird, so it's not just me. I also took it to a friend's house and have tried them in three different Keurig machines, JUST to make sure mine didn't need to be descaled. So I guess my suggestion is to try it before you go for the multiple boxes."
negative,10/8/18,"This has to be without a doubt the WORST tasting Hot Chocolate ever! The best way to describe the taste of ""This Stuff"" is really cheap suger free instant hot chocolate. Swiss Miss instant is way better and cost less. After only 3 cups threw the rest in the garbage where it belongs and canceled my subscribe and save for this ""SLOP""!"
negative,15/1/20,"I guess there is a reason that the ingredient section on this page doesn't mention that the first ingredient is trans fat (partially hydrogenated oil).  Had I know, I would not have purchased this.  Consumers need to vote with their dollars and avoid buying items where the manufacturer is using cheap and unhealthy ingredients."

Not worth it to us."

negative,30/8/20,"I was very excited to get some hot chocolate cups for my Keurig and even happier there was a variety pack.  I read the reviews and even there were some negative ones, I went with it anyways.<br />I tried the milk chocolate.  It has such a weird taste to it.  But I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried another later that night.  Same weird aftertaste.  I asked my husband to try it to make sure my taste buds weren't off. He commented that it had a ""hot plastic-y"" aftertaste to it.  Not even worth drinking.  Too bad I have 34 more cups that will go to waste."
negative,1/7/18,"As a hot chocolate lover, I was verrrrry disappointed when I tried this product. I first had the peppermint (disgusting) and then tried the dark chocolate (a little better). The problem is that you can REALLY taste the artifical sweetener. I am a diet soda drinker, so I don't have a problem with artifical sweetener. It's just that the taste was so strong in these hot chocolates that it overpowered the chocolate taste. I definitely will NOT buy again.... I would not recommend these to anyone."
negative,10/8/18,"I'm an avid hot chocolate drinker, and this is just doesn't measure up.  It reminds me of the sugar free Swiss Miss.  No matter what size you set your cup on, it's just missing that cocoa flavor.  Maybe the dark chocolate would be better.

There was no ingredient list, company logo, allergen information, or anything else you'd expect to find on food packages. I certainly wouldn't eat food that arrived in a plastic bag with a twist tie.  I did ask that it be shipped next day, so maybe they couldn't take the time to package it in the advertised tub.  Amazon was nice enough to give me a full refund, which was the only positive part of the experience."
negative,19/10/21,"I bought this for fathers day. My father loves dried fruits and nuts.<br /><br />It came in a somewhat cute crate box, and each compartment was in a plastic bag. That means that if you don't eat the nuts in one sitting they will go stale, as they are now sitting in the open. Same story for the fruit.<br /><br />While all the bags were closed when my father opened them he found that the nuts were stale and the fruit were hard/chewy.<br /><br />I recommend purchasing this if you need a centerpiece, but not if you actually want to eat it."
negative,4/7/21,"I have to say that I really wanted to like these muffins, but I could not.  They have a really bitter after taste.  Whether this is attributable to the gluten free nature of the product, I do not know.  The Hodgson Mill Blueberry Muffin Mix is a far better choice.  On a positive note, they do raise very nicely, but it is unfortunate that I find them barely edible and have five more boxes of the mix left."
negative,11/9/21,"This product comes from a very good company that makes a number of excellent Gluten free as well as non-gluten free baking products. DO NOT let the poor quality of this one product keep you from trying other products they make. This mix is a classic example of a very poorly designed and likely untested Gluten free product. It lacks enough sugar and moisture ingredients to make the finished product taste good and mix well. As with many Gluten Free products new to the market, you find yourself constantly adding ""something"" to try to make it right. To these, I had to add nearly a full cup of sugar to begin to dissipate the very bitter taste. I added both applesauce and plain yogurt during different baking sessions to get a consistency that would feel and move like a muffin mix. THIS mix takes too much ""Doctoring"" to be recommended at all until Hodgson Mill goes back to the drawing board and fixes this. BUT, Hodgson Mill does have other good products. Try their Blueberry Muffin Mix and hope that one day Amazon will carry a wider array of their Gluten Free offerings as many are very, very good."
negative,12/9/21,I bought these at my local grocery store. I wish I would have read the review on here first. The positive is they do hold together well and look like a muffin. The negative is they are so bitter. I could barely finish my half. I just recently found out I have Celiac Disease  so I cant have gluten. I have never tried a gluten free muffin mix before so I can not compare it to any others. I have tried the Betty Crocker Gluten Free brownie mix and that is wonderful. So I do believe there would be a good muffin mix out there.
negative,13/7/21,"I was really excited and surprised when I found this mix in my local Wal Mart. Given it was a good price, I figured Id give it a shot.... before I whipped up a batch I figured Id do a little investigating to see if there was any input/ suggestions on the mix. WOW. Is everyone using the same mix or what? Reviews from ""its great"" to ""its horrible""..like a total 50/50 split. SOOOooo, before  I wasted a bunch of money on products to whip up a batch and see for myself, I figured Id simply open the packae up and take a taste to the mix, all on its own.... ummmmm, yeah. It TOTALLY has a pretty strong bitter after taste. :/ And , like another reviewer, I had figured this mix would be adequately sweet enough for me and not need any extra sweetener (I dont like things very sweet, at all) but its DEF not. As I re read the ingredients I realized there isnt ANY sugar/sweetener in this mix so, youd def NEED to add sweetening. But, overall, I dont even plan on taking this mix that far. Im pretty certain that adding sugar wont take that aftertaste away. Thats an issue with the flour mix and no amount of sugar is going to make that go away..... Id strongly suggest avoiding this mix.... I hope the company works on this mix. It has good elements to it (I like the fact you can determine how sweet youd want it and the apple pieces are pretty tasty) and I think it COULD be really tasty."
negative,23/10/21,"If I could, I would give it zero stars.  I am not a picky eater, but this mix did not rise (can you say hockey puck), was extremely bitter, and not sweet even with the recommended amount of sweetener added.  Save your money."
negative,22/9/21,"I concur with previous reviewers in that these muffins have such a bitter taste! I also bake often and I'm certain it wasn't me. My gluten-eating husband didn't like them either. They were also dense.<br />If you are looking for an apple cinnamon flavor and need a mix, you might be better off using Pamela's Baking Mix (which is awesome!) and adding apples and cinnamon to it. The muffin recipe is on the back of the Pamela bag.<br />In conclusion, I don't recommend these; they were really disappointing."

negative,11/9/21,"This Hot cocoa is the nastiest tasting instant cocoa I've ever had. I know it's not going to taste like the real thing, but after just three cups I can't bring myself to finishing the box. I think I'll just throw them out. Our k-cup machine is about a month old and the coffee flavors we've tried are all fine so we wanted to try the cocoa. The first try was very watery so I thought the cup size needs to be reduced. This results in just a sweeter cup of hot water. Stick with coffee."

negative,24/10/21,"Sure to be a hit with chalk-a-holics everywhere, from first sip to last this product suggests its European heritage deep in the chalk mines of southern France.<br /><br />Some seem to be making a case for it only having 60 calories, but the Keurig Chai Latte only has 70, and that product actually tastes pretty good.<br /><br />I have yet to find a Keurig-compatible hot chocolate that stands up to plain old Swiss Miss, scooped from a tub or a foil packet. And Swiss Miss isn't that great to begin with, although it sure is cheaper than this stuff.<br /><br />I wonder if the size of the Keurig capsule limits the amount of cocoa and powdered milk that can be put into a cup, so what ends up there has to be strong and highly compromised."
negative,4/7/21,"Gross! I tried these thinking they would at least taste like the regular powdered mixes.  The flavor is all fake sweetener (odd since sucralose is the last ingredient) and no dark chocolate.  I am bummed because now I have a box of these cups and don't want to drink them."
negative,11/9/21,"My son would rather have no cookie than one of these cookies. The taste is okay. The texture is hard and weird even when microwaved. Short shelf life if you are buying in bulk. Not absolutely terrible but worse than average. Try Pamela's chocolate chip cookies they are wonderful, or try a baking mix."

Cheap beans, bad roast, whatever, my lot actually tastes like it is moldy. Maybe I just got a bad batch. I have tried the Buzzworthy dark roast Melitta Pods and they are drinkable, even though I prefer medium roast coffees. Suggest you try one box of these, not the 4 box lot I'm stuck with. Also, to help you evaluate this response better, you should know that I like quality roast Kenya AA or Sumatra or Columbian Supremo, etc. rich flavor type coffees. I don't like Folgers, Maxwell House, pedestrian type blends, but even those are way better than this coffee."

I bought a 4-box package of three different types & am now stuck with them. Forget these & head to Juan Valdez (same price range) unless you like weak coffee."
negative,11/9/21,"I'm flabbergasted by the glowing reviews that ""truffle oil"" is receiving on Amazon! Those of you espousing a desire to drizzle this stuff on your food might be sorely disappointed to learn that the truffle flavor in those tiny $17 bottles of ""truffle oil"" are made in a laboratory. There's not a molecule of actual truffle in them. It's a sinful shame that's perpetuated despite being outed a few years ago in an enlightening New York Times article called ""Hocus-Pocus, and a Beaker of Truffles."" Read it and weep: [...]<br /><br />And if you see ""truffle oil"" advertised on the menu somewhere, you might ask if they're using any other artificial flavorings in their dishes..."
negative,20/9/21,"I love the product.  But, the bottle design is terrible.  In order to get the last 1/3 or so of the body wash out of the bottle in a timely manner you would normally store the bottle upside down.  With the pointy top that is impossible.

I've tried quite a few teas and I've been able to drink teas that others say taste like dirty dish water so I can get down some pretty harsh teas.  I usually don't use any type of sweeteners either because I drink my tea right before bed.  I've tried to give this tea a chance.  Ive tried it with sugar, honey and lemon and masking the flavor with vanilla and a little milk.  To me, this tea smells like dirty feet and probably tastes like them too.  I've also tried straight chamomile teas before too so I know it's not that.  I would rather eat the plant itself than drink this tea.  I haven't tried any other Twinings products so this review is strictly for this product."

However on the actual boxes the ingrediant showed it was packed in another oil....an unhealthy oil.  That was the bad news.  The good news is Amazon, as usual, was gracious and professional in allowing me to return this item which is considered to be 'not returnable'.  That is why I buy everything online from Amazon.com.  They are the best."

Snack creators branching out by offering traditional products in slightly different forms results in me expressing negative comments via reviews. And why, oh, why does everything have to be miniaturized in order to appeal to rugrats and the type of people who have to proclaim their brood with stick figure-ish stickers on the back of their vehicle?

I admit, it was a big mistake to order a whole stupid case without trying them first.  When I opened them, they looked totally unappetizing and then I tasted them......it tasted just like a rice cake/styrofoam with salt on it.  They also have a very unusual texture.  The combination of taste and texture was very disappointing.  My teenage daughter tried them and felt the same way - not even the dog would eat them.  We tried them with a variety of dips and couldn't come up with a tolerable way to choke them down.<br /><br />Luckily, I have a niece that is newly vegetarian, hungry all the time, and she took these off my hands.  I am still out $25 for buying the case of these to begin with...what a waste!"
negative,9/7/21,"Just plug and play with your preferred software.  No hassles, worked great for about 3 months then just stopped working.

Totally dissapointed."
negative,22/6/21,"I will admit, the Icicle does allow you to plug any mic with an XLR jack to your computer using a USB jack. It does indeed provide phantom power to condenser mics and it will deliver a signal to your recording software.<br /><br />Beyond that, the usefulness depends on your mic and what you consider an acceptable recording level.<br /><br />I tried this with an AKG 200, BLUE enCORE 200 and an AKG 4500. All deliver very nice sound when used in a conventional recording chain. I could barely get an audible record level yelling into the enCORE 200, my staple for location voice recording. Normally, I plug the enCORE directly into a digital audio recorder with an XLR cable. No mic preamp, no phantom power, no EQ, and I get a good clean clear sound level near the peak of input level.<br /><br />This is one very disappointing product. If you route your mic through a preamp, then put the Icicle between the preamp and the USB input of your computer, you can get a decent record level, but that extra equipment is what this light weight gadget is supposed to avoid. Personally, I think you might be better off getting a decent channel strip* or mic preamp and an XLR to to mini jack to go between the channel strip and your computer input and forget the Icicle altogether.<br /><br />BLUE makes some great products, but this is not one of their better ones.<br /><br />*For those that don't know, Channel Strips combine several pieces of equipment into one box: typically a mic preamp and a compressor. Higher end units add some EQ capability as well or have other options."
negative,2/8/21,"I was told by the salesman at Guitar Center that the Icicle was easy and very high quality. . .  It is perfectly easy but I have had nothing but problems from mine. There is a constant popping in anything I record.  I am using an AKG C3000B microphone I have had for a long time and it is in perfect condition so the problem is not with my mic.  Anyone else having this problem? Haven't been in touch with tech support yet, but I will say I am not happy with the Icicle. . ."

negative,1/8/21,"I have been using a standard XLR to USB cable with my Shure 58 dynamic mic, which works okay, except for an annoying hissing noise that accompanies the majority of my vocal recordings.  I bought the Icicle in hopes of eliminating those noise issues.<br /><br />When I received the Icicle, I couldn't wait to plug it in and take it for a ""test"" drive. Unfortunately, right off, I got an error - unable to load drivers.  This is a plug and play device, so there are no drivers to download, and I knew something wasn't right. After 3 restarts and uninstalling the USB Hubs and ports numerous times, as suggested by Icicle's troubleshooting website, it was still a no go.  I went to Icicle's website and logged a ticket, explaining the issues in detail and that I was running Windows 7.  The next day, I received an email instructing me to send the Icicle back, as it has a defective driver.  Amazon was GREAT about sending a replacement while the return was on its way.<br /><br />So, I received the replacement Icicle today, pulled it out of its packaging and with bated breath, plugged it in, hoping for success. No such luck - the same error message came up about the drivers. I decided to Google my issue:  ""Icicle compatibility with Windows 7"", and Bam!, it took me to a Guitar Center review of the Icicle that CLEARLY shows in the product specifications that it is NOT compatible with Windows 7.<br /><br />Amazon needs to get on the ball and add this to their information.  It is nowhere in Amazon's description and the Icicle ""techs"" themselves didn't have a clue about it either. I found this inadequacy with the blue mic technical team to be unacceptable.  They probably have non-technical CSRs pretending to be techs for all their troubleshooting. That's one way to save a dime, but please people - if you're going to give us ""technical support"", then say so.  If it isn't really technical support, then say it is Customer Service.<br /><br />I am terribly disappointed that this device has not been upgraded to accommodate the newer technologies.  Windows 7 has been out for some time now.  There is no indication in the little mini booklet that comes in the Icicle package that says Windows 7 is incompatible -it only gives set-up info for Mac and Windows (does not show which OS).  I am sending my Icicle back to Amazon for a refund and will need to look for something that WILL work with Windows 7.<br /><br />If you have a PC that was purchased in 2011 or later, save yourself the hassle and don't bother with this product, as your OS will more than likely be Windows 7."
negative,16/7/21,"Picked one up to use with a laptop running Windows 7 Home Premium.  The computer saw the item, but said it needed troubleshooting.  Nothing worked.  After researching online, I found that many people had run into this problem.  Apparently, the firmware is not compatible with Windows 7; it's supposedly been corrected in newer runs, but there's no way to tell if the one you're purchasing is newer or not.  I tried contacting Blue, twice, hoping to get a firmware update, or check into exchanging it, but never got a response from both attempts, so I finally just had to return it."

negative,26/6/21,"I wanted to like this product, as it would have been a fast and easy solution for many of my needs, but it didn't work well at all.  Very noisy.  Lots of hissing and pops that are completely absent when using the same mics and computers with other adapter devices.  Considering the decent reviews by others, I may just have a defective unit.  Either way... it's going back in the mail today."

negative,19/10/21,"Been gluten free for 7 years now. Thought we were done with mixes that tasted awful.  We threw it away because we did not like it. For my money, you can't beat Pamela's baking mix.

negative,2/8/21,"I was hoping Bisquick got it right when they released this product, but they missed their mark.<br /><br />I made both biscuits and dumplings (chicken & Dumplings). The biscuits came out okay but the flavor was bland. The dumplings were fluffy but not very flavorful and turned hard after a day or two."
negative,11/6/21,"I love pancakes, so giving up gluten was hard for me.  I've used Bisquick for pancakes for years with great results.  Alas, the best I got from the Gluten-Free version was edible, but not enjoyable.  It tasted a lot like pillow foam, not in a good way.  I will probably keep the mix for breading things, but not for pancakes.  I've found much better options."
negative,22/10/21,"Overall, this mix is okay, but, the sugar content is very, very high. You can actually see the sugar in the mix if you look closely. For pancakes or waffles, this is fine, but for savory concoctions, this is not acceptable. Sausage balls, casseroles, and biscuits all come out almost inedible.This mix is also oddly gritty. The grit is very fine, but still makes my teeth want to curl.  I recommend Pamela's baking and pancake mix, as it is smoother, and much more versatile, because it's not as sweet. A good cook knows you can always add more of something, but you can't take it out if you've added too much.<br /><br />That being said, if you're traveling and this is the only mix they have, it's better than nothing."
negative,6/8/21,"I made the waffles and was not impressed.<br />Definitely not worth the expense!<br /><br />It's only redeeming quality was that I seasoned it to bread oven fried pork chops.<br />I would rather have saved my money and made up a flour mix from scratch."
negative,24/6/21,"Thought I had died and gone to heaven when I made the bisquit recipe.  I was wrong! Went to indigestion hell.  I had serious hope for this product. I truley loved the mix, but it didn't love me.  I haven't had indigestion since I gave up gluten until I ate a bisquit from this mix.  Best luck on getting it right bisquick."
negative,17/4/21,"I will first say that I have only tried making pancakes with GF Bisquick. My family's experience with these pancakes, however, was very disappointing, and I will not be trying any other recipe. I have tried Betty Crocker's GF Brownies, and loved them, so when I decided to spend a little extra and try GF Bisquick I was greatly let down by the result. We couldn't even finish them, we just threw them out. If you can tolerate tree nuts and milk products, I recommend trying Pamela's Pancake Mix. Otherwise, if you are looking for great GF pancakes, look elsewhere - GF Bisquick is not worth it, in our opinion."
negative,10/3/21,"My personal preference is to stay clear of this. I did not like the smell or taste. I was attempting to make pizza crust for the first time. On my second attempt it came out better, but I did not like the taste of it. If I at least liked the taste, I would buy again and make my crust very thin."
negative,17/4/21,"I bought these for pancakes, and I haven't used it to make any other recipes, so I cannot speak for how it makes biscuits, or any other item. But for pancakes, it's a no-go. They have a hint of pancake-flavor with lots of butter & syrup; but I don't like smoothering my pancakes in fattening syrup, so these pancakes are NOT for me. Moving on to other mixes..."
negative,21/1/21,"When I saw the ingredients on this box I knew it would be a disappointment. It would be much better and pretty easy just to make your own mix. Also, there are plenty of other quality mixes out there like Pamela's and Bob's Red Mill. This will be a huge disappointment to you so don't waste your money."
negative,30/1/21,"Reading other reviews, I was excited to try this mix since it appeared to be Gluten free/dairy free.  Technically, the dry mix is GF/DF but the basic pancake recipe calls for eggs and milk.  Technically I can use my own egg and milk substitutes but then I could already do this with so many other mixes.  I've found that mixes that request eggs and/or milk really are better with the originals not substitutes.  The best GF/DF mixes already include a substitute so the directions only require water and/or oil or other non-dairy ingredients.  In this case, I will return to my old favorite mixes by ""The cravings place"" - these are truely targeted for a GF + DF lifestyle.  That said, if you are not DF then perhaps this is a fine choice. It would have been better to have a print/picture of the back of the package to more clearly see that this is not a great DF option."
negative,13/2/21,"These pancakes are gross... they are pale and do not taste like pancakes. I bought these based on the reviews because the Maple Grove Farms pancakes were out of stock that week. I expected a lot more from Bisquick. I mean, when these pancakes are fully cooked they look like pale wafers of cream of wheat. If you leave them in a little longer to get some color, they just get hard and taste worse. I hate wasting food so I forced myself to finish the 3 boxes.. but I dont think I'll buy these again even if my other ones are out of stock. The only reason I gave these 2 stars is because they are gluten free. Other than that they're awful.. I'm so glad I've got my Maple Groves back this week and that these are out of my pantry!"
negative,15/1/21,"Was awful. The sight of this in my pan made me sick...smells like POTATO  duh potato starch)...would not brown. My child laughed the entire time...as I complained because I was so hungry and thought I could have a late night pancake session. Totally not the case.  Yes, I am a GF newbie... I tossed the box!"
negative,6/3/21,Pure toxic garbage. Eat poison if you want to. Toxic metals. Go ahead and buy this junk and feed yourself poison. Look at all the high ratings. Apparently people love eating toxic metals. Not harmful? Would you eat sodium mercury phosphate? Enjoy your metals.
negative,8/6/21,A great idea that falls short. Bisquick gluten-free still uses an aluminum-based baking powder that is toxic to humans. Aluminum lodges in our bodies and has been found in quantities unacceptable in autistic individuals. The company refuses to respond to customer inquiries concerning this. I cannot give this to my family until the baking powder formula has been changed.
negative,7/1/21,"I actually was delighted to find this product, and my family and I loved the recipes made with it.  However it has sugar as the 2nd ingredient AND worse it has aluminum in it.  Why would I intentionally feed my family something neuro-toxic when I am trying to avoid gluten to keep healthy?  I sure wish those companies who jump on the GF bandwagon would keep health in the equation.  My kids bowel movements are gluten free too, but I wouldn't serve it to them for breakfast.  Just sayin..."
negative,17/4/21,"I am thorougly disgusted with Betty Crocker for this product (Gluten-free Bisquick), which is a shame, because I do applaud them for their excellent cake, cookie, and brownie mixes.<br /><br />I'm not upset with them for for coming out with a gluten-free baking mix, but for:<br /><br />#1) marketing it as though it's an equivalent to Bisquick and<br />#2) for pricing it so ridiculously high.<br /><br />Ingredients for regular Bisquick: Enriched flour, Partiallly hydrogenated soybean and/or cottonseed oil, leavening, dextrose, salt.<br /><br />Ingredients for gluten-free Bisquick:  Rice Flour, Sugar, Leavening (baking soda, sodium aluminum phosphate, monocalcium phosphate), Modified Potato Starch, Salt, Xanthan Gum<br /><br />Notice anything missing from the ingredients of gluten-free Bisquick? Yup, that's right--there's no shortening (or oil).<br /><br />That was the whole point of the original Bisquick--a baking mix that ALREADY HAD THE SHORTENING MIXED IN.  That avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits  That is why people buy baking mixes--for that specific convenience.<br /><br />Betty Crocker has decided to leave out the shortening (or oil) altogether, even though shortening (or oil) is always naturally gluten-free. So they can't pretend it's a safety-for-celiacs factor.  It's a cost-savings to them, pure and simple.<br /><br />Here's the breakdown of what you're paying $5 a pound for:<br />rice flour (99 cents a pound at my local Asian store),<br />sugar ($2.88 for a 5 pound bag at Walmart) ,<br />potato starch (also 99 cents a pound at the Asian store),<br />baking powder ($3.19 a pound at Emergency Essentials),<br />salt ($2 for 26 ounces of Morton's),<br />xanthan gum ($10.45 for 4 ounce on Amazon).<br /><br />Yes, xanthan gum is expensive--but very, very little is needed; a 16-ounce box of gluten-free Bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gum--maybe 20 cents' worth of xanthan gum.<br /><br />Betty Crocker is charging over 5 times what it would cost you to make their ""mix"" at home, while eliminating the major convenience factor (and cost to themselves, but not to you) of their regular baking mix.<br /><br />I don't mind their making a fair profit, especially if the product really WERE the equivalent of regular Bisquick.  But they're gouging us, and being misleading about the product.<br /><br />MAKE YOUR OWN, EASILY, AND FOR LESS THAN 20% OF WHAT THEY CHARGE!<br /><br />Since there's no oil in gluten-free Bisquick, you can easily stir up an equivalent, make 5 pounds (or more!) at a time, with very little effort, and it will keep for several months.<br /><br />Or, if you want a REAL Bisquick substitutes, betterbatter.org has a recipe on the site for a cup-for-cup substitute for Bisquick that DOES use shortening and non-fat dry milk powder.  Or you can use buttermilk powder, or even Vance's dairy-free powder.  It makes 10 cups at a time, stores well, and you don't have to use their gluten-free flour--you can use any gluten-free flour replacement you want (like rice flour and potato starch from your local Asian store, mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum, about 1/2 teaspoon for every two cups).<br /><br />To find the recipe, do a google search of ""betterbatter Bisquick Substitute Master Mix.""<br /><br />Boo on Betty Crocker."
negative,10/3/21,"I regularly purchase this item in the bulk and loved it because it was also dairy free.<br />However, my last purchase was disappointing, after opening a brand new package I noticed a black thing in the mix, carefully removed to find out it was a dead flour beetle! I sifted the mix and found more DEAD BUGS!<br /><br />This is the second time I writing this review. Amazon didn't publish my first review. Thank you AMAZON.<br />I will not be purchasing this item again."
negative,14/1/21,"I have been Gluten Free Since 2003 and this is I think the worst tasting GF mix I have come across. I have found all to have their own pros and cons but this one have very little to brag about. I appreciate the effort anyone puts into a GF product but I couldn't buy this one again. It was like eating reconstituted potatoes that lookes like pancakes. No butter or gravy, just dehydrated spuds. The only real good thing to speak of was the texture. It was light and moist but I would have to seriously alter the recipe to add flavor."
negative,24/5/21,"I read lots of good reviews and loved the idea of the convenience of this mix for pancakes and waffles.  So I whipped up some pancakes, breakfast-for-dinner style.  I'm newly diagnosed celiac and thus new to GF, so perhaps I should let a little more time go by on just a diet of naturally gluten free foods before I start trying substitute foods for the wheat foods I used to love, but I swear I cried a little bit when I ate these pancakes.  Because I thought they sucked, frankly.  They are completely bland and have no flavor at ALL, and the texture was reminiscent of wallpaper paste. (I don't know if that's gluten free but if so it's probably cheaper to just put some syrup on that and eat it!) After letting the batter stand 10 minutes to thicken up a bit, it was more like kindergarten paste, but still totally flavorless.  My 2 year old daughter gobbled them up, so that's something.  Then I cried a litle bit more thinking about the fact that I guess I'll never get to teach her how to make a real, delicious fluffy wheat pancake, but that's a whole other thing.<br /><br />I'm giving it 2 stars just because it is useful for breading oven baked chicken, but you could do that more economically with another GF flour."
negative,14/10/21,"The pricing is quite a bit higher than in the grocery stores.  It is not available in all stores, but I have found it conveniently enough for my purposes."
negative,7/2/21,I am giving this two stars as my family didnt mind the taste but the texture was so grainy and the biscuts fell apart easily. I was not a fan of the pancakes at all I believe they really didnt have a good flavor. Will not be wasting my money on such a tiny package either when you can but a bigger package of regular mix for less? Not fair to us with allergies in my opinion!!
negative,29/3/21,"Going gluten free is not optional for those diagnosed with celiac disease---- but eating a pizza made with a dough created with this product is optional---and definitely not recommended. I knew something was amiss when I opened the product and it was the consistency of very fine white beach sand. Putting my reservations aside, I proceeded to make pizza dough as directed on the box. Needless to say, the pizza dough was chewy and tasted very strange. I would not recommmend this product for pizza dough."

negative,10/3/21,"These sticks definitely don't look like ones in the picture.<br />They are much thinner and IMHO not worth the money. I should have returned it but instead gave my dog (GSD) 5 at a time to keep her busy.<br /><br />I'd stick with the Redbarn or equivalent from another website."
negative,10/7/21,"I just received my order of 100 count regular bully sticks and am extremely disappointed.<br />""Only ValuePetSupplies bulk Bully Sticks are hand measured for consistent thickness"". I beg to differ.<br />The ""regular"" size is quoted as 9/16"" thickness. The product I received is less than 4/16"" in thickness.<br />Out of 100 pieces, less than five actually measured up to the regular thickness advertised.<br />My blue heeler dispatched one piece in less than a minute. It usually takes him five minutes.<br /><br />On the other hand, my toy fox terrier is still working on hers and won't leave leftovers for the big guy to clean up.<br />While I understand that ValuePetSupplies.com sponsors good causes, I will be spending an extra 15 cents per piece and get a much more substantial treat."
negative,27/1/21,"I ordered these despite my concerns after reading other reviews re: small diameter size.  Absolutely true, and I regret making the purchase. For the same price, I briefly ordered from a different Amazon vendor the same # and length bully sticks for the same price.  Difference?  Original vendor bully sticks were on average 3/4"" thick.  This vendor bully sticks are at MOST 1/2"" thick, with most closer to 1/4"".<br /><br />What difference does it make?<br /><br />Our dog, a slender 44 lb. mixed boxer/chow, would take 3-5 days to get through a 3/4"" bully stick, and would get hours and hours of good gnawing time in on each one.  These new thin ones she completely consumes in less than 30 mins.  That makes a huge difference in how fast we go through the bag!<br /><br />Will not order again from this supplier."
negative,1/6/21,"Apparently 'regular' size = thinner than standard-sized pencils =(  My chihuahuas finish these in a matter of minutes, when it normally takes them days to consume a thicker bully stick."
negative,20/8/21,"I have used this mix for years for yellow pound cake and everyone seems to love it.  I'm still able to purchase the 18oz. at my local grocery.  I was going to order this product, but saw that it was 16.5 oz. and was afraid it wouldn't go with the old Duncan Hines pound cake recipe.  Hope these companies realize the damage they are doing to time proven recipes when they downsize their products."
negative,14/8/21,"In the past I was able to make so many different cakes using this cake mix. I made 2 rum cakes today thinking I had done something wrong when the first one didn't turn out as usual. I now realize I didn't do anything wrong,Duncan Hines did something wrong by reducing the size of their product; I would gladly have paid more for the larger mix. Now I will never buy another Dunkin Hines Mix!!!!! How dumb do you think we are."
negative,21/4/21,"Duncan Hines used to be my favorite line of cake mixes. I bought them all of the time. But now they, like Betty Crocker, have downsized their packages of cake mix. These new mixes will not work with older recipes, that called for the 18.25 ounce size of cake mix. That rules out a lot of our favorite cakes. Even a plain cake will be changed - it won't bake up as high or as big in the pan. Duncan Hines just lost me as a customer.<br /><br />Pillsbury has not reduced their cake mix sizes (at least, not yet). I will be buying them. If they shrink in size, I will bake from scratch."
negative,1/4/21,"I have bought Duncan Hines Yellow cake mix in the past and have made a favorite recipe with it.  In the past, it had 18.25 ounces.  Pillsbury and Betty Crocker have the required ounces 18+.  I bought Duncan Hines at Safeway because it was less expensive than the other brands and after I got home, I discovered why.  I will not buy Duncan Hines again unless they go back to the 18+ ounces or go to 9 ounces for $.54.  Consumer beware and read the number of ounces in the product."

negative,17/4/21,"I purchased 6 boxes as gifts at $21 per box.  I spent over $120.00 and none could be used.  Every piece was broken and could not be used for the Seder.  Sending a gift that is broken and can't be used is very embarrassing.  Also the return window is April 18th which is ridiculous since the matzo was for the first Seder which was on April 18th at night."
negative,10/3/21,"Trader Joe's Pomegranate White tea is superior to this tea. This is very bitter and perfumey. Maybe thats what you get when you brew whole leaves and stems . I found it repulsive."
negative,30/5/21,"Some reviewers say the coffee is bitter- I like bitter but I didn't like this. It wasn't a good bitter taste, it was a ""cringe"" kind of taste.<br /><br />I drink one of the strongest coffee's out there and this was too much for me. The strange taste of it turned me off...<br />I once owned a coffee pot by Melitta too, and it took a cone shaped special filter. I wasn't impressed with that either.<br /><br />Maybe i'm just not big on Arabica coffee or whatever it is but the taste was unpleasant to me. Not smooth. Bitter yes, but not smooth.<br /><br />It smells ok. I agree with Charlie ( another Amazon Reviewer) who said the package was difficult to open. It was sealed extremely tight and when you did eventually get it open, the bag tore apart.<br /><br />No way would I spend 20 bucks for this. If i was addicted to it, possibly, but even then that's steep. And I surely won't buy this in the future.<br /><br />You can go down to the local ""name of popular coffee shop here"" and get 2 bags for this price of FRESHLY ground coffee.<br /><br />Melitta makes it sound like it's the greatest thing since sliced bread on their package. Gourmet, Swiss water process, from Europe's charming sidewalk cafe's, top quality hand- picked beans..<br /><br />If you want to pay this kind of money and like Melitta coffee, then get it, but I don't think it's anything special."
negative,28/9/21,"The initial aroma upon opening the package was decent, though subtle. Unfortunately, it quickly dissipated - I really couldn't smell anything after a minute, which I assume is due to it being pre-ground.<br /><br />I brewed this coffee in a French press as well as in a drip brewer. Both results tasted flat and boring, although there was a decent amount of body - at least it was inoffensive. Perhaps a notch up from bad diner coffee. For about the same price, you could get better tasting fresher beans from a cafe or natural foods store."
negative,6/5/21,"I've read lots of other reviews deeming this tea as ""coffee tasting"" or with ""roasted flavors,"" but to be very truthful, it tastes just the way I could imagine second hand smoke would. It's very very strong, requires 15 minutes to steep, and is not for the faint hearted. I've heard wonderful reviews related to weight loss regarding this product, but I was not able to tolerate the taste long enough to actually see any weight loss benefits. Good luck to those who care to brave this ""roasted"" flavor."
negative,20/4/21,"This was the worst tasting tea, actually the worst tasting anything, that I have ever consumed. I took one sip and could not bring myself to finish the cup. It tasted like dirt, which makes sense since it is a root. The rest of the tea bags are going in the trash."
negative,20/4/21,"First, let me state that I brew most of my tea in a gaiwan, hence, I use loose leaf tea.<br /><br />White tea is one of my favorites so I'm always on the lookout for a nicely priced Bai Mudan.<br /><br />As much as I love Bai Hao Yinzhen, I just cannot afford to drink it exclusively due to the volume of white tea I drink.<br /><br />I thought this was a pretty good price and when I opened it up it didn't look too bad either.  Much to my surprise, after taking the first layer off the top (I transfer my tea to good tea tins) it was nearly all powder/dust with hardly any intact leaves.  This is extremely problematic if you don't use any filters or screens (like me).  I don't mind when some tea leaves get in my tea and it is pretty much normal if you don't pour through a screen, however, this was so broken up that it was just unworkable.<br /><br />I have only opened one bag at this point so there is a chance that it was just that bag or possibly even a bad batch but at this point I most likely won't be ordering it again.<br /><br />That being said, the whole leaves that were there (on the top) looked fine.  It does have a bit of a green tea taste (vs some other high quality white tea I am used to), however, it isn't bad or anything.  Definitely drinkable on a regular basis if the bag wasn't mostly powder.<br /><br />I took a couple pics so I will post them...keep in mind this came in two pouches, I poured into tins and that is where I took the pictures (the product does not actually come in tins)."
negative,21/4/21,"I also bought two of these as gifts, and will be returning them for the same reason as some of the others.  Unacceptable packaging!  Unless you have already tried the product, there is nothing about this that makes you want to try it.  I assumed (big mistake!) that there would be some kind of packaging, but there was not.  This is really sad too, because the product is great."
negative,2/5/21,"I purchased this as a present but it doesn't come As shown in the picture.  It is little white bags with the flavor written on them.  Someone receiving it as a gift wouldn't even know what it was unless I explained it to them. Will be returning."
negative,18/12/19,"After reading all the great reviews, I optimistically ordered some of this tea. I've had problems with sinus congestion very often this winter and have tried all kinds of remedies with little success.  Unfortunately, this really didn't do anything for me.  The taste is OK (bearable), but it did nothing to relieve my sinus congestion.  (So far the only things I've found that have helped me somewhat are the Vicks personal warm mist humidifier and Neti Xlear)"
negative,19/1/20,"This tea didn't do anything, steal have issues with itching throat, ear and everything else. But I do enjoy the smell of it.. ill say it last up to a few hours and that's it."
negative,19/1/20,"I had high hopes when I purchased this produce, shipping was amazingly fast and I've tried it a few times. I don't enjoy the taste, and since I don't sweeten my tea, it wasn't that great, and it did nothing for my sinuses. Will not purchase again but I do recommend the seller."
negative,31/3/20,"I bought this tea during a major sinus infection crisis which included headache, earache, toothache. I drink multiple cups over a few days, and am sad to report it had absolutely no effect. Taste is so-so, but that's not really what matters. As every sinus sufferer knows, if eating dirt would make the pain go away, we'd eat dirt."
negative,18/12/19,"I have ordered numerous teas, potions, lotions and other remedies...BUT have never had a lack of product in an order that was sealed.  The tea bag wrapping in question was sealed without a tea bag inside.  I would have said something sooner, however...I only tried these when I had a sinus infection and the last 3 times I tried to use one...the sealed pouch was EMPTY.  BEWARE!"
negative,13/10/19,"All natural beef, but too soft for my taste - doesn't have the 'snap' and drier outer surface that some like.  This is a matter of personal taste - the product is good, just not for everyone.<br />I suggest trying this company's old fashioned cold-smoked beef-sticks.  Strong hickory flavor, a good bite of spice, and drier texture.<br />This company has superb customer service!"
negative,28/9/20,"I couldn't resist the price... so many beef sticks for so cheap. However, I think I was expecting something different. The jerky has a good taste, and at first it wasn't very oily, but as they got older (and exposed to the air) I did notice some oil spots forming through the casings of the sticks. Overall, if you can consume this, say, within 1 week of opening, they are great! If you need something that will stick around longer (stick, get it?) then maybe this isn't the right product. They also sent me a free sample of some of their other products with my order, and the shipping was quick. I like the company, the beef sticks just weren't what I was looking for, I guess."
negative,16/11/20,"I guess it does the job okay.  And it's much cheaper than 5-Hour brand.  But the packaging it arrived in was in Spanish.  Since I don't speak or read Spanish I was a little leery of this item since it was impossible for me to read ingredients and nutritional information panel.<br />The item is labelled as being made in the USA but the website on the label has a .mx extension for being a Mexican company.<br />I don't have anything against our neighbors to the south.  I just expect that when I buy something on Amazon that the labeling will be in English unless otherwise stated."
negative,27/2/20,"I took a chance with this product (even though there weren't enough good reviews) since they are cheaper than 5 hour energy.  They did not work for me so I tried Red Rain which did work and was even cheaper.  Red Rain DID work for me so I am done with 5 hour energy and 6 hour power. The ingredients are pretty close to 5 hour energy but someone is lying since it doesn't work."
negative,26/2/21,"I've tried a few of the different energy shots, and found that the ""5 hour energy"" have a flowery note (lavender?) in all of their flavours.<br /><br />I can't say I like it. The _effect_ is ok, but the flavour is like bad/flat orange pop, and is otherwise uninspiring. I think I'd prefer the more standard 'berry' flavour of other shots vs this one."
negative,18/12/19,"I had to be taken to the ER in an ambulance earlier, the day before yesterday. I was having seizures, near-syncope (passing out, but still being somewhat conscious), couldn't breathe, and my blood pressure was at stroke level. I felt like and thought I was dying (or maybe already) dead for about 3 hours. It was painful and horrifying. I think I figured out what it was that caused my near-death experience. It was probably the energy-shot I took 20 minutes before then. I don't usually take something like that. Someone offered it to me, and I was so tired, I didn't even look at the bottle and took it. Please, don't use these!"
negative,19/1/20,"I purchase Banh Trang Spring Rolls Skin frequently to prepare a tasty batch of fresh spring rolls, but recently I got a container with black spots mixed into the skin.  I tried to rinse them off when they were soaking but it didn't work and had to be thrown away.  At the bottom of the container, 5 skins had what looked to be tiny ants embedded within the skin.  At that point, I decided not to have fresh spring rolls at all until I purchased a fresh batch of a different brand..  When trying to find the company on the internet to write them directly, I was unable locate their company webpage, although there were many references to the Co. name Bahn Trang."

negative,28/4/21,"I love using generous amounts of vinegar on sandwiches, salads, etc., but this drink was so vinegary that I got a bit of a tummy ache.  It tasted closer to salad dressing than it did a drink.  I tried really hard to like it, but no go."
negative,12/7/21,"I bought these bars for several years at my local co-operative grocery store, and ate them daily--they are tasty. However, the price increased nearly 100% during that time, and I noticed that, although the individual wrappers within the box remained the same size, the bar within the wrapper decreased. When I stopped buying these, the actual bar was only half the size of the wrapper. That's deceptive packaging, so I refuse to buy these any more. I suspect that other shoppers likewise complained, because last month the store where I bought these stopped carrying them."
negative,18/12/19,"These aren't as good as other bars of this type. My kids won't eat them, nor will my husband. They are all fond of the Nutrigrain variety, but I thought these would be a healthier alternative."
negative,19/1/20,"Looked like a good deal, so I ordered the ground fennel, as well as 4 other spices and seasonings from this company, but was disappointed with them all. Zero flavor, not even the fragrance of the right herbs or spices when loosely sealed containers were opened. The dill smelled like dried musty grass, and the onion even worse. Ended up throwing them all away...save your money, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."

negative,18/12/19,"If one reads this products ingredients they will find that the first ingredient is cows milk, then SUGAR (diabetic maker), then milk, again. The fourth ingredient is sunflower oil, fifth ingredient is maltodextrin which is starch produced from grain containing the sugars maltose and dextrin, with the seventh ingredient being, get this, tuna fish oil. They even feature vitamin D3, which is animal derived. There are four different sugar sources in it and some artificial flavor for good measure. If we really think about what we are feeding our babies, would we use this product? I know I wouldn't. Know your food sources."

negative,3/8/20,"I felt ripped off. The photo clearly shows two bones and the price, at $8 plus, is indicative of two. I thought I was purchasing a ""bone"" packaged as two to a pack. Walmart sells identical big smoked knuckle bones for $3.50 ea. Why doesn't the photo show one bone instead of two if they are just shipping one? It wasn't worth the hassle to return the package to make my point of protest so I am doing it here.  Beartoothjoe"
negative,29/7/21,"Is that these are 60 calories per serving, however, in all honesty, I didn't make it through a full serving.<br /><br />I was excited about these, they looked like a ""grown up graham cracker"".<br /><br />First problem was the smell. They smelled like melted plastic, and something else I'd hesitate to even guess what it is, but it's bad. I bravely pulled out one small crisp, hoping that maybe it was the packaging that had the ... aroma. It was not. The crisp itself smells horrific.<br />I figured there was no way it could taste as bad as it smelled.<br />Second problem is that I was very, very wrong about that. They have a funky, chemical taste that just defies description. The aftertaste is sort of like a skunky/chewing on a plastic pen cap that went thru the wash/wet cardboard kinda taste. Seriously, it was awful.<br /><br />I tasted these about 45 minutes ago, and after drinking an entire bottle of water AND brushing my teeth, I CAN STILL TASTE IT.<br /><br />I'm glad these were an add-on, but they are still absolutely terrible. Their only redeeming quality is that they are cute. Not one single member of my family will actually eat them though, so this was definitely a waste of 3$. Had I known they would be this awful, I'd have just got a second bag of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007POA158"">Hi I'm Skinny Sticks, Sweet Onion Multigrain, 7-Ounce</a>.<br />Only 30 cent more than these, but MILES better in taste."
negative,8/7/20,"Tortilla soup is one of my favorite soups, and I like both the tomato and chicken broth varieties. Although I didn't expect freshly fried tortilla strips or queso fresco in a canned soup, I did expect something that resembled all other tortilla soups I have tried, that is a LIGHT broth with a mix of vegetables, corn, beans chicken and Mexican spices. This soup is thick - really thick, like the thickest tomato soup you've ever had with a grilled cheese sandwich. It's also sweet, and does not taste in the least like a Mexican soup. Instead, imagine straight tomato soup with a bunch of vegetables, beans and some chicken thrown in.<br /><br />I ended up giving it all away, and, to be fair, one of the people I gave the soup to said her husband really liked it.<br /><br />For a canned soup that much more closely resembles real tortilla soup, try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014EUB7I"">Campbell's Select Mexican Chicken Tortilla, 18.6-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>."
negative,13/4/21,"Coconut water should not be sweetened!!! Actually ""NO SUGAR SHOULD EVER BE ADDED"" sweeting things is an american custom, which ruins the real flavor of coconut water. I lived in Jamaica for 4 years and the bahamas for 2, and the coconut water from real coconut does not have any added sugar, its natural.<br />I will stick to buying the brown hard shell coconuts from the supermarket and drink that it's more natural and unaltered. These boxed, caned and packaged coconut water are nasty, i am still yet to try a brand, one of the many that i have tried that will make me wanna buy it."

I dont know what World Harbors is thinking, cause this stuff<br />is horrible.<br /><br />BTW, I like their Teriyaki sauce, but this..... its as bad as it gets."
negative,18/12/19,"I wanted to love this because I LOVE Earl Grey tea, I NEED decaf and I ADORE the convenience of the Keurig.  Unfortunately, I don't love these.  The flavor is very weak and doesn't deliver on the aroma.  I typically use the large cup setting on the 3-size model, but even the small cup is wimpy with these.  I did find that mixing this one with a stronger-flavored decaf tea results in a more suitable strength, but then you have to make 2 cups of something. The English Breakfast decaf is a much better choice."
negative,19/1/20,"This slop has the color and consistency of baby diarrhea with whole peas in it. Our cat ate less than half a bowl of this slop and immediately puked all over the carpet!<br /><br />She devours the Felidae Platinum, (which we feed as an occasional alternative to Newman's Own Turkey). She was raised on Felidae dry, so I can say that generally the Canidae Company provides quality products... except for this grain-free slop. You can find the good stuff at: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFL09S"">Felidae Canned Cat Food for Senior and Overweight Cats, Platinum Diet Formula (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)</a><br /><br />Absolutely do not order this slop from Amazon because they will charge you $10.70 for the privilege of returning the 11 cans your cat will not eat. Before you make the same stupid mistake I did, buy a can from your local pet food store and try it out first. Then, when your cat pukes this slop back up, you will only be out $1.59 instead of the $27.94 Amazon nailed me.<br /><br />In my opinion, your cat and you will be much better off with Newman's Own Organic cat food, especially the turkey and chicken. The Newman food literally brought our cat back from the brink of death! After we listened to our former vet and fed her Science Diet K/D, she dropped down to less than 4 pounds in a month. We switched her back to Newman's Own Turkey and within one 24-case of small cans she was back up to her usual weight of 6.2lbs, and has maintained that healthy weight for over 6 months. She also gained increased mobility after we stopped feeding her the K/D. I read somewhere that Science Diet buys veterinary students their books in exchange for their later recommendations of their products. Nice.<br /><br />Just say NO to Science Diet and Felidae Grain Free Formula. Here's the good stuff: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK8HJ0"">Newman's Own Organics Turkey & Vegetable Formula for Cats, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br /><br />(Did they really want me to post a video with this review?

negative,14/10/20,"I've been feeding Wellness grain-free for a while now and all three of them love it. I ordered the Felidae last time because the Wellness was no longer eligible for free shipping and the Felidae was - which makes the difference between whether it is a better deal to order it or buy it at Petco brick and mortar....None of my cats will eat it. They actually at NOTHING for the past 2 days since the only thing offered them was the Felidae. I broke down today and gave them a back-up can of 9-Lives grain free and they are happily curled up and purring now. I think Felidae is a high quality food and I only feed the lower quality grain-free food on rare occasion, but the rest of this case will be donated to my local shelter. Hopefully, something there will like it. I'm off for the trip to Petco for the Wellness."
negative,10/3/21,"I was really hoping this grain free canned cat food will work for my 3 cats; looks like it has good ingredients but none of my 3 cats will eat it. In fact one of them will smell it and start doing the scratching thing like he smells poop. Another weird thing is the whole can is kind of soft and meshed like baby food but there are some whole green peas in it, not sure if that is by design or some green peas escape the meshing."

negative,14/7/20,"Look at the ingredients...it is made with Black Tea...Google Black tea and Fluoride and you will see that black tea is LOADED with fluoride because it is made with the oldest part of the tea plant it contains the highest level of fluoride of any tea. Fluoride is not healthy for anyone. If you want a healthy natural tea, get one that is made with white tea leaves. White tea leaves still have all the beneficial antioxidant properties but much, much , much less fluoride than either black or green teas."

These nuts were chewy, not crunchy, and the chocolate coating was a bit mealy.<br />If you know anything about dark chocolate, and like yours with some snap, don't order these.<br /><br />Actually, the best dark chocolate covered walnuts are called Perigord and are available through a Canadian company called Kis Global.<br />They are sun dried, super crispy, covered in a fairly thin shell of 70% dark chocolate, and dusted with unsweetened cocoa.<br />Very adult and superb."

negative,9/7/21,This is my 2nd review for this product.  The first one was supposed to be 75 words.  That would be too long for this item.  The product itself is good but the price for shipping for such a small item was ridiculous.  The package was small and light weight but I was charged $6.78 for shipping of a $4.99 item.  I have bought many items from amazon.com and it seems here lately that the shipping has gotten totally out of hand. I bought several items and the shipping was all together.  Therefore I did not know how much was charged for each item. I will not buy from this vendor again since they are making money on the shipping.  Enough said.
negative,8/7/21,"On top of the delightful aspartame, this comes complete with hydrogenated oils and is a dead ringer for Country Time Lemonade mix."
negative,15/7/21,"Instead of just being pork rinds, oil, salt and vinegar, they have lactose and maltodextrin on them, contributing to 2g of sugar per serving.  Many people (myself included) who buy this kind of snack who are on low carbohydrate diets; they will not be happy about the sugar.<br /><br />The labeling on the package is very strange, and I am surprised it gets by the nice government men who worry about this sort of thing.  It says Total Carbohydrates are less then 1g, so they get to put zero grams.  Ok, fair enough, I have seen that before.  But then the label admits to 2 grams of sugar, which is a carbohydrate.  How they can get away with saying they have zero grams of carbs when there are 2 grams of sugar is beyond me.  I assume it is just that nobody has caught them yet.<br /><br />Then there is protein.  The nutritional analysis says 8g of protein per serving.  Not bad for a snack food.  Right next to the 8g is says ""Not a significant source of protein.""  Huh...A slice of cheese is about 8 grams of protein, as is an ounce of meet.  I believe those are significant sources of protein.<br /><br />I went to their website, to check out the nutritional facts.  I did notice they were high in sodium.  What I missed was that they claim the number of servings in a 1.75 oz package was three (3), so the sodium in a package is actually three times higher.  I doubt many people expect a 1.75 oz package to be three servings.  I just looked up Fritos Corn chips.  A 2 oz package is considered a single serving package, and the analysis on the back shows one serving.  So when Fritos tells you the sodium level, it is only 320 mg for the entire package.  For these pork rinds, the 1.75 oz package is 900 mg of sodium, about half of your daily requirement.  A little steep for a snack.<br /><br />Although I went to their site to look at some nutritional info, they don't shows the label or the actual ingredients on their site or at Amazon.  If they had, I would not have purchased it.  They use partially hydrogenated oil, a kind of fat may be destructive to your health long term.  Since the government broke down and required that partially hydrogenated oil be listed on the label, a lot of the food industry has switched away from it, as people are correctly suspicious of it.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, I was unhappy with the taste.  They have a chemical, nasty taste.  I suppose that is subjective, but a few bites left me a little queasy.<br /><br />I feel bad having bought this, but perhaps my error will be of some use to others looking for a low carb snack.  Please pass this company's products by, and let's find someone else who can actually provide us the food we want and the information we need in a rational, ethical and legal way."
negative,6/7/21,"THis product (which i am not allowed to return) has ingrediants of salt, spices, hydrolysed soy protein, that last item is the common industry con for adding msg to your food. Every soup on your grocers shelf contains msg, but, i digress. So, the third ingrediant is a form of MSG, further down the ingrediant list is proudly displayed ... Monosodium Gludamate, ...MSG. This does not add spice to your food, it stimulats your tongue into feeling that the food tastes good, when IT DOES NOT. MSG can make dogfood taste like hamburger. anyone who thinks this is making their food taste cajun may be serving ALPO.  Tones and Durkee (sp) do not contain MSG, I prefer Tones!<br /><br />I have 8 eight ounce cans of this stuff.. would anybody like to buy some hamburger from me?"
negative,13/8/21,"I bought this seasoning because Amazon stopped selling the 12 count Konriko cajun seasoning so this was the one they had in a 12 count.  I bought it thinking it would be similar to the Konriko, BOY WAS I WRONG!!!<br /><br />First of all like another reviewer said some of the ingredients are as follows:  hydrolyzed soy protein, and Partially hydrogenated cottonseed and soy bean oil.  I was completely stumped as to why these two ingredients were necessary in a spice blend mix.  Now I know why with the hydrolyzed soy protein; as the other reviewer stated it's a industry way of adding MSG.  Well why in the world do we need that and what's up with the HYDROGENATED SOY BEAN AND COTTONSEED OIL!!!!  BESIDE IT BEING BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH IT CAUSES THE PRODUCT TO CAKE AND CLUMP.  I steer clear of products with hydrogenated oils in them.  An even though this may not have many trans fat an accumulation over time is what makes this deceptively bad for your health.  When I purchased this last year they did not have the ingredients listed in the description, now it is.  I think that AMAZON as a regular practice should require all food products/company's to list the ingredients of their product to sell on their site.  WHY WAIT UNTIL THE CUSTOMER PURCHASE IT TO FIND OUT???!!!  I don't think this is a customer friendly practice!!!!<br /><br />Not a good buy IMO.  I found my Konriko at another site and will be purchasing it from there; unless AMAZON brings it back at a 12 count offer; otherwise to buy one at $8 and $4.99 s/h is just way over priced and highway robbery!!!!"
negative,5/6/21,"I agree with a previous reviewer - when it comes to the dinners (just about all of the Earth's Best choices) they are watery and SWEET.  Apples (or some other fruit) in just about everything, and the first ingredient is nearly always water.  I've decided to stay away from these as much as possible and purchase protein-containing dinners from another jarred brand (or mixing my own).  I'd really rather not nurture a sweet tooth at such a young age!<br /><br />The Earth's Best fruits and vegetables for the most part are great - just check the label to make sure water isn't the first ingredient listed (I just love how baby food will have water listed first but then some kind of flour added as well to thicken it up)."
negative,9/7/21,"As I have with all other Earth's Best jarred baby food, I won't be purchasing these Dinners for my baby because the jar lids contain BPA.  I contacted Earth's Best's consumer relations dept. personally, and the representative read me a prepared statement saying that the epoxy resin that lines Earth's Best baby food jar lids contains ""trace amounts"" of BPA, but it ""doesn't come into direct contact with the food.""  That kind of lukewarm response wasn't enough to put my concerns about BPA to rest ... after all, packaged food is jostled-around so much during shipping that these jars could spend days upside down, with the food resting directly on the jar lids.  So I guess I'll have to pass on these jarred Dinners for now.  (The Earth's Best rep did say that they were doing ""accelerated testing"" of BPA-free alternatives for lining their baby food jars).<br /><br />This is such a shame, because Earth's Best is the only company that makes organic, pre-packaged Stage 2 complete meals (e.g., with meat/protein, veggies & carbs/starch) in PUREE form.  All the other organic baby food manufacturers, such as Plum, Sprout, Ella's Kitchen, etc., only make Stage 3 meals, in chunky form.  Earth's Best does make some baby food in BPA-free squeeze pouches, but that doesn't include its Dinner line.  I was hoping to be able to expose my little-one to a wider variety of flavors and well-balanced meals while still at the puree stage.  But I guess I'll have to wait until she's old enough for Stage 3 chunky meals, or make her baby food myself.  (Virtually impossible for this super-busy and domestically-challenged mom, LOL!)"

negative,9/7/21,"I was disappointed to find out that the LIDS of Earth's Best jarred foods are coated with an epoxy lining that contains BPA :(<br />I thought I was avoiding the whole BPA issue because these are in glass rather than plastic containers. If it's in the lids, it's going to get in the food as the food moves around in the jar during packaging, shipping, storage, etc. I was planning on being a devoted Earth's Best jarred food user because it was organic and in glass, but then I found out about the BPA. As a note, if BPA doesn't bother you, most of Earth's Best food is tasty."

Of course there is old stock on the shelves so I asked how to tell whether the liners we have are the ""old"" (with BPA) or the ""new"" (without BPA) and the person there said to look at the inside the surface of the lid. If it is all white then it is BPA free - if it is metallic or gold then it's the ""old"" lids which did contain a BPA layer. Thought this might help some of you out there!"
negative,10/10/21,I ordered this because I really like this brand and I have never had any issue with them.  My son usually like all the flavors.  I ordered this and the pears were sour/spoiled.

negative,29/9/21,"I just called up customer service and found that since October 2011, all the jars are BPA free. BUT...the jars manufactured before October,2011 are still available in the market. Usually all these products have a long shelf life as they are vacuum sealed. So the jars with BPA lining on the lids are still floating around in the market. The consumers cannot tell the difference. So what is the point in buying this when you do not know if you are giving your baby something that is BPA free or not??? This is very very disappointing from earth's best."
negative,11/9/21,"I usually feed Earth's Best baby food to my grandson. He has never had a reaction of any kind to any baby food I have given him. This is the first time I have tried this particular variety pack. I fed him the Peach Oatmeal Banana and Apples and Apricots for breakfast this morning. Shortly after I noticed he was scratching. I looked and he had a rash. I remembered reading a baby food review where someone mentioned an allergy so I checked and yes it is this variety pack. I don't know what is in it that would cause this type of reaction. Unfortunately I fed him two different jars so I don't know which one caused it but I don't want to take a chance of him having another one so out they go. Just thought I would let others know."

So yeah all in all pretty flavorless (beside the dirty water smell taste). Was a huge disappointment. Worse yet I bought 2-12 pk cases. Now I have to doctor the rest up.

I added about half the bottle to the cake mix (white cake--NOT vanilla), and the other half to the frosting (white frosting--NOT vanilla) and it still only had a HINT of blueberry flavor.  I was completely disappointed in all the time, effort and money spent making it, and it barely tasted blueberry.  I would have thought that using the WHOLE bottle would have made a blueberry flavor.  I guess I will have to see if I can find actual blueberry extract and not blueberry FLAVORED extract.  Will not be wasting my money on this again.  :("
negative,15/9/21,"Something is Very Wrong  The product is excellent.  I have been buying it for several years, first at Whole Foods, and then when they dropped the product, I have been purchasing it online.  In fact, I purchased it in its original larger size jar.  When the size was decreased to 8.82 OZ,  the selling price remained the same at Whole Foods.  I also purchased ALL flavors as this product is really delicious.<br /><br />The price has been going up CONSIDERABLY. I purchase 36 jars per order to save on shipping. With each order there is always another price increase.<br /><br />My recent order of September 2012 for 36 jars was apparently packed at the warehouse and sent to the store. The store did not repack it. Each box of six was sealed with warehouse tape identifying the item. It stated the name of the store it was shipped to as well as the flavor. The following information shocked me, and I quote:<br /><br />RIGONI FRUIT SPRD 8.82 OZ Pack 6 Retail 5.99<br /><br />Did you note the price? Retail 5.99!!!! It did not state wholesale, it said RETAIL PRICE. No one sells it for 5.99, yet the warehouse stipulates that is the retail price. Am I missing something here?  How many hundreds of dollars have I wasted???  I guess it is a matter of what the market will bear.....OUTRAGEOUS!  Of course there is the additional shipping chg.  On principal alone I will give up on this product. The GREED is beyond comprehension.<br /><br />I gave the product a low rating, even though the product is excellent because it is incredibly OVERPRICED."

negative,28/7/20,"This was my first experience of a bad Darjeeling - before, I hadn't known there was such a thing. The first brew yielded a dark rust color tinged with olive-green. The bottom of the cup was invisible. The taste was sharp and astringent. Thinking I'd brewed too long or too strong, I set the first cup aside and tried again. And then again. A light brew of 3 minutes improved the clarity; however, nothing I have tried since has removed a level of astringency and a furred taste that I associate with lesser teas. The wet leaves are the typical size, light brown but unexpectedly interspersed with limp green squares.  The aroma of dry tea in the bag reminds me of old hay - neither moldy nor spoiled, just old. In contrast, the Davidson's Keemun Conjou which arrived in the same shipment smells and tastes like delicious Keemun Conjou and nothing else.<br /><br />Given the price, I knew I was gamboling and consider this a lost bet. I have given the product two stars instead of one, because I haven't thrown it out (yet). I keep a supply of Lipton's bulk tea for emergencies such as long periods of unemployment, and I don't really need more emergency tea. Perhaps it will work for iced tea.<br /><br />By no means am I an expert, but I do value tea, and so I hope this opinion helps other buyers who are trying to decide between two Darjeelings. Davidson's ships quickly with value pricing, and so I am not giving up on the merchant. Just on this particular Darjeeling."

I decided to try Spicy World Vanilla Beans rather than the much more expensive vanilla beans from Williams Sonoma.  Two vanilla beans from Williams Sonoma in a pint of vodka resulted in a very dark richly aromatic vanilla after only two months.  I used three Spicy World vanilla beans in a pint of vodka and after two months I had a liquid that looked like weak tea and had the aroma of alcohol.  I added three more beans and waited.  The results were disappointing, so I added three more vanilla beans.  You can still see through the vanilla and it doesn't have the aroma of vanilla.  I am completely disappointed with the vanilla beans from Spicy World.  They are totally worthless, a complete waste of money.  I would not recommend them or purchase anything from Spicy World."
negative,28/7/20,"I purchased these beans based on other reviews.  My plan was to make a Premium Vanilla Extract for family members.

The beans arrived after the 4th, and I rushed to open the package.  I could not smell the beans as others reported!  Most of the beans were skinny/shriveled, more dry, and a great disappointment.  I Would Not recommend this product.  I will be looking for another source."
negative,13/5/20,"This product had pretty good reviews so I thought it would be safe to buy 4 packages, so I did. Boy am I full of regret now. I'm stuck with 4 packs of these beans and I can't return any them. The moment I opened the bag, I should've known. It had a stale sour smell to them. But the optimistic side of me said, these beans look fresh and plump, maybe it won't smell like that once I scrape the seeds out. I was wrong. I made two test batches to see if it was the salt I was using to make my vanilla salt but they both have that weird sour, rancid smell. I've made vanilla salt before so I know what it's supposed to smell and taste like. Unfortunately, even after a few days, this smell isn't going away. I was really looking forward to making jars of vanilla salt to give out as cheap gifts. But now I need to go buy more vanilla beans to replace these which is going to end up costing me. I'm so disappointed. I haven't cooked with these seeds so I don't know if the taste and smell transforms with heat or with any other mixed in ingredient. I know for sure though that if you're looking to make vanilla extract, vanilla sugar or vanilla salt, I HIGHLY discourage you from buying this product."
negative,26/3/21,"True, the beans were huge, moist and plump, with a good mixture of really big fat ones and smaller skinny ones.

I thought they had gotten better and decided to give them another try.  What a  mistake.  Never again.  Customer service at Amazon leaves much to be desired, as well.  IF you get someone, they'll probably speak broken English and be very hard to understand.  Then they will not understand the problem.  You'll have to ask for a supervisor who, you hope, will speak better English.  Be prepared to wait a LONG time for a supervisor, and you may be disconnected several times before actually getting through to a supervisor.

negative,1/3/20,"I also ordered a flat of food (they were on sale) that contained The Turkey and Wild Rice Dinner.  One of them was also improperly sealed; the lid popped.  We were lucky because I just happened to check that one.  Now I'm so paranoid that I check all of them several times.  I called Earth's Best and they assured me that they haven't had this problem before and that I shouldn't worry about it.  I'm so suprised that this got passed QA/QC inspection at a baby food manufacturer.  Why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety?!"
negative,28/7/20,"My daughter thinks this tastes nasty, and I agree. She is sensitive to carrot, so I was looking for a food for travel that delivers protein but doesn't contain carrot. Though she eats homemade turkey and peas all the time, she wouldn't even take a full bite of this. I tasted a little bit, and I can see why."
negative,13/6/20,"This was NOT a hit!  It's bitter, like maybe the carrots were not sweet and/or not peeled?  and the main ingredient is carrots! (amazon should include the ingredients for all items) Quality control seems to be an issue. This is the second ""gourmet meal"" flavor with this issue. I had never had a bad experience with the EB products before, very disappointing."
negative,10/3/20,"My girls seem to like this food - they've only ever shown an opposition to green beans.  But it is SO messy.  It's apparently tomato-based, and it gets everywhere.  Where we usually just wipe their faces gently, you really have to clean them.  It simply turns their skin orange.  And the bowls and spoon end up crazy oily, even after soaking."
negative,9/5/20,"My 9 mo. old daughter only eats earth's best products and loves all of them - that is, except this. I can't figure out what it is, but we finally concluded that it smells a little like catfood. I tried feeding her this mango chicken flavor a few different times and she would only eat a few bites. I gave up and donated the rest to the food bank hoping someone else's child would like it. I have had a good experience with the ""subscribe and save"" products in general, no broken jars and the quick delivery is great. I find that it is cheaper than whole foods (even with the coupons). This is the only flavor of earth's best baby food that my daughter dislikes. For what it's worth, I suggest skipping this one or trying it in a variety pack first."
negative,14/5/19,It was bad before we open them. I saw them when we got. I did open. It had some spot green color. I did not know what it was. I was very upset. Do not buy this product.

negative,28/7/20,I am big coffee lover.  This was some of the worst coffee I have ever had.  It smells wonderful but the taste is horrible.  I would not recommend purchasing this coffee at all.
negative,7/3/20,"Several of the seller's listings indicate 20% Kona blend.....but the delivered product does NOT have this package printing.<br />As a long-time Kona coffee drinker, the contents are more indicative of 10% (or less) Kona coffee. Have ordered twice....and completely disappointed."
negative,4/8/20,You have to put a lot of sugar in  this to make it taste good. The coffee just by itself kind if has a stinky smell like a poopy diaper or a pee pee poo poo puppy in a cup. Next time I am going for raspberry flavored coffee...cause the chocolate is like poop. YUCK.
negative,26/12/19,"I bought this bag and found it 50% cheaper at smart and final. It was also old and and white. This was terrible! I bought it to put in the candy canisters I give to co-workers. So I didn't find out it was OLD till a co-worker informed me. I was so embarrassed. Do not buy this candy. It all ended up in the trash. Very disappointed!"
negative,28/3/21,"This candy was obviously old. Each chocolate was discolored. The Krackel krispies were not crispy and the chocolate wasn't right. Peant butter cups and Goodbars nasty, the nuts are horrible. Hersheys pulls their candy off of the shelves in the stores when it is getting old. Seller must have bought it up & sold it here last year or the year before. It has to be at least 1 or more years old. Do not buy chocolate from ZANY Values, it isn't good for you!!<br /><br />I'm sure that if the candy were FRESH that it would have been just fine. I have re-ordered from a different vendor and will let you know if theirs is fresh (as it should be) or not."
negative,6/2/20,"I don't know what all the positive reviewers here are raving about. I tried Ghiraradelli's premium cocoa mix and found it much too sweet that it was almost unpalatable. And not a very chocolatey taste either. The directions given for one serving are 4 Tbsp of the powder to 8 oz of milk.  Did they meant 4 tsp?  Using their directions would yield a total of 8 cups of hot cocoa -- not very economical for a product with so much sugar.  I had high hopes for this product but was very disappointed."
negative,25/4/21,"Very bitter!  I couldn't taste the coffee at all.  It basically tastes like baking cocoa.  No sweetness, no richness, not coffee.  I bought the 4 pack though, so I've begun mixing it half and half with Swiss Miss (in the can), and then sprinkling it with instant coffee after I've made a cup.  Even making it with whole milk couldn't make this yummy by itself.  If you like a rich chocolate taste with just a bit of coffee.... shop elsewhere."
negative,3/8/20,"I love hot cocoa and hot chocolate... and have tried many different brands.<br /><br />GHIRADELLI is by far the worst that I have ever tasted!  I honestly don't have any idea how they ever became famous for their hot cocoa.<br /><br />This cocoa has an awful, stale taste... and you can tell that it is made of cheap ingredients.<br /><br />It even tastes worse than the much lower-cost brands like Swiss Miss and Nestle.<br /><br />If you want a REAL hot chocolate, look up MARIE BELLE.  It is thick and rich... not weirdly processed garbage like GHIRADELLI!!!"
negative,15/4/19,"Not really sure what I expected, but since I like Ghirardelli chocolate, and I like hot chocolate and hot mochas from coffee shops, I thought I'd like this product.<br /><br />Unfortunately, despite following the directions and making this in milk, it's not as rich and satifying as I hoped.  I hate to say it, but I think Swiss Miss mixed Instant coffee tastes better than this.<br /><br />That's unfortunate, because this is a four pack of cannisters and I'm only half way through the first one!"
negative,9/3/18,"I only use C&H Bakers Sugar for all my baking needs and I go through it FAST with a lot of baking. I looked on Amazon to see if I could purchase it in a case for ease and cost savings. At the grocery store, one 4lb carton costs less than $5, so to get three of them, it would cost $15 or less. Here on Amazon it is $28 PLUS $12 shipping. That totals $40 for a $15 product. Yep, that's almost 3 times more expensive than if I just purchase it at the local grocery store. I love Amazon and was really shocked to see this price. This is a definite NO THANKS, I know better than to purchase this item here!"
negative,18/5/18,"Too soft: I just used this sugar to bake one of the layers for a firm pound cake-like layer cake intended for decoration (Wilton Butter cake recipe). This is a pretty hardy cake and can stand up to changes in temperature etc and still turn out well. I had already baked several of the layers with regular granulated sugar before I ran out and decided to use some of this baking sugar. Be forewarned, this sugar makes cakes far too tender. The layer literally fell apart coming out of the pan and it was well cooled and in a pan liberally covered in cake release. Even when I was mixing the batter, it for some reason stuck to my stainless bowl and was impossible to scrape entirely out. I'm sure this is good for meringues and such, but I would never attempt to use it again for a cake or even cookies. You would never get them out of or off the pan."
negative,9/3/18,"The seeds are fresh, the shells are hard and the seeds are JUMBO sized.  The taste is good, but the over-powering amount of salt ruins the experience.  The 'ranch' flavor would be much tastier if the salt used were lessened.  Then again, without the overwhelming amount of salt, David might have to use a bit more of the flavor for which you are actually paying.  By the way, I don't often find items too salty, but this borders on the ridiculous, IMO.  I wholeheartedly endorse the Jumbo size seeds, as they are MUCH more enjoyable than the puny 'regular' sized sunflower seeds by David.<br /><br />I will be buying another brand of sunflower seeds in the future, hoping that it will not have the amount of salt the David's have.<br /><br />Update: I finished all but a little of the case of David buffalo ranch flavored seeds and bought a case of the Jumbo brand ranch flavored sunflower seeds.  I compared them back-to-back.  The Jumbo brand is far less salty and flavorful compared to David's.  It will be interesting how I will find the Jumbo brand to be after eating them for awhile.  Right now, they seem a bit 'under-flavored'.  Still, that is preferable to David's overuse of salt."
negative,27/2/18,"The product is a good value for the amount you get, however it is way too salty.  The product is very dry and firm.  I think this would be good if they cut the salt content in half."
negative,20/2/18,"I'm really disappointed with the changes in quality -- it's not even the same product that we used to love.  A couple of years ago, the product was consistently fantastic, but now the taste, quality of the meat, and freshness are hit or miss...and recently it's all been a miss."
negative,22/3/18,"I read the reviews and thought, I like salt. I thought the saltiness was on the exterior of the jerky.  There is very little salt taste on the outside of the jerky but the saltiness comes out with every chew. The strips are about the size of a chopstick or a very thin pencil. 12 ounces for $20+ is way too expensive.  There is very little beef flavor but too be fair it is probably covered up by the salt.  These taste very similar to the chopped and formed cheap jerky at the convenience mart that you swear you will never buy again but much more salty. The amount of salt made my tongue numb, if you want good jerky keep looking. (Jack Link's Smokehouse Beef jerky strips, wood smoked 30-count jar)"
negative,12/3/18,"The Jack Link's 30 Jerky Strips were verrrryyyy SKINNY! Some were only about 1/8 inch wide and counted as one strip. If I had known this, I would NOT have ordered the beef jerky strips - tasty, but totally not worth the money!!!!"
negative,9/2/18,"too salty -- enough said. I order the wood smoked 30-count jar. Remember, the price is for only ONE JAR (not two)."
negative,7/12/17,"I like almost everything about this jerky, the toughness and chewiness. But it is just too salty. If you nibble it, you may enjoy it but that is not how i eat. Also, it is not good for my health to eat something this salty. I have run into too many of salty beef jerky patches recently. This review is for the wood smoked, but if other flavors contains the same amount of salt per serving, they will be just as salty. Why everything is either too fatty, sweet or salty??? Are they trying to get us addicted?"
negative,24/5/19,"I buy jerky all the time, always willing to try something new. I've even made my own at home. I agree with the review that called these salt sticks, they are way too salty for my taste. Also, being a jerky eater for 40+ years, I eat it because i like the toughness and chewiness of jerk. But the tube I got was nearly un-chewable. I have bit into some hard jerky in my time, but jeez louise, these were literally like chewing leather, many of the strips would not yield to my super powered bite."
negative,9/3/18,"this is a good name and a good value; the texture and size of the jerky is fine,<br />but be prepared for the salt. It ruined it for me."
negative,18/5/18,Wow. The hickory smoked jerkey sticks were incredibly salty. I could not even eat half of the stick. I have had 3 different people try them and they had the same problem. They are so terrible it tastes like you are dumping salt into your mouth. Avoid these at all costs.
negative,23/3/18,"First time ordering this jerky from amazon, and I highly recommend to everyone DO NOT BUY IT! It is harder than a rock. I have bought it from other sellers not amazon, and it is much better. The experation date is not for another year, but you cannot even bite it or chew it. Horrible, I think its the worst jerky ive ever bought!"
negative,8/9/20,"I don't eat beef jerky, and I wanted to buy some for a Christmas gift.  I read all of the reviews at Amazon.com and decided that Jack Links would be the best purchase.  It came nicely packaged, but there is liquid in the packaging - a lot of it.  If you turn the packaging upside down, the movement of the liquid is obvious.  So now I have to pay to return soupy beef jerky and buy a different type.<br /><br />Three days since my original review.  Amazon cannot accept returns of food items, so it kindly replaced the beef jerky.  The replacement also has liquid in it.  It's not fat, but a liquid as described above.  This time, I'm asking for a refund."
negative,23/2/18,"I buy Jack Links Peppered Jerky every month.  I tried these as this was the first time seeing them.  Don't waste your money.  They are so tough even the kids wouldnt eat them!!  They do not taste anything like the other ""Peppered"" jerkys.  Stick with the 1 oz or the 2 oz sticks they are moist and not so much grizzle."
negative,18/7/20,"This is the worst Jerky I have ever tasted.  It is not edible, I actually gave it to my dog and he spit it out...I kid you not.  Don't buy this product unless you are a bar owner and want your customers to guzzle beers to put out the salty fire that is created when you eat a small bite of this crap!!!  I deserve a refund for buying this dog food....oh excuse me I forgot even my dog won't eat it :-)"
negative,14/6/18,I did not realize when I decided to purchase these that they were boxed and because of that I found them stale and hard.  I had previously purchased these at a local store who packaged them in plastic and they were soft and fresh.  Sorry that I could not give these a better review.
negative,2/11/18,"I haven't had a cat yet that liked this one.  It's just a little too interesting for them I think.  It smells nasty but I think it's just the taste that really gets them.  My current cat just won't touch it - he might eat a couple of bites if he's REALLY hungry, but I always wind up throwing it out.  This one is ground so if your cat likes pieces, don't try this one."
negative,14/10/18,"This says 4 pack...so I assumed like other purchases that I made that it was 4 boxes each with 4 packs. Big mistake! You only get four little pouches. Who would pay over $2 for a little squirt of applesauce? Don't make the same mistake. Buy elsewhere."
negative,6/4/20,"I honestly have to say that I just won't buy this variety. It looks bad, smells bad and I'm sure tastes bad because my cat won't touch it.  No way, no how, won't even look at it.  My other cat was the same way with this one.  It just looks like a huge ground up mess of leftovers they had at a fish market.  I'm sure some cats must like it because it's still being made, but there's other things out there much, much better than this one."
negative,9/3/18,"Instead of a black graduation cap, a top hat was sent instead.  Not great for a graduation gift!  Also, I think any buyer should be aware that by ""Godiva 4 Pack"", they mean ""4 pieces of candy""!  Very confusing description especially when you consider that the picture shows at least 5 pieces of candy! Definitely not worth the price!!"
negative,18/5/18,"Many people are buying this food believing it is safer because it is made in New Zealand. It is now made in the US by Performance Pet Products. I have been feeding this food to my cats since the recall horror of 2007 and prior to the change it was excellent food and I was thrilled with it. Since ZiwiPeak has been switched to canning in the US it has been a nightmare. Several times in the last year I have opened the food to find it is a green or blue colour. I had to return those cans because it made both my cats vomit and have loose stools. Also recently I have found large sharp bone pieces are present and very large strange chunks of greyish pink material that looks like connective tissue. I've contacted the US distributor twice but they have never replied. A batch I got this month with an expiry date of 2014 has caused severe vomiting and shedding with both cats who were previously healthy."
negative,7/3/18,My cats absolutely would not eat this food so it was a waste of money..it is just sitting in our cabinets.  I will donate it to a shelter...
negative,24/1/19,"In Christmas, 2010 I first ordered Clayton Fruit Cakes. They where great! Nice big cherries and other fruits and nuts. These were overloaded with the good stuff that makes a Fruit cake really great. So I re-ordered in Christmas of 2011. What a disappointment! I ordered 5 one pound cakes. When my order arrived, I was so excited. Yes I like fruit cake. Only too be very disappointed. Not only where the cakes void of very much fruit, unless you want too count the raisons as fruit. I will not be ordering Clayton Fruit Cakes next year. I can get the same results from a Hostess Fruit cake, and only spend $3.50, instead of close to 30 dollars for the Clayton cakes."
negative,27/2/19,"Claxton Dark Fruitcake has been a holiday tradition in our family since the mid 1950's. I ordered it directly from the company this year and when I served it at Thanksgiving, my guests and I thought I must have been fooled by a counterfeit website just claiming to sell Claxton fruitcakes.  It was at best 40% fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored ""cake"".  I emailed the company and expressed my disappointment.  After several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners, they assured me that it was the original dark recipe.<br /><br />In reading the ingredients, I noticed that corn syrup, sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the 4th ingredient.  At the very end were listed molasses, spices and 3 artificial food dyes.  High fructose corn syrup wasn't widely available until the mid 1970's to mid 1980's, so I'm not sure how it was one of the original ingredients.<br /><br />All of the people I talked to seemed to have the attitude that I was so stupid that I couldn't possibly be observing what I had correctly. Although they offered to send replacements if I returned it at my own expense, they told me that what I would receive would be identical to what I have.  One of the owners informed me that they had received zero complaints this year.<br /><br />I am grieving the loss of an almost 55 year tradition, but the other 4 cakes are now in the trash."
negative,19/4/20,"Aweful! They arrived immediately and still were as hard as cement! The bags' supposed re-sealable zipper,didn't re-seal once and maybe the large amount had something to do with it but again, I cannot believe how stale and terrible the candy inside was!"
negative,17/4/20,"... get this type of sugar any other way than through ordering it because the shipping is INSANE!  The sugar is fine but for the price of the shipping, it was not worth it."
negative,3/4/20,"I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes. For nearly the same price as this overpriced Alpo, one could buy organic dog food, free of preservatives, corn, and cheap by-products!"
negative,7/8/19,"I am celiac and have been keeping a strictly gluten-free diet for over six years, and was excited to learn about this product.  After eating it, [the taste and texture was not bad] I became sick in the way that I always do when ingesting gluten. Nana's also makes non-gluten products, and clearly are not careful about cross-contamination.  If you are concerned about ingesting gluten or keeping a strictly celiac diet, I strongly recommend you avoid this product.  I also think that the company should not deceive their customers, many who suffer from celiac disease, and should more clearly label their product as it is a danger to the health of many who would be inclined to buy this product."
negative,9/3/18,"The flavor is decent (berry vanilla), but I just can't handle the texture.  It's like a mouthful of sawdust that just disintegrates when you bite into it.  I've been gluten free for about 6 years, and there are much better products out there.  My kids won't even eat these!"
negative,18/5/18,"Like other reviewers, I rarely eat cookies because I have an anaphylactic response to wheat/gluten. Therefore I generally 'love' any cookies I'm not allergic to. These are an exception. The taste is mild and fleeting. The texture is like sand and leaves a dry feeling in your mouth. The only purpose these cookies are good for is dieting, because they are simply inedible. Blah."
negative,27/1/19,"I love the other Nana's cookie bars and cookies, so I thought I'd give these a try even though they are ""No Gluten"" and made with rice flour instead of wheat flour. They look nice, but the texture is a bit strange (it's kind of like eating really fine sand) and they are too dry and crumble at the slightest touch. They don't taste bad, which is a plus, but I won't be buying these again."
negative,10/11/19,"These are so gross I can't believe I wasted my money on them. They gave me an immediate migraine from the overwhelming artificial-smelling fragrance. I am NOT that picky an eater and I generally love any GF cookie just b/c I am so grateful they exist. But OMG I immediately spit this out AND rinsed out my mouth! Even my snack-loving toddler didn't like these. Eating them, that is. She did have a great time massaging it into a fine powder which takes almost no effort at all. What a mess. And what a waste of money."
negative,8/11/19,"We have a gluten free household of 5.  No one in our family likes these.  My children (9, 7, &5) are begging me to throw the box away - I think they are afraid I'll sneak one in their lunchbox.  The cookie crumbles leaving a dry mess of rice flour and hardish chewy fruity bits in your mouth.  Have a glass of water nearby if you try these.  I hate to leave a bad review, but there are way better gluten free options out there.<br /><br />(I won't throw the box away.  I'll pass it on to another gluten free family I know and let them form their own opinion.)"
negative,25/10/21,"I was disappointed in the unpleasant flavor and dry texture of Nana's Chocolate Munch Cookie Bars. To me there was an odd artificial almost chemical like after taste in them that cocoa powder can't even cover up. I threw away the entire box after tasting the first bar."

The taste of these bars is very banana-y<br />but I doubt you'll be able to ignor the texture long enough to enjoy that. The texture is akin to eating a handful of dirt (I'm no dirt-eating pro...but when I was trying to chew that's all I kept thinking). Please...if you're thinking about trying these...go down to your local natural foods market and pick up a box there first...while you're at it you may want to get some of your favorite soymilk...and lots of it!<br /><br />PS<br />If you're in the market for a yummy vegan bar...try the Betty Lous brand...The strawberry is super good!"

negative,26/3/20,"After eating this product, I had a stomach ache followed by hours on the toilet. Those of you with a gluten intolerance and Celiac disease know exactly what those symptoms mean... somehow this product is contaminated with gluten! It is NOT gluten free! Please spare yourself the pain and suffering. These cookies are not worth it.<br /><br />For those of you who are tempted to continue eating this product even after you have been informed that it is not gluten free, please keep these facts in mind:<br />1. If you eat gluten, it damages your intestinal lining.<br />2. If you keep on eating gluten the damage to your intestines will get worse and so will your symptoms.<br />3. If you further continue to eat gluten you will end up in malabsorption, increase your risk for intestinal cancer, and lead to all sorts of problems including infertility, autoimmune disorders, oteoporosis.<br />In other words, cheating on your diet is not worth it!<br />Don't eat Nana's products!<br /><br />Instead, I suggest you buy something like Pamela's chunky chocolate cookies. They are one of my favorites."
negative,24/2/20,I was a bit disappointed in these.  They crumble very easily and have an unusual texture.  My son (6) does not like them.

negative,13/1/20,"My kids love these fruit roll ups and I remember having them as a child so I was delighted when I saw I could buy a large box. However, when they came we were disappointed!  The were were very old and hard...  We only opened one and it broke into pieces. Because it's a food item, you can't return which I think is ridiculous...we couldn't even eat them! I order lots of stuff from Amazon and have had a great experience except for these fruit roll ups. Don't buy food from Amazon! (The only reason I gave it 1 star is because I had to click on something and they did arrive on time)."
negative,21/9/20,"We have two dogs and after a few weeks of switching to the Beneful Healthy Weight we've noticed very unpleasant results. They whine to go outside much more than they ever have and actually had bowel movements right in front of us if we don't get them outside in time.  Our dogs have gone from needing to go outside a few times a day to 6 or 7 times daily to handle the number of bowel movements they have. My theory is this dog food just goes right through the dog and not much of it actually is being utilized by the body. Which makes me wonder how many nutrients my dogs are actually receiving.  Poor dog food in my opinion and should only be used if your dog needs a laxative. I will most likely be going back to Purina One."
negative,2/12/20,"Ive noticed that my dog has had more frequent bowel movement than usual. He is on a strict schedule for potty break and has been very good on it for the past 4 years until i tried this food. Now he poops in my apt in front of us because he has to go so bad, like the poster above, its one hell of a laxative when my very well trained yorkie cant even hold it in"
negative,20/11/19,"I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like ""Beneful"" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: ""When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs."" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness."
negative,2/12/20,"I started giving my dog this a couple of weeks ago. He really loved a different Beneful and so I gave this one a try. He LOVES it and is excited when its time to eat. (He would barely touch Purina Little Bites) I took him out of state to my mom's place and he pooped in the house 3 times! I took the blame for not paying enough attention to him. However, since we've come back home he's pooped in my apt 3 times! (in 1 week) He NEVER does that. I thought that maybe he was being spiteful, but I really think he just can't help it. The food is one hell of a laxative if thats what you're looking for. I'm glad I only bought the small bag because I WILL NOT be giving this one another try. It only gets 2 stars because he likes it and because I'm sure he would lose weight if he keeps pooping this much. TERRIBLE."
negative,11/12/19,Disappointed.  The big boxes had a very different flavor than the smaller boxes.  I am not sure why but not good.
negative,20/11/19,"This is a really easy way to make terrible iced tea.  Sometimes convenience outweighs taste, but not always.  What this product doesn't tell you before you buy it is that the ingredients are: black tea with tea extract, hibiscus and citric acid.  It's not just tea.  And it doesn't taste like just tea, either.  It tastes like powdered iced tea from a jar.  It has an overtaste of lemon -- that's probably the citric acid.  And that fake tea flavor that comes from powdered iced tea mix.  I'll probably drink it when it's really convenient.  But I won't serve it to friends!  And I won't drink it if I have time to make a glass of real tea and pour it over ice."

negative,2/12/20,"I had high hopes for this product, because it is healthy and affordable.  But neither of my 2 Chihuahuas liked it; one just sniffed at it and walked away; the other dog chewed on it for a short while and then walked away from it.  One dog likes <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KUO2XS"">Nylabone Nutri Dent Original Minichews for Mini Dogs, 72-Count Pouch</a>, and the other dog likes <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004B3W4N8"">6"" BULLY STICKS - Free Range Standard Regular Thick Select 6 inch (10 Pack), by Downtown Pet Supply</a>.  I was looking for some alternatives that were healthy and more affordable.  I guess I'll be sticking with their current treats for now."
negative,20/11/19,"Although some may like this drink, it will not be a repeat buy for me.  140 calories for an 8+ oz serving is too much when that amount of orange juice is 115.  Actually this drink isn't 100% orange/tangerine juice, but a mix of juices.  Secondly, if this were unaltered juice, seems you wouldn't have to add ascorbic acid to get 100% of your daily Vitamin C since that amount of orange juice naturally provides over 150%. Perhaps the processing requires it. But, alas, the biggest issue for me was taste.  It tasted to me like dishwashing liquid smells.<br /><br />On the good side, the carbonization is just right and the flavor is bold for those who seek that.  There is no sugar added and the non-traditional taste is not overly sweet.  The taste may appeal to some, but I'm not a fan."
negative,1/3/21,"Yeah it's gluten free and whatever, but unless that's a really big issue for you and you're having trouble finding sugary drinks to enjoy on your gluten-free diet, there's no real draw to this drink over say, orange fanta or any number of other carbonated juice type drinks. I thought it was massively overly sweet, and I have something of a sweet tooth. The orange flavor wasn't particularly authentic or delicious, and it left a sour aftertaste. I got a free sample this time, and I cannot see actually paying money to buy this product again. On an environmental note, packaging and shipping these things in tiny little cans makes for more waste, and I don't appreciate that either. Not a fan."
negative,5/5/21,"Switch is a tangy drink that's more reminiscent of Sprite than Orange Juice. It's carbonated all the way and you will even burp after it as you would've after consuming any soft drink. The drink doesn't feel sugary, but a quick glance at the nutritional facts reveals that each can contains 34 grams of sugar. The claim on the can is that there are no additional sugars added, so I'm assuming that's the sugar from the orange and tangerine. The can"
negative,2/12/20,"I've become a fan of The Switch sodas. The black cherry flavor has a great balance of flavoring and carbonation that had me ready to give up traditional sodas. The Orange flavor; however, leaves a lot to be desired. It has a really strong after taste and despite being ""100% juice"" it tastes like bad artificial Orange flavoring.<br /><br />I'd opt for the grape or the black cherry for sure. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E"">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br /><br />Also, you'll want to note that The Switch sodas aren't exactly healthy, they are simply not overrun with artificial flavors. They actually have a fairly high calorie count. That being said they have some health benefits over pop- like the vitamin count and no added sugars."
negative,20/11/19,"I could not finish this drink, it is like drinking orange syrup. It may not have any added sugar in it but one can of 8.3 ounces has 34 sugar grams and 36 carbs. I'll stick to water when I want to quench my thirst!"
negative,9/10/21,"This product advertises that it is a soda made from 100% fruit juices and is refreshing.  I was quite disapointed in the flavor. If you have ever been unfortunate enough to drink canned (not refrigerated or fresh squeezed) OJ you know there is a HUGE differance in flavor. The bad, almost rotting component is carried over into this soda. IT even carries a rather odd aftertaste. I was not able to finish the entire can.<br /><br />This may be a feature of the Orange flavor. Other fruit flavors of this product might indeed taste good. But I recommend skilling the orange version."
negative,6/3/21,"I did not find this drink anything special in terms of taste; it is orange juice infused with carbonation. The juice is quite acidic and you don't feel that there is 100% fruit juice. The drink comes in cans rather than glass bottle which would have helped the drink maintain the juicy taste longer. It does not have any preservatives and it is gluten free, no sugar and no artificial flavors. This drink doesn't have any special features and it doesn't stand out well in a market crowded with many drinks.<br /><br />1. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXQK"">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Pomegranate, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />2. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q3ECXM"">Minute Maid Mixed Berry Juice, 24 - 10 fl oz Bottles, 240 fl oz</a><br />3.

negative,12/2/21,"I have a tendency to avoid products with artificial sweeteners, and this includes sodas with high fructose corn syrup.  The Switch is a line of fruit juice sodas with no added sweeteners--not even cane sugar.  It has carbonated water, fruit juice, some natural flavors and colors, and vitamin C.  If you're going to drink soda, carbonated fruit juice is the best way to go.<br /><br />The Switch has several flavors, including Orange Tangerine.  However, it's clear some flavors are better than others.  The Orange Tangerine has a harsh aftertaste that another flavor I tried does not.  I've tried other citrus juice sodas and enjoyed them, but something went wrong in the flavoring of this particular soda.  If you're looking for an orangey soda, try Izze's Sparking Clementine instead."
negative,2/12/20,"Described as an alternative to soda, Switch is a carbonated fruit drink made from 100% natural juices (although not necessarily the ones listed as the flavor).  Made mostly out of apple and grape juice, The Switch Orange Tangerine does in fact have an (oversweet)orange-tangerine flavor -- followed by a strong vitamin aftertaste. It tasted like drinking a soda made from crushed Flintstone vitamins.<br /><br />Want a better carbonated fruit drink?  Pour half a glass of orange juice and add club soda."
negative,20/11/19,"I like the idea of a healthy soda type drink, but this flavor just missed the mark. The tangerine overpowered the orange and left a bad taste in my mouth. Carbonated juice is a great idea, they just need to tweak the flavors a bit.<br /><br />Ranking the Switch drinks from best to worst:<br /><br />1. Watermelon Strawberry<br />2. Kiwi Berry<br />3. Black Cherry<br />4. Orange Tangerine"
negative,25/6/21,"The can says it's 100% juice, but the taste is ...powdery.  If you've ever had a glass of Kool-Aid or Crystal Light, you'll know what I mean.<br /><br />So there's that 'from powder' taste; also there is an aftertaste.  And all comes in a can the size of a Red Bull for 160 calories.<br /><br />I did not like it."
negative,17/3/20,"I'm a fan of all-natural anything, especially when it's a tasty and healthy alternative to something I've enjoyed my whole life, but I know is 'bad' for me.<br /><br />Regular soda is one of those 'bad' things.  Loaded with artificial colors, sweeteners, corn syrup...yuck.  Hardly seems worth the risk when I'm also getting 150 empty calories on average.<br /><br />And now Switch has come along.  True to its claim, there's nothing artificial in it.  Just juice, sparkling water and other 'all natural' ingredients.<br /><br />That's great.<br /><br />So I chose this particular flavor (orange tangerine) because I wanted the strong citrus taste I love.  This drink, however, failed to meet their promise.  Yes, I can 'taste' the orangy citrus, but as much I can taste the apple and grape juices used as well.<br /><br />Moreover, this doesn't have that bold 'pop' to it as other carbonated beverages have.  I've had mineral water with more bite.<br /><br />But the worse part about this 'good for me' drink is in clocks in at 140 calories (the same as a regular can of Coke) and 36gcarb/34g sugar (compared with Coke at 39/39).<br /><br />On the up side, it has less than half the sodium as many regular colas and does deliver 100% Vit C and 20% Vit A. But if I wanted those kind of health benefits, I'd rather take them directly from the source: an orange.<br /><br />Overall, the all-natural health pros of Switch Orange Tangerine, simply don't justify the high calorie and carb count.  The Switch Beverage Co. may have done better to sell sparkling water with a twist of orange peel if they wanted to provide a truly healthy alternative to traditional sodas."
negative,20/10/21,"I have a big sweet tooth and thought I would really like this, but it was too sweet even for me. I even tried adding water, but that didn't help. I haven't tried any of the other flavors, so I can't comment on the brand in general, but I'll never try this flavor again."
negative,21/7/20,"If you think this is going to be a healthy product, you are sadly mistaken. It still contains 36g of sugar per can!  If you want to end up a fat diabetic, by all means, try it. Otherwise, try the ZERO CALORIE, ZERO SUGAR, ZERO CHEMICAL naturally fruit flavored seltzers like those by La Croix."
negative,22/2/21,"These are definitely not worth close to a dollar a piece.  If they were at my local grocery, I might give twenty to thirty cents per can for them.  I didn't really like the flavor that well, but if you did, they might even worth up to fifty cents per can.  Otherwise, pass these up."
negative,8/6/21,"This had a nice citrus flavor, but it was too sweet and actually flat. I did not get any kind of fizz or sparkle. For the amount of sugar and calories, I rather would have eaten a piece of fruit and drank a glass of seltzer water - less calories and more satisfying in my mouth. I got this on GB special for about $13.52 for the case. I don't think I will purchase again."
negative,2/12/20,"I've tried other flavors of Switch carbonated juice drinks and have enjoyed them. However, this particular flavor of orange tangerine was way too sweet. I felt like I was drinking some sort of carbonated orange ade drink and could barely get it down. While I would probably purchase the other flavors of Switch, I definitely would not purchase this one."
negative,20/11/19,"I was anxious to try this, but upon the first sip it was apparent to me that this drink was not going to go well for me.  It has a very sharp/harsh citrus-y metallic flavor and combined with the overwhelming sweetness, the two seem to battle it out in my mouth for dominance.  After awhile it seemed like the drink was going down more like syrup more than a carbonated beverage.<br /><br />The can is small at 8.3 oz (a regular sized pop can is 12 oz) and the cost of these little guys seem a little bit astronomical.<br /><br />I also am a bit dubious of its attempts to seem like a healthy alternative to pop.  It still has loads of sugar in it.  So when they claim ""no additional sugar"" this may lead you to believe no sugar or low sugar... but it does in fact have 34 grams."
negative,25/1/21,"To me, fruit juice in small cans are simply a staple - first example that comes to mind is good ol' Dole pineapple juice. The trend towards trendy little ""health"" beverages in overpriced little cans is nearly tragic.<br /><br />There is nothing about this product that would compel me to buy it. If I want a soda, I'll just grab one. I don't drink enough of them to have much dietary impact and despite the claim of ""100% What You Want"", there is nothing in here for me. If I want 100% Of What I Want, I will buy a few oranges and some seltzer water. If I want ""0% Of What You Don't Want"", well, why buy it?<br /><br />This is a time when we had better look pretty closely at what is an indulgent convenience and what is a necessity, and how to find a happy medium. I consider the likes of Pellegrino Aranciata, Orangina and Izze a luxury, and when I indulge it is a true delight.<br /><br />""Switch"" is a product that is not better tasting, proven healthier, or even less expensive than any of many other alternatives. Once again marketing is driving product creation and design, and that is a hateful concept.<br /><br />If you want a similar taste experience for about the same price,  pick up some Alka-Seltzer Cold Plus Nighttime- you'll stop sneezing and sniffling and get a great night's sleep."
negative,1/7/21,"Pros: not overly sweet like some juice drinks<br />  no caffeine<br />  no corn sweeteners (if that matters to you)<br />Cons:  expensive for the size (8.3 ounces)<br />  can't taste the orange or tangerine juices in it<br />  lots of calories<br /><br />I grew up eating oranges and tangerines off my grandparents' trees.  I was surprised that I couldn't taste those flavors in this drink, but then I looked at the ingredient list on the can and those were the juices that were used in the smallest amounts - probably to keep the cost down.<br /><br />I'll stick to the Sobe low-cal drinks and the 10 calorie Vitamin Water because 1 - they are cheaper and  2 - I'd rather save up my daily allotment of calories for something with more flavor."
negative,30/9/20,"I grew up on orange sodas and thought this might be like a 'healthy' Crush. That would be a NO. Of course, tangerine has a bit of a different taste than orange as it's that much sweeter. Adding the carbonation to it just made it an unappealing fizzy, ultra sweet drink, not unlike cough syrup. Proceed with caution. Perhaps kids would find it super tasty."
negative,15/3/20,"I didn't like this drink at all! It had a very strange, almost chemically taste to it. I also didn't appreciate Switch marketing itself as ""all-natural"" but had ingredients like ""natural flavors and colors"". What are they?? Are they even natural?? I even let my three year old try it but she couldn't even swallow it and spit it out in the sink. Too bad. It would have been a good alternative to sodas but not with this horrible taste. My daughter and I much prefer the OOba Hibiscus drink."
negative,6/7/21,"I wrote a 5 star review of the Kiwi Berry flavor.  That isn't usually my favorite flavor of anything, but it was surprisingly good.<br /><br />Orange Tangerine (which would generally be among my first picks of fruit-flavored beverages is flat by comparison -- literally.<br /><br />It seemed to lack the right amount of carbonation.  It also tastes weaker and too sweet.<br /><br />Try the Kiwi Berry instead."
negative,29/6/21,"I thought it would have a clean, crisp taste, but it honestly tasted just like every other orange soda I've ever had.  Maybe that's deliberate; maybe they're targeting people who would otherwise drink orange soda, unless presented with a more ""natural"" alternative...  Regardless, it tastes exactly like carbonated reconstituted juice concentrates, with some orange coloring thrown into the mix, i.e., nothing special."
negative,29/6/21,"The carbonation in this drink was way too much. So much in fact, that it over powered the flavor. (Orange-tangerine is usually very good together).  I expect this from a soda, but not a ""healthy"" drink. Lose some of that club soda bite and you have one delicious drink. Until then, I'll pass."
negative,26/7/21,"This drink is very, very sweet, and only mildly carbonated.<br /><br />I don't drink soda, but i do occasionally like bubbles in my drinks. I had some hope that Switch would be a nice bubbly fruit drink to fill this need, but it's not. The ingredients may be all-natural, but it's still syrupy, and has an odd aftertaste that i think is from the added vitamin C.<br /><br />For regular soda drinkers, the sweetness may not be as offensive, but for anyone expecting something that tastes like sparkling fruit juice, this will be a disappointment. I'd still choose this over an orange soda, but i'd choose to have nothing at all rather than this.<br /><br />Also, note that the cans are only 8.3 ounces each, smaller than normal 12oz soda cans."
negative,21/10/21,"While orange juice is the fourth ingredient in this drink,  the dominant flavor is a muddy orange which is backed up by a low level of carbonation.  I think that the use of the inexpensive apple and white grape juices as the first two ingredients (tangerine is third) is what results in the unpleasant muddied orange taste. Finally they threw in a bit of acerola juice but to no avail.  To my taste this stuff is suprisingly unpalatable.<br /><br />While the marketing suggestion is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely ""natural"" sugar in this or most any juice.  The healthy alterative to overly sugared fruit juices is to have a glass of cold water and a piece of fresh fruit.  Fruit has less calories than juice but overall more vitamins, minerals and fiber and a variety of natural antioxidants that most likely really are good for you."
negative,25/10/21,"well, my husband, myself and my 12 year old son sampled this drink. My husband hated it. I felt like it was OK, but nothing to write home about. The taste to me was too orangey and for a ""natural"" product it sure didn't taste like one. My 12 year old liked it. He also likes gummy worms and sour straws, so you can take his review for what it is.<br /><br />I personally wouldn't buy this product.<br />2 stars"
negative,29/6/21,"Ouch, this stuff is sweet, as in REALLY sweet...  This is really harsh tasting and we were disappointed.  Most soda doesn't have this much sugar, the 8.3 oz can has 29 grams of sugar, yikes!  For a 12 oz can of soda, that would be like having 45 grams of sugar, who would drink that?<br /><br />They need to water this WAY down, we're going to end up giving the rest of this away, we can't drink it."
negative,5/7/21,"When I saw the Switch Orange Tangerine was available, I knew I had to try it.  I liked the Kiwi Strawberry quite well (better than some other reviewers did, it seems), so I was sure I would enjoy this one just as much.<br /><br />The initial taste of this Orange Tangerine carbonated juice is rather tart, and the carbonation just seems to make it more tart.  The aftertaste is rather pleasant, so if the aftertaste is what you're looking for in a drink, this is the drink for you.  My wife thought it tasted a bit like champagne, if that's any indication of what to expect from this drink.<br /><br />The flavor is different, and not at all what I expected.  Not very refreshing at all.  I would buy the Kiwi Berry drink, but I think I'll take a pass on the Orange Tangerine in the future."
negative,17/9/21,"This was the most potent orange drink I have ever had. It might be ""100% juice,"" but this drink has some kick.<br /><br />There are no artificial sweeteners in this drink, but it is so highly concentrated that it was overwhelmingly sweet and even the tang of the carbonation couldn't cute into the sugary flavor.<br /><br />It was WAY too strong for me and I thought it had kind of an odd aftertaste, but if you like carbonation and have a powerful craving for orange-tangerine, this is the drink for you."
negative,18/8/21,"These seemed like a great idea. I would be able to load up 50 k-cups with any type of coffee I chose, and still maintain the speed of using the store bought cups in my rush to get ready every morning. After waiting a month for this product to reach me (20 days before they even shipped it!) I finally found it on my doorstep.<br /><br />Upon opening the box my hopes lifted even higher; these are solid little cups of a much higher quality than I expected. I filled one and snapped the lid down. I ensured it was sealed all the way around, placed it in my Kuerig, and hit the brew button. At first it seemed to be working splendidly then coffee began pouring out of places it isn't supposed to. By the time it was over I had quite a mess to clean up. Upon opening the Kuerig I found the DisposaKup completely in tact and the lid still secured properly. However the bit of overhanging filter was soaked, dripping, and HOT! I had discovered the source of the leak. I have tried again several times with the same reoccurring problem. I guess I should have bought the EcoBrew cup after all.<br /><br />If you like the appearance of convenience, and the reality of spending more time cleaning up a mess this is the product for you.<br /><br />(I went ahead and gave it two stars because I like the idea of the product so much.)"
negative,31/7/21,"Caused my cuisinart k-cup brewer to leak every time I used it.  Great idea, just needs some adjustments so that the coffee maker works properly with it."
negative,18/10/21,THE LIDS DO NOT FIT. COFFEE RUNS OUT OF THE POD. A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. THERE ARE OTHER FILTERS ON THE MARKET THAT ARE MUCH BETTER.
negative,29/6/21,"I will start by being kind, It is a good idea to save money with an item or concept like this. It makes good sense to use your own coffee beans and avoid the cost of the pre-filled commercial K-cups you buy at the store.<br /><br />Now, I received my DisposaKups over a month after ordering them and put them to use.  I was immediately disappointed, filters did not hold very much coffee, It was a struggle to get the lids to fit together with the filter and outer plastic cup.  The coffee was very weak.<br /><br />This product actually creates more waste in a landfill than the commercially made K-cups. The body and lids are plastic.  Normal K-cups do not have a plastic lid.  Notice they say 100% disposable....So put them in the trash. They are not recyclable = landfill.<br /><br />They are not convenient, they are a bit messy, a pain to put together and still expensive.  Not worth it! There are better alternatives out there that will save you money, make better coffee and not go into a landfill.<br /><br />Sorry, I wish I had better news, I think I will return these."
negative,16/9/21,"For product to work properly (IMHO) you need coffee ground as fine as possible. Once filter has been inserted, plave carefully leveled measure of coffee in it. Manuever lid into place, then press down on center-STEADILY- w/ thumb.<br /><br />Plan to use no more than 6 Oz. of water for your cup.<br /><br />Removal of used cup from machine is occasional problem. (Jiggle it and it will generally loosen up.)"
negative,24/8/21,"The products lid stays attached to the needle on the Keurig, allowing coffee grounds to fall everywhere. Very messy. If this didn't happen, it would work well."
negative,24/6/21,"These cups were difficult to cap (putting the lids on securely was a comedy show) and they created a mess when used in the Keurig; the water went everywhere.  Add together PIA and MESS with an end outcome of weak cup o' Joe = I'm not a very happy buyer."
negative,27/9/21,The lids are impossible to secure.  This purchase was a complete waste of money.  Product cannot be used as lids are unable to be secured.
negative,29/6/21,"I ordered the disposa kups with the thought of making my own kups. They don't fit together without a big production. The lids won't fit and water comes out the top of the brewer lid as well as the kcup. Just a big mess. not what I wanted at all. want to return them and get a refund. Donna Phillips"
negative,5/8/21,"First of all, I thought I could save money filling my own Keurig K-Cups. By the time I bought the fillable cups, paid shipping and bought coffee to put in them, I was already in the hole.<br />If all you have to do is fill these little cups all day I guess it will work for you, because you can have the coffee of your choice. The other problem was is they get stuck in the brewer when you try to take them out.<br />I still have about thirty left, and when they are gone I will not replace them."
negative,29/6/21,"I thought these would be the perfect answer. Sadly, I guess the pressure with which my Keurig machine shoots the water through the k-cup is too much for the disposa cup, because every single time I tried it, coffee grounds were spewed up through the tiny hole in the lid of the disposa cup all over the inside of where the k-cup sits in my keurig. And yes, I used them properly.<br /><br />So the issue, at least in my Keurig machine, seems to be with the lids. Some have suggested its a design flaw with the Keurig machine. In either case, these disposa cups were NOT the answer for me.<br /><br />Biggest waste of money ever. I cannot recommend."
negative,31/7/21,"The service and delivery from Amazon was great.  However, the product itself is not worth buying.  No matter what I try, coffee leaks out around the Kcup when brewing....it makes a mess!  Wanted the cups to use my favorite coffee (Tim Hortons), but guess I'll just have to get used to other brands!"
negative,11/9/21,"The lids keep popping off when the cup fills up with water, the only I have not tried is putting 2 holes in bottom of the cup so that the water might flow out faster. It's a damn mess getting coffee grounds in your cup! I would not buy anymore of them, unless I can fix the problem!!!!!No more disposebale K-cups for me!"
negative,12/8/21,"I was anxious to try these cups since they seemed to be sealed like the original K-Cups, but was very disappointed in the product.  Though the cups came with no instructions, it was apparent that you just put the filter in, add coffee, then pop the lid on.  Trouble is, the filters size and shape indicate they should hang over the outside edge of the cup, but when doing that I found it impossible to seal the cups.  So I had to tuck the filter inside to be able to close and seal the lid.  After doing that and trying, the coffee ran VERY slow though the K-Cup and after only about three cups, the Keurig machine seemed to get clogged up and stop working.  I cleaned out with vinegar and tried again, but same result.  I ended up throwing these away as it didn't seem worth the effort to return them.  NOT a good product!"
negative,31/7/20,These K-Cups have damaged something causing the water to not come through my already made K-Cups. I now have to put a ready made in and puncture it then open it and turn the K-Cup and puncture it again for the water to come through. I think the material in the disposable K-Cup is too heavy and damages the needle on the bottom.
negative,13/6/20,"The basic problem with this product is that unless you load a VERY small amount of coffee in the filter, the filter clogs.  This causes the coffee ground and hot water to back up through the hole in the top and cause a mess.  My son and I spent a few hours experimenting with different ways to prevent this but we have admitted defeat.  I suspected the filter but I used filters which work perfectly fine in my EZ Cup still result in a mess on my kitchen counter. Even worse, coffee grounds in my coffee!  However, if you like your coffee very weak, this will work well for you.  I hope they can fix the design issues.  Until then, I will stick with my EZ Cup."
negative,31/7/20,"Thought this might be a nice alternative to use with my favorite coffee, but was sadly disappointed.  It leaked all over - no matter what we tried and the coffee was weak, machine clogged with most attempts and water wouldn't brew thru.  At times the cup even melted a little - leaving a nasty taste in the coffee.<br /><br />Go with the greener alternative and try the ekobrew - much better results and no waste."
negative,13/6/20,"I purchased this item as an alternative to traditional K-cups in an attempt to save money; however, this product did not work well in my machine. I followed the directions and read reviews to see what works best, but was not able to use the K-cups effectively. The cup itself is too weak and warps in my machine. I compared the shape before and after and there is a big difference; this K-cup seems to expand horizontally and vertically because the plastic is not strong enough. Also, the K-cup is shaped differently from the traditional K-cup. This is neccessary because it does not use foil as a topper, but does not seem to work. In the end, I had to clean up several coffee explosions in my kitchen to figure out how it works, but still could not use it effectively. Maybe I am not doing something correctly, but I'm sure there is also an issue with the product itself. While I do like the idea, I would not suggest purchasing this product until the bugs are worked out."
negative,26/9/20,"Well, at least they live up to their name. These nuts are definitely hot, too bad that's all the positive I have to say about them. Other than that, they taste like cardboard, and not very good cardboard either."
negative,17/10/20,"MADE IN CHINA..<br />Even our dog food has gone the way of the Hershey Kiss. I won't be back to this vendor.<br />Will be looking for made and sold in AMERICA only....."
negative,14/12/20,"I eat mixed nuts all the time at work. They make a healthy snack instead of the donuts, etc. that are always around. The plus side of these is that they are much lower salt than usual. The down side is that they are almost all cashews. Very few brazil nuts, pecans and it is a miracle to find a macadamia nut. The lack of variety is disappointing."
negative,29/5/20,The price was comparable to Walmart for same size product.  However these nuts were not as crunchy; and they needed a little more salt.
negative,9/12/20,"I would recommend not buying these nuts if you are looking for some really good tasting nuts.  These are just average quality, and the brazil nuts taste just plain awful.  The only good tasting nut in this lot is the almond and pecans.  There are barely any pecans, but tons of cashews.  Try another brand as I am sure there is something better out there."
negative,4/8/20,These are a cheap fake. Nothing like the real Emerald nuts you buy in the store. Its a complete waste of money. DONT get ripped off like I did.
negative,31/7/20,"Good quality product, but you would have to REAlly love curry flavor to like these... They are so awful I don't know what to do with them, but I know I won't be eating them.... I'll stick to the plain sea salt ones:)"
negative,13/6/20,"Unfortunately I am completely disappointed with this product. I have an above-average sense of smell, but this extract has hardly any detectable flavor in the bottle and none whatsoever once added to food. Perhaps I received part of a faulty batch? The seller is letting me return the bottle, but is requiring that I pay for shipping again, so I would be very unlikely to order from them again."
negative,21/11/20,"Lacks the flavor I was hoping for and the price was a bit high for the satisfaction level.  I won't be ordering this again.  Live and learn."
negative,25/5/21,"All of the positive reviews led me to believe this popcorn was going to be really great. Truth is, I am disappointed. The popcorn kernels are tough, chewy and lack any great corn taste. I want popcorn that snaps when you bite into it.  I will go back to buying the premium Orville Redenbacher's brand at my local grocery."
negative,25/5/21,"So far I'm not impressed with this popcorn. It's tender when popped, but it's really annoying how much doesn't pop. I'm going to add a little water and then let it sit, closed up, for a while and see if that helps. As of right now, I wouldn't buy this popcorn again."
negative,20/1/21,"These are supposed to be cherry and brandy filled chocolates. If they contain brandy, it is too subtle for me to detect. A clue to the cause may be the stickiness of the package and the cracks in the candies. It appears they were mistreated at some point and may have leaked. But the box they came in shows no damage. A friend speculated that airline decompression burst them. Maybe, but other imported chocolates don't suffer this problem.<br /><br />I should also mention that the chocolate tastes a little bit dusty on the outside.<br /><br />I can't really recommend these Laroshell candies. There are other brands which are quite good."
negative,15/1/21,"I do like the idea of these crackers for gluten free eating, but I can't bring myself to enjoy them. I bought the 6-pack variety and have tried the Maple Cinnamon and the Onion Garlic. I generally like flax, but these just aren't setting well with me even when I use them as a carrier for dips. I feel I wasted my money. I'll probably give the unopened packs to a friend's family that are gluten free."

negative,10/2/21,"I bought this item thinking it might be equivilent to Starbucks or Davinci Hazelnut syrup but it's not. At first it tastes like Hazelnut then you get the flavor of cheap pancake syrup followed by an aftertaste that can best be described as tasting stale. The price is only slightly better than what I can get the Davinci Brand at Sam's club but the quality is far lower in my opinion. For hazelnut fans I suggest avoiding this particular brand."
negative,9/10/20,"I'm sorry I bought this brand. It leaves a lousy after taste in your mouth.No wonder Amazon is giving .99cent shipping on this item. STAY AWAY!!! AVOID!!!!"
negative,31/7/20,"The flavor of Big Train Hazelnut is not significant. One has to add a lot to have a flavor impact. Of the three Big Train flavors I purchased (including Vanilla and Irish Creme), Hazelnut is the least satisfactory. (Vanilla's a little better; Irish Creme is best--I gave that one 4 stars)."

negative,1/11/20,"I ordered the 6 month ice cream of the month club for my wife's birthday.  She received her first shipment today and none of the 4 ice creams that were sent matched the sheet they included explaining the ice creams (you could have bought several of the ice creams, such as butter pecan or mint chocolate chip, in your local grocery store).  When I called the 800 number I was told that occasionally they reserve the right to change the ice cream if it doesn't ""meet their quality"" guidelines.  When I told her none of the four ice creams that we received matched the overview sheet from amazingclubs, the customer service rep was rude and told me that I needed to call back and talk to someone in their ""support group"" (note: you must call before 6:00 PM EST to speak to someone in this group). I would seriously caution you to shell out more than $300 for this club."

It says so right on the label.<br /><br />I was very angry about this, but JR Mushrooms has said they will refund me for the truffles and even let me keep them.  So I give JR credit for excellent  responsiveness and customer service, although I still feel they should not be labeled ""black winter truffles""."
negative,21/7/20,I though this product lack flavor as I taste different brands far better.<br />There were no real flavor as I expected. Sorry
negative,5/1/21,"We tried these and they were bland and had no redeeming qualities. We sauteed them slightly and also tried them as is shaved. The price as some have mentioned reflects what you get for truffles.  Spend your money on white truffle oil you'll be much happier, we are.  Also wait for the white truffles to come in from Italy, I would not knock JR as a company but would not recommend this offering."
negative,23/1/21,"i ordered this in the past and was extremely disappointed. they are unlike truffles that i know of. they were hard like a huge seed, had no truffle aroma. i threw all contents out. will never order them again"
negative,31/7/20,"I should have listened to the negative reviews, but hoped that the positive reviews would ring more true. There was veery little truffle flavor that got entirely lost in the risotto I made. I agree with the other reviewers in that this was woody and flavorless. Not worth even this price for truffles."
negative,13/6/20,"Little lesson on TRUFFLES...<br />Truffles graded ""Extra"" are larger than most, the second highest in truffle quality. Best when used at the conclusion of the cooking process, to release all their aroma and perfume. Chefs suggest to slice or shave thinly over pastas, risottos and omelets. Whole -entire truffles- are marked ""brushed"" (which means they have been cleaned of any soil or dirt), preserved in brine or truffle juice -which can be discarded or use to flavor sauced or broths -and are ready to use.<br /><br />Preserved truffles are a nice, budget-friendly way to add VISUAL truffle appeal to dishes. However, if you are looking to add the pungent aroma and taste of truffles to your dish, chefs recommend that you explore fresh truffle selections. Jarred or canned truffles, sold by vendors, are mere shadows of their fresh truffle selves and will not, by themselves, deliver the aroma or flavor of fresh truffles. They are great to use with truffle oil - the oil will add the flavor, the preserved truffles the truffle ""look"", but preserved truffles should be used only to garnish a dish, or in conjunction to truffle butter and oil during those times when fresh truffles are out of season or when the budget doesn't allow for the real thing.<br />NOTE: Preserved truffles out of the jar or can have almost NO FLAVOR or odor. If you are looking for the true flavor of a fresh truffle, then please go to seek fresh truffle pages online and purchase a fresh truffle. If you're looking to add a truffle LOOK only to your dish, then this is the product for you.<br /><br />Better to buy real truffle oil & experiment, for example ""JR Mushrooms & Specialties"" on Amazon, is a good start--about 10 dollars is low commitment that is in line with a superior bottle of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)."
negative,1/12/20,"Zero stars for this item.  I couldn't even confirm that the wrinkled little animal-offal sort of thing is a truffle.  This lacks any aromatic attraction at all.  I'd be afraid to put it in anything I planned to eat for fear it would ruin the entire item.<br /><br />As for the famous JR service, my complaints about this product have been ignored."
negative,30/1/21,"I am the biggest fan of mushrooms you'll ever meet, but these are really disgusting. They taste like dirt. I have to imagine better quality truffles (if these are even truffles at all) are muuuuch better. They'd have to be. There'd be no comparison. These are really bad."
negative,1/1/21,"These truffles are not as great as they are made up to be. I thought for the price they would have a greater taste, but they didn't have much taste at all. They are not worth the price, but had to find out for myself. I will not be buying truffles again, and I'm not going to spend over $10 for a fresh one."
negative,11/1/21,"This is the worst flavored coffee I have ever tried.  There is no aroma or flavor of Chocolate/Raspberry to this coffee bean at all.  In fact the coffee tastes sour.

It is wildly UN-delicious and UN-healthy for you!<br />(Yeah, I'm embarrassed that I didn't read the label first!)"
negative,13/6/20,"The product was okay but the color was very different than advertised.  It was a darker pink, not red at all.<br /><br />I tried to use it a couple different ways, and as a relative beginner, I did not find the product easy to use.<br /><br />I tried mixing in with a little vanilla extract in order to ""paint"" it on (I had read this was the best way to do it).  I found that the painting was very streaked and not very consistent.  Maybe someone more experienced will be able to use it more effectively.  In the end, because the red color was important for the cake, I mixed it with red food coloring instead of vanilla extract.  the pearl dust used this way had just a little impact on the color, not a great deal.<br /><br />In the end, I would have experimented more on the best way to use it if the color had been more red.  But as was, I didn't find it super useful and will be unlikely to purchase again.  I hope that other people have a better experience as I very much like the idea of the product."

negative,23/11/20,This is twice as expensive as basic box Mac and Cheese.  It is just so so in taste.  If you check the ingredients it is not much different than other Mac and Cheese.

negative,29/8/20,"I have been disappointed with this product.  We have always enjoyed Annie's products & have never had a problem, until now.  The ""cheese"" was so solidly clumped that I was unable to make a sauce without lumps.  I have used 3 different packages from my order & have had the problem with all of them.

The single mixes worked well as they included yeast packaged separately in the mix.  My machine states clearly not to get the yeast wet, to put it on top of the flour away from the water.  The mixes in this collection have the yeast in the flour, not packaged separately.  The bread failed to rise at all.  Why would they package the yeast separately in the single mixes and not in the multi packs?  Along with the Heartland Collection I also purchased the Baker's Choice Collection.  I am throwing them all out.  Don't waste your money."
negative,18/6/21,"The bread has a good taste but does not rise properly and only makes 1/2 loaf.  I checked the temp of the water as suggested with bad results.  After raising the temp to 100 degrees I got it to rise to 3/4 loaf.  Pretty expensive for the quality and I won't buy again."

Also, my older dog tends to get really ""diggy"" when she is eating something not good for her and with this food she was constantly digging at the couch!  I have no idea what is wrong with this food, none of the ingredients stand out to me as being the cause but something in it really messed my puggies up!"
negative,18/6/21,"The problem with this peanut butter is the use of ""evaporated cane juice"" which is a coy way of saying ""raw sugar"". Accent--on the SUGAR. The sugar is gritty and overpowers the peanut taste and the maple. It wasn't very maple-y. It was gritty, sweet and pretty much not great. Maybe the ""cane juice"" crystallized to the low moisture content of peanut butter. Anyway, it was a loser.<br /><br />I had heard much hype about this peanut butter, started by someone who has a peanut butter sandwich restaurant in New York. I happen to like PBJ and celery with pb--a tablespoon of peanut butter is a fairly good snack even if you are watching your food intake but this peanut butter is too sugary for my tastes. I gave it two stars--if you are making a confection or cookies, it could be very good, but as eat-alone peanut butter, I found it way too sweet and gritty for my tastes."

negative,7/7/21,"This soup is just offensive.  Why does it taste like cinnamon?  Also, it's twice the price of Campbell's and 1/4 the chicken.  Sure, it says it's organic.  I totally believe that, don't you?"
negative,15/7/21,"I found this exact same product, same size at our local grocery store (QFC and Safeway) for $2.99. So, am not sure why this product is priced so much higher."
negative,11/7/21,"The tree is nice, but that is the only part besides the pot.  Did NOT come with a matching drip tray, as promised.  Instructions were lacking information and were merely a printed piece of paper."
negative,7/10/21,"What's in this stuff?  Where's the list of ingredients?<br /><br />I don't eat anything unless I know and approve of what's in it.<br /><br />For example, although this product's description says it contains no sugar, it does not say if it contains any artificial sweeteners, which are also bad for you.<br /><br />For one thing, aside from tasting awful, artificial sweeteners often cause horrendous intestinal cramps and diarrhea.<br /><br />In addition to having long ago given up the eating of sugar and sugar in all its guises (e.g: ""natural"" cane juice, fruit juices, ""raw"" sugar, ""organic"" sugar, etc.), I also stopped ingesting artificial sweeteners of any kind.<br /><br />So, what's in this stuff?"
negative,6/7/21,"I have tried many different protein powders over the years, and while it is hard to write a review based on taste alone (since everyone's taste is different), I'm going to go ahead and say this is the most rancid tasting gunk I have ever had the displeasure of putting in my mouth.<br /><br />I mix my protein shakes with a hand blender, so I rarely have any mixing problems - and even this protein mixed well.  The fun really began when I tasted it.  It tastes sour and acrid at the same time, absolutely horrendous.  I could not finish the shake I had mixed up, and had to wash my mouth out with apple juice to get that sick taste out before I could actually eat or drink anything else.<br /><br />This is a terrible protein powder from the standpoint of taste, in my opinion.  Of all the types I have tried, which is many, this has taken seat as the new ""worst"" one.<br /><br />FYI, I had ordered this with another brand because I am testing egg protein powders due to casein sensitivity.  If anyone has an egg protein powder recommendation, PM me."
negative,18/6/21,"So after comparing this to Jay Robb, I can say that this protein is not as good. The taste isn't as good, and it doesn't mix that easy. I don't think it is horrible, just not that good.<br /><br />One thing I like about the Jay Robb is that they use hormone free chicken eggs. I sent Healty N' Fit an email asking where they get their eggs from, but they didn't reply. It is a little cheaper, but I found the Jay Robb at Vitamin Shoppe for 20 per 12ozs, which isn't bad. I have to say that I don't like the dudes picture on the bottle, but that's my only complaint."
negative,7/7/21,"The protein powder is ok, not to good as i expected. if you pour hot milk over it will will form substance like egg white, which is very bad in taste, not at all drinkable."
negative,27/7/21,"I used this product cod roe (tarako spaghetti sauce )to eat when i feel lazy at japan.<br />that very cheap and just boil pasta and mix this pouch because<br />i ate that product once a week in japan.<br /><br /> after i moved here america year ago i really miss some asian food because little expensive but<br />when i see picture i remind how good and excited because i bought this from amazon .<br /><br />BUT taste little different , I was disappointed, too strong smell like a ocean .<br />I throw garbage because i did not remember product of japan america.<br /><br /> i never ever buy this in america."
negative,13/7/21,"This sounded so tasty from the reviews and the flavors were enticing...so I ordered some.  We had some for breakfast today and then went to pack the other boxes in bags to go to the homeless shelter.  To us, it is dreadful.  It has the texture of paste and not even palatable...for us.  Am throwing out the box we opened and canceling my order on subscribe and save.  When you consider how easy it is to make real oatmeal, I'm sorry I was fooled by these flavors."
negative,13/9/21,"I used quotes around the word tea because I doubt that the bags contain tea.  I wouldn't be surprised if the bags contained ground up sticks instead of tea.  I would not give this product a single star; it deserves zero stars in my opinion.<br />This tool is not allowing me to continue without giving the product at least one star."
negative,7/9/21,"The grains make this food really flakey. It just doesn't stick together and was falling off the spoon. A major mess really. It also doesn't have a zip lock top and I thought it did like many of the other pouch foods and took this with us out to dinner. I ended up putting the leftovers in a plastic baggie. My baby also was not a fan of this at all and she is not a picky eater. Even my dogs turned their nose up at it and I thought it tasted pretty nasty."
negative,17/4/21,Sent this to my mother to help her out with groceries since she is on a fixed income. She said it was horrible and would be throwing the other 2 boxes out. So I would not reccomend this product.
negative,10/3/21,"I had pretty high hopes for the Busy Bone. I have a large, active chewer (the kind of dog that has to have several bones to choose from all the time if you don't want her to chew up your bed frame). I was hoping that with the Busy Bone's 'long-lasting' promise, I might be able to just give her one of these and at least have time to wash the dishes. Why don't I describe what happened next...<br />I was in the kitchen washing the dishes. It had been about fifteen minutes since I'd given the dog the bone. Deeply absorbed in annoyance with myself for not rinsing said dishes, I was scrubbing vigorously when an awful sound met my ears: a terrible and hauntingly familiar crunching noise. The dog was eating my bed. So I go into the bedroom to scold her and even before I get a chance to look at the bed frame, I am struck by the mess she has caused. The Busy Bone somehow leaves little brown crumbles ALL over the floor. Too small and numerous to pick up by hand and too gushy for the vacuum cleaner to clean up, the oobleck has to be washed out of the carpet with a dish rag. And did I mention that they're expensive?<br />I will continue to stick with real bones that I purchase from the butcher. They're cheaper, they last longer, and they don't leave a terrible mess."
negative,17/4/21,"My dog demolished her busy bone in under 5 minutes. I think she basically ate it, which was a huge disappointment. We were hoping for something that we could give her that she would ENJOY, but also something that would last a bit longer. In addition to being more of a treat than a chew, these things are messy. She had it all over the floor around her,and all over her paws. It makes a sticky...goop that isn't very easy to clean up. I definitely won't buy these again, it's too expensive to only last 5 minutes."
negative,21/1/21,"I write this letter after considerable thought and anguish.  On Friday morning, February 25, 2011, I was awakened by the screams of my fianc&eacute;e Lori as she sat on the living room floor cradling Greta, our 2 ¬Ω year-old registered female Pug.  Greta crawled under the coffee table and there choked to death alone on a Purina Busy Bone.<br /><br />I'm left wondering how Purina, a company with a name as iconic as Betty Crocker, Bayer, Gerber and General Mills, could have not only manufactured such a lethal product, but, as I've since discovered on the Internet, has had issues with it in the deaths of other dogs for some time - and not pulled this dangerous item from the shelves.  I find this absolutely appalling.  I'm 57 years-old and I've put my trust in Purina products since I was a child.  And now our beloved Greta, purchased from a breeder as an adorable puppy in the fall of 2008, is dead because of your product.  And Lori, my sweetheart of 32 years, a stroke victim in 2004 and who most certainly can do without this kind of stressful catastrophe; a great animal lover, has had her heart torn asunder.  She's simply devastated - and angry.  And so am I.<br /> Did you know that in the United States its citizens spend more on their pets than their children?  Are you familiar with the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show series which includes the world's finest breeds in competition for ""Best in Show,"" including the Chinese Pug?  Do you have any idea of the loss we've suffered at your negligent hands?<br /> I could talk about the money we paid for Greta from the breeder, and having her spayed (we don't breed our beloved pets; we keep them as loving companions for as long as we can).  And there are the regular check-ups, and shots and so on.  I find it bitterly ironic that the veterinary office we use is within walking distance of the Kroger store from which we purchased your killing Busy Bone.<br /> I have a 91 year-old father who lives alone.  I visit him at least twice a week, sometimes more if time allows.  He certainly appreciates those visits.  But he also has a fulltime companion - Spencer, his Jack Russell terrier.  Spencer will turn 12 in May.  Dad is disabled, uses a walker, is scheduled for heart-valve replacement surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, and has a myriad of other health issues.  Yet despite them he has managed to take very good care of his dog.  And I believe if it weren't for the loving attention Spencer gives dad, he would not be alive today.  His dog has given him something special - the gift of life.  Something which Purina has stolen away from us.  You'd think that Purina would have the same consideration for the welfare of dogs in this country as a disabled 91 year-old man.  But tragically that's not the case.<br /> Yet there's more.  We also have a male pug which we named Winston because he has the same tenacious bulldog features etched into his amazing face as that of Winston Churchill.  Winston, like Greta was, is truly an individual - a soulful companion.  And like us, he's now subdued.  He's actually depressed because his playmate has disappeared and he doesn't understand why.  This concerns me.<br /> I am a professional photographer and writer by trade.  I work with the general public and I have to present a side to it which instills confidence.  Writing, by nature, requires a certain state of mind as well.  As a result of losing Greta, all I can think about now is me handing her a Busy Bone, not knowing that it would snatch her away from us forever a short while later.  The guilt is killing me.  How can I write?  How can I do anything?  Grief passes they say.  But tragic memories remain fixed for a lifetime.  And what makes things worse in this case is that Greta's death could have been prevented.<br /> Though both Winston and Greta liked the Busy Bone, several times in the past Greta had gagged on it.  So, I served her a smaller portion each time, which, after careful observation I assumed resolved the problem.  In retrospect I should have responded more to the concerns Lori expressed over this potential danger to begin with.  In a brief moment, while we were in another room, Greta died because of your product.  And why should such a product even exist?  Why wasn't it at least labeled as a choking hazard?  Why didn't Purina conduct the adequate safety research before releasing this product to the stores?<br /> The answer is self-evident: Gross negligence.  A negligence which has caused the death of not only our beloved Greta and other dogs, but has now indelibly left its mark in Lori's and my life.  We'll never be able to erase the painful images seared into our minds of her lying still on the floor.  I lie awake at night thinking about it now, as well as remembering digging her grave in our backyard through such anguish that even I, a writer, cannot express in words.  It's now the closest we can get to our special friend.  We are utterly distraught.  Greta, only 2 ¬Ω years-old, healthy and in her prime, a wonderful, loving companion, is gone forever.  It's a horrid loss that cannot be replaced - thanks to Purina.<br /> The very least Purina can do is pull all forms of the Busy Bone from the market immediately, and to conduct adequate, responsible research in the future before releasing any Purina product.<br /><br /> Karl and Lori<br /> Former owners of beloved Greta, purebred female pug.  Our baby.  Gone forever."
negative,30/1/21,"I had used this frequently on and off over the years and didn't realize that it is not sold in the US any longer.  In the past the instructions were in English on the packet but I don't recall what they were. Now it is entirely in German and no one I know speaks a word of the language. I don't have a scanner so one of the solutions suggested won't work.  Don't buy before realizing that if you don't speak German and have no one to translate you are in a pickle.. I have 10 packs now!  Another thing, all 10 packs expire in 6 months time, so don't buy in bulk unless you plan to eat a lot of sauerbraten.  Rated 1 only because I am unable to use the product and the product description does not mention either the language issue or the near term expiration date."

negative,15/1/21,"Arm & Hammer's baking soda is aluminum free, they just don't write it on their packaging.<br /><br />I wasn't sure so I called them and they said there is no aluminum in it, and they would have to state it if there was because people take the product internally.  This leads me to believe that there just isn't aluminum in baking soda.  And researching it showed me that there might have been in the past, but not anymore and not for a long time.<br /><br />I resent that Bob's Red Mill writes ""Aluminum Free"" on their package and then charges a premium for their product.  It's also arsenic free, I hope.  If they label it ""Arsenic Free"" will we assume other brands aren't?  I don't like that kind of marketing."
negative,6/3/21,All baking soda is aluminum free. This is an unnecessary marketing ploy to get you to buy their product. Buy this because it is naturally mined and is cruelty free; but do not be duped into thinking that good ole $.59 Arm&Hammer has aluminum in it. BTW the chemical process used to make A&H is almost exactly what occurs in nature; just faster but not cheaper. It costs no more to mine sodium bicarbonate than it does to manufacture. So yes you are paying for a name.
negative,8/6/21,"I just called Bob's Red Mill customer service (just do a G search for the company, their customer service number is under ""contact us"" on their site), and I was annoyed to learn that NONE OF BOB'S RED MILL BAKING SODA CONTAINS ALUMINUM. I've been paying $10-15 (with shipping) for this magical 'aluminum free' baking soda only to learn that the Bob's Red Mill 'premium baking soda' at my local grocery is the same exact thing. Call for yourself if you don't believe me. Ugh."
negative,7/1/21,I was very unhappy when this package arrived at my workplace. The bags were not wrapped for shiping and was damage in route.  When I opened the box the baking soda was spiling all over the place.  I could not identify where the many holes were and did not have acess to a container to put them in so I threw it away.  I made a mess all over the place  What a waste.  I will not be ordering from this company again.
negative,17/4/21,"What constitutes a good coffee is rather subjective. You can read countless reviews about it, but you don't know until you've tried it for yourself.  Having enjoyed peaberry coffee (I think the spherical shape results in better roasting) from many different parts of the world , I gave this a shot based on the positive reviews posted and the great price.  Boy, was I disappointed!  The beans are light/medium in roast, has a mild subdued smell.  The beans looked dry, but this is not uncommon for light roasts.  I made a fine grind of the beans, and brewed it in a press. Sad to say, it was the most disappointing cup of coffee I have had in a long time.  The flavor was stale, without any fruity characteristic of peaberries, and reminded me of a cheap cup of joe from a dirty diner.  The worst part is I am stuck with 3 lbs of terrible coffee that cannot be returned (Amazon does not accept return of food items)."
negative,10/3/21,"My reason for the low rating is that there was no ""use by"" date on the bag, making it difficult to know if the beans were old and not well cared for or if that's just the way Tanzanian peaberry beans roast up.  Not sure how a manufacturer gets away without putting a date on their products, but this supplier has found some way to get around it.  The coffee does taste good, although a hint of staleness exists, but the beans are totally dry: no oil, no moisture is present when they are ground.  I've enjoyed peaberry coffees from Hawaii for years, peaberries are the best of the best beans.  I've also come to enjoy African coffees for their full yet mild taste. So, to find peaberry coffee from Tanzania at such a great price was too much to pass up.  I expect to finish up the coffee I've purchased, but probably wouldn't buy it again or buy any coffee from this supplier since I have no assurance of its freshness."
negative,14/1/21,"I rarely post a product review, but I feel that I would be irresponsible as a consumer if I did not comment on the Tanzania Peaberry whole coffee beans. I had high hopes when purchasing this coffee and I did my best to tolerate them. To illustrate, I have consumed almost one whole bag of the three, but will have to dump the other two in the trash! The beans are stale, dry, over-roasted, with little flavor. Even loading up the coffee with sugar does not seem to help! I resolved that this morning would be my last cup! I will have to resort to buying the Eight O'Clock brand at my local grocery store. I even briefly considered giving the two unopened bags to a friend, but decided that it wasn't worth alienating him! Coffee Bean Direct, you need to do better, MUCH better..."
negative,24/5/21,"Regular Reduced fat milk from Horizon received slightly over a month away from the expiration date. My intention was to buy Whole milk but the product description is confusing. I sent an email to the customer support - no response, after 3 weeks I checked and found that they made the picture larger (good) but left the product description without change.<br />As for me, it is crazy expensive shipping while I can get same Fat free or Reduced fat milk at StopNShop or Market Basket. The difficult thing is to find whole milk. Funny that Whole milk as natural product became unpopular. I guess too many people are concerned about becoming overweight:)"
negative,14/10/21,"Once again I find myself trying to like Tazo herbal teas, but they keep putting licorice in teas where is just doesn't seem to belong, to me anyway.  This is another example where I expected a lovely flavored tea and the licorice flavor is so strong, it's just about all I can taste.  I guess I'll just give up on Tazo - who ever blends all their teas has radically different taste buds than mine!"
negative,7/2/21,"This tea was not what I expected.  I love cinnamon tea and was very disappointed with this product.  The tea does not have a strong cinnamon flavor which I enjoy.  This tea has a stronger Rooibos flavor than cinnamon flavor.  Furthermore, I found that the product description does not give a full list of the tea's ingredients.<br /><br />The ingredients listed on the box include:  Cinnamon, Licorice Root, Orange Peel, Indian Sarsaparilla, Chicory Root, Rooibos, Natural Flavors, Star Anise, Almond Extract and Locorice Extract"
negative,29/3/21,"Wow, very weird taste.  I typically like all the ingredients, but this mix just tastes wrong.  It's somewhat similar to sarsaparilla tea, but with a licorice aftertaste.  It isn't so bad that I couldn't finish the first cup, but not my cup of tea."
negative,17/4/21,"Well I bought this item before and enjoyed it immensely. Pink Salmon is very good for you.<br /><br />This time I ordered again, received ALBACORE TUNA INSTEAD OF PINK SALMON. AMAZON DOES NOT DO RETURNS ON GROCERIES SUCH AS THESE, EVEN IF NOT OPENED THAT I CAN SEE. I sent personally an email to Raincoast Trading Company based in Canada, also left a phone message as well. Delayed response, but finally got emails and they were courteous but they redirected me to try help center to get credit and get the correct item. Gone through hoops in the help center of Amazon to no avail. Until I found the Toll Free Amazon phone number, Amazon LLC confirmed they can not accept the return, but will send the correct item promptly. We shall see, awaiting a replacement item.<br />A minor complaint they are smaller can sizes than the normal pink salmon I am used to ordering.<br />Anyone want some tuna? O well.<br /><br />P.S. Updated  review Sept 30th 2009, I finally got the ordered item, partly because the Amazon rep corrected it when I called in and sent it fast! BTW, it cost me a Toll Call to Canada to the company without a prompt reply. That just added insult to injury. Well I was able to order from a different merchant through Amazon. Thank you Amazon for coming through :)"

negative,27/1/21,"My cat has an iron stomach. She can eat absolutely anything and everything and is always getting into my ""human"" food and has never thrown up. I gave her 2 of these treats and within 20 minutes, she was wheezing and throwing up all over my carpet. I didn't connect it at first but when I gave her the same treats the next day, exact same reaction!<br /><br />I have tried several different flavors of this same brand and she has had the same reaction! If you are trying these with your cat for the 1st time, only give them 1 of them and just wait to see how they react before you give them anymore."
negative,1/6/21,"Both of my cats (age 11) threw up for an extended period after eating just 3 of these. Into the trash they go (not the cats, the treats). Not sure what they were reacting to but thought it would be good to let other cat parents know the risk."
negative,20/8/21,"My sweet little Persian looks like she is dying. She's been puking all night because of these treats. How has this item not been recalled?"
negative,14/8/21,I have two cats. My big boy has eaten these and never had a problem...as a matter of fact he has never vomited or had a hair ball since I adopted him at 2 months. My girl cat throws up every time she eats this particular flavor. Since I treat them equally these are no longer purchased. I hate to see my girl sick so I just recommend you watch your cats after you give them these treats. If not a problem...carry on.
negative,21/4/21,"I've tried it with both my cats, several times. Every time they eat this, and other Whiskas Temptations products, they vomit within minutes.<br />They LOVE it, they WANT it, it's CHEAP but it makes them puke, so, I'd consider this a bad purchase."
negative,1/4/21,"I don't want anyone to think this is an unfair review of the product, it's more of a warning from my own personal experience so others don't make a mistake.<br /><br />When I got my new kitten from the humane society they sent him home with a goodie bag that happened to include these treats. I started feeding them to him and he seemed to like it. Then I noticed he would vomit occasionally. It was only after closer inspection did I realize these treats are for cats 6 MONTHS AND OLDER. I'm sure there's a reason for this, they caused his vomiting. I switched to a different temptations medley and he hasn't vomited since. So keep in mind, there IS a reason they limit these to older cats, they really aren't kitten safe. I only wish my humane society realized this before sending them home with him. I can only imagine they feed these to all the cats in their care without reading the package."
negative,17/4/21,"I finally did the research on this temptation treats and I'm glad to see that my suspicions are correct. I have been buying this treats for my kitty for years and suspected them all along to be the cause of him vomiting. Ironically, I even bought the hairball ones to see if they would make him stop vomiting. Now is official, I stopped giving them to him as often, and then monitored him whenever I gave him any. It soon became clear to me that he only vomits whenever I give him this treats. Sometimes he would vomit within minutes, and other times he would vomit during the night or the next morning, but if I give him this treats, I'm sure to be cleaning up orangee throw up off my carpet soon after.  I think is a matter of allergy or sensitivity to one of the ingredients, and they probably don't do anything to other cats but I'm never buying this again for my kitty."
negative,10/3/21,"You know, I was searching the Internet for the words ""temptations"" and ""vomit"" when I came across these reviews.  I was surprised to hear that I'm not the only one who has had problems with this product.  Within an hour of eating these treats my cat vomits for about 40 minutes.  I didn't realize it was the cause until the second time I fed them to her.  It's really bad because it doesn't cause the cat to throw up all at once.  It's like she can just vomit a little at a time and you're forced to follow her around cleaning up all the vomit ((or locking her in the bathroom (which is horrible))."
negative,22/4/21,"I have fed my 2 cats these treats the last 2 days.  Within 5 minutes of eating them, they are both throwing up.  I will be going back to the Three Dog Bakery Treats.  Expensive but have never made my cats sick.  Why is the company not responding to so many bad reviews?"
negative,25/4/21,"i've never written an amazon review before, but this product was so horrible i had to warn would be buyers; i can eat pretty much anything, but i had to empty out both bottles... it just tasted like colored sugar water (very thin), sickening sweet.. don't know if there was any onion flavoring.. the only reason i bought this is because i couldn't get ken's steakhouse vidalia onion dressing shipped in California.

negative,17/4/21,"I wanted to like this coffee, I did. We've tried other Wolfgang Puck K-Cups and have been pleasantly surprised. This just did not impress us. Bitter aftertaste, and it has an almost sickeningly vanilla flavor. Smells great while brewing, but just does not live up to it in the cup.

I wrongly assumed that Jamaican coffee would be similar to the Blue Mountain coffee which Jamaica is known for! How silly of me to assume that! I hate flavored coffees so I was so disappointed to now own 2 boxes of such a horrible coffee. It only says flavored very small on the box so I didn't notice it before I opened it. Hopefully I can pawn it off to visitors and buy some regular bold coffee-flavored coffee for myself!"

Since I drink my coffee from a thermal cup, I can tell you that taking that last drink to find your mouth full of coffee grounds stinks.<br /><br />I have had to throw out at least 6 cups of coffee.  Its a bit like Russian Roulette, and I've started straining it after I brew it.<br /><br />I know that its not my brewer because it is not happening with the Green Mountain, Timothy's or Tully's that I also use.  The good cups are a bit weak for my taste, but the flavor is ok.  Definitely prefer not to waste $'s on a product with a manufacturing defect."
negative,25/5/21,This was the nastiest flavored coffee I have ever had in kcups. I purchase many different kinds of flavored coffee and caramel is my favorite but this one made me gag. It smelled like buttery cheese and the taste was not what I expected. I will stick to gloria jeans and timothys flavored coffees. This was my first wolfgang puck kcup and will be the last I order of his brand. I thought maybe I got a bad cup but I brewed 3 and I opened the other box and tried those since it comes with two boxes and same nastiness.

I wish the descriptions of the coffees offered by Amazon were clearer so that there is no confustion as to what you are purchasing. Even the name of the product is a little deceptive since one might assume that it is Jamaican coffee.
negative,25/5/21,"I use to purchase Jamaica beans locally and it was great. This Jamaica me crazy is nothing close to it. The odor is terrible and it tastes like the coffee is flat or stale. Other people in household tried it and couldn't get past the first cup. Pitched the remainder cups in the trash."
negative,22/5/21,"This coffee tastes very flavorful and is not too strong, but I have to say it almost ruined my months' old Keurig Personal Brewer. The coffee is ground so finely that when the K-Cups are punctured by the needles (top and bottom), it gets packed into the needles and also sifts out through the holes made by the needles, going into the coffee cup creating a very nasty ""sludge"" in the bottom of each cup. I purchased a pack of 2 (48 K-Cups) and didn't even use one full pack. I do not recommend this brand or blend. It is a waste of money, which is something I couldn't really afford at this time. I sent a letter of complaint to the Wolfgang Puck company and, except for a ""cookie cutter"" letter acknowledging receipt of my comment, I have not received any further contact from them."
negative,19/7/21,"Unfortunately, I'm much too frugal to throw away something I've spent perfectly good money on, so I'm continuing to use these suckers until they're gone (hopefully in a few weeks). I thought I was buying a decent brand of coffee, given the Wolfgang Puck name, but alas, I was wrong. Using the middle cup size on my Keurig coffeemaker, these k-cups make a weak cup of coffee... more like brown water. No taste, no nothing. I switched to the smallest size cup and it's marginally better, but still barely drinkable. I wouldn't serve these to guests EVER. I can't wait to be done with these boxes of junk so I can order something with some taste. Please don't waste your money."
negative,7/9/21,"The aroma is pleasant, and flavor is nice and smooth, but it is very, very weak.  I really wanted to like this one as there are very few available on subscribe and save, but I just cannot recommend it.  Even making smaller cups it is very weak.  I'm going to stick to Newman's Own Organics Extra Bold as my go to k-cup for now."
negative,25/8/21,"I admit, I am not terribly fond of flavored coffees. But, this one is not for us. We both love the Rodeo Drive. I have a good freind that loves this coffee. I sent her ours."
negative,6/9/21,"I am definitely not a coffee connoisseur, but this stuff is bad.  It is a disappointment because I expected a Wolfgang Puck product to have more ""class.""  This tastes artificial and it can't stand alone without tons of cream and sweetener.  Will not buy again!"
negative,25/5/21,The coffee tasted bitter and like it was burnt.  I cleaned the machine and it still tasted bitter and burnt.  Will not order this again.
negative,7/9/21,"I'm amazed that people are happy with this product.  I'm not a drinker of the dark brews, French roast or anything, but even for a drinker of a milder cup of coffee, this is completely tasteless.  The initial scent is delicious, too bad none of it shows up in the actual coffee."
negative,13/10/21,"To me this coffee was extremely bitter.  I dumped it out and made a different cup.  It made me afraid to try other WP coffees but I did like the WP Sumatra Kopi Raya.<br /><br />For reference purposes my in store drink is a Starbucks Americano.<br /><br />My favorite k-cups are:<br />Starbucks French Roast<br />Starbucks Caffe Verona<br />Starbucks Pike Place Roast<br />Green Mountain Xtra Bold Sumatran Reserve<br />Green Mountain Double Black Diamond<br />Green Mountain Revv<br />Green Mountain Dark Magic<br /><br />Other k-cups I've tried:  Coffee People Jet Fuel ,Green Mountain Dark Magic Decaf, Emeril Jazzed up Decaf, Starbucks Caffe Verona, Coffee People Black Tiger,  Starbucks House Blend, Starbucks Breakfast Blend, Starbucks Sumatra, Wolfgang Puck French Roast, Green Mountain Lake and Lodge, Green Mountain French Roast, Caribou Mahogony, Wolfgang Puck Sumatra Kopi Raya, Emeril Big Easy Bold"
negative,2/10/21,"This Wolfgang Puck Coffee Jamaica Me Crazy is the worst coffee I've ever had!<br />I threw it out right away after one sip! It taste like all coconut flavoring.<br />Hard to believe someone thought this taste good and was marketable. They should be fired!"
negative,23/9/21,Ugh... no where on the Amazon page for this item did it state that it was Hazelnut flavored.  I have been choking this down for a month just trying to get through it.  Thought it was going to be a Blue Mountain-like Jamaican coffee...
negative,26/6/21,This coffee is only mediocre in quality. I do not like a highly acidic coffee nor do I like it when the coffee outdates within 6 weeks of the order date. The only reason I am not more dissatified with this lousy coffee is that I paid very little for it by using a credit I had at amazon payments. I do not recommend this coffee.
negative,25/5/21,"If Keurig brewers were evaluated by this particular K-Cup, Keurig would be out of business. Wolfgang Puck - French Roast Melange Francais is inexcusably terrible coffee. Aroma hints of singed oak leave and the top note is simply bitter.  Mid taste is like the bottom ounces of a days old Kwiki-Mart carafe.  Mouth feel is harsh and leaves an appalling coating. The after taste leads one to immediately brush ones teeth.  I simply couldn't believe my Keurig was capable of making such a bad cup of coffee, so I tried again a week later with same results. I use average-to-good filtered water and have no problems with other brands like Green Mountain, Tulleys, nor Emeril's. Everyone I know that has a Keurig learned of it via word of mouth or a shared cup. Usually the results are stunning, and the Keurig invasion lives on.  When I share I'll stick with offering The Coffee Peoples' Black Tiger or Jet Fuel. Now I have 22 more WP/FR K-cups sitting in the bottom draw of my china cabinet to get rid of. Let me know if you want them, as I'd be embarrassed to even give them away.  Sorry Wolfgang, but what the Puck - your French Roast is unpardonably horrible, and at K-cup prices I'll not be duped again. I'll stay away from any of the other WP offerings."
negative,7/9/21,"This stuff tasted like pipe tobacco smells. My Son didn't like it either and I ended up throwing it out."
negative,15/7/21,No thanks.  Kind of bitter and has slight overtone of cardboard.  Organic Bold and Donut Shop are still our faves.
negative,3/6/21,"Wolfgang Puck's ""Breakfast in Bed"" is a much more flavorful and robust medium roast than this one."
negative,27/9/21,"This is not regular coffee as the description would lead you to believe... it's artificially flavored, and it appears from the other ratings that you either love the flavor or hate it. My household hated it. Of course, that would be my problem if the description was accurate, but it's not. Amazon refunded my money and said someone would check the information on the product page."
negative,19/6/21,"As coffee, these kcups are just ok.  As ""flavored"" coffee these are disappointing.  I found the vanilla to be barely detectable."
negative,25/5/21,"Are these people crazy or can I not multiple properly? This is $43 for 24 small cups of peaches.  That works out to $7 for the 4 pack.  This 4 pack cost about $3.50 in a grocery store in the states but because I'm deployed I'm suppose to pay $7 for it?! Not happening. Netgrocer.com is $4.00; higher than a grocercy store, but cheaper than this!"
negative,7/9/21,Product has a shelf life of two years and was labeled as produced in December of 2009. Product leaked from seal in carton.
negative,3/8/21,"I am not happy about writing this review. I had very high expectations from both the name and the high praise given by the other reviewers. I was at once concerned, however, based on the weak aroma at first opening. And, these initial concerns were confirmed at first use... little flavor here. I have found a home recipe based off of the ingredient list with stuff from my spice rack produces a much better result.<br /><br />Beef Rub: Brown sugar, sea salt, paprika, chille, rosemary, fresh garlic, chipotle powder, cumin, and McCormick Montreal Steak Seasoning.<br /><br />Chicken Rub: Brown sugar, paprika, sea salt, chille, McCormick Montreal Chicken Seasoning, curry, garlic, cinnamon, and Chinese Five Spices."
negative,5/9/21,"Medaglia D'Oro has to be the worst coffee I've ever had. It had an old musty flavor and odor. You get what pay for."
negative,25/5/21,"t may be expresso grind, but if you are expecting lovely dark aromatic coffee for your espresso maker: think again. Bitter when drunk on own. Marginally better when combined with milk in cappuchino. I shoulda known betta!"
negative,7/9/21,"These jelly beans were very unusual when they showed up.  They came in a package without a jelly belly logo, the jelly beans themselves had no jelly belly logo, and I don't really know if they were actually jelly bellys.  I got them as a gift, so I didn't try any of them, but it was odd giving a gift where it didn't seem like they were anything special, like I'd bagged up some licorice jelly beans from the grocery store or something, big woop...so I was disappointed.  And because they were a gift I had no idea what they tasted like.  So were they really jelly bellys?  Who knows?  I felt silly giving them though."
negative,11/9/21,"I would not buy this particular Yogi Tea again because I hate the taste of licorice/anise.  The flavor of the licorice and fennel seed is very dominant, making it a sort of sickly sweet flavor which wasn't what I was hoping for with my burning throat.  I think a better blend would be something with more ""heat"" like ginger, which is why I usually drink Yogi's Cold Season instead, for the same purpose.<br /><br />With a sore throat, its reasonable to suffer through a yucky flavor if it makes a discernible difference but this tea didn't do that."
negative,13/7/21,"I ordered this for my birthday. I got birthday money from family, and I ordered a couple of goodies, perfume, and this cocoa.  I love hot chocolate, and I'm always looking for new ones to try.  Based on the first review I decided to go ahead and order.  I will probably not reorder.  Mixed by itself into hot water it seems to lack thickness.  It also has too much of an artificial raspberry taste.  I like Hershey's Bliss Raspberry Chocolate much better.  I've been adding one spoonful of the Cobblestone Kitchen to my regular cocoa to give it a raspberry boost.  But, by itself, it does not stand up to the test. I plan on finishing the three remaining cans over time by using it as a stir in additive to other cocoa."
negative,22/7/21,"My first time having Curry Rice.<br /><br />But boy, I cooked this stuff exactly how you're supposed to.<br /><br />Taste...wasn't bad, I guess, a little ""Strong"" though.<br /><br />IT was thick, like ice slush...it was over-bearing and the spice was pretty intense.<br /><br />I don't think I'll get it again...I guess it's good stuff, seen it in some curry making videos...used often, but...not for me, as it it is way to thick.<br /><br />I had potatoes, onions, and pork prepared to perfection mixed with it...and I could not taste them, at all. I could not taste the pork, or anything. Only the Sauce."
negative,22/6/21,"We tried this formula because it is lactose free, my baby does not have any other issues, just lactose intolerant.<br />We found that it smells bad, does not mix well into water and my baby would not drink a drop."
negative,28/7/21,"Good idea but the company should use a better soil compound.  Maybe darker.  It's hard to tell if the soil is wet or dry.  Present compound blows away when I water it.  Finally sprouted and I'll transpant to a regular top soil when it grows more.  At least with soil, you can tell when it's dry.  Right now, I will give it small amounts of water weekly until that happens.  Very disappointed with this product."
negative,13/10/21,"I bought two bags of these, thinking it was the same product that I used to buy in different packaging (light blue, with a see-through dog shape against a grass green background). Unfortunately, it was completely not the same thing! These treats were actually like jerky-- tough and brittle. I give my dog soft treats because he doesn't chew the damn things, and he choked on these horrible things; I had to toss them out.<br /><br />Note that the ""Zuke's Jerky Naturals"" with the other packaging (http://www.amazon.com/Zukes-Jerky-Naturals-Beef/dp/B00008DFPY) have always been moist and soft, and I've never had a problem with those. I suspect that this batch was not new packaging, as I had thought, but very old packaging; these may be the same treats I usually feed my dog, just having sat on a shelf for years. In any case, these were COMPLETELY different treats, and not safe to feed my dog."
negative,19/2/21,"Under the product features it says all meats are sourced in the USA. I got the Lamb and Rice jerky today and it says on the package the Lamb comes from New Zealand. That's a huge misrepresentation of this product on the product page. Very disappointed."
negative,14/12/20,"My chihuahuas like this treat, but they do not eat it with enthusiasm. They hesitate and let it sit quite often."
negative,14/12/20,"I purchased two of these and they arrived with the package split and the items all over the box. I contacted Amazon and they sent two more out, these also arrived with the packages open. Amazon was very courteous and professional as always, I cannot review the item itself because the packaging is so horrible that I have given up on trying again."

negative,26/3/21,"These pods are rather bland. I purchased them because I thought they would make a nice dessert coffee. They do not taste much different than regular coffee pods. I would not purchase them again, nor do I recommend them."
negative,24/3/21,"The particular packages had an off taste. However, the seller gave me a complete refund and didn't even make me send them back. I have ordered this item before and they were fine."
negative,24/2/21,They kept raising the price. The product was great and remained the same but they kept raising the price. This last order I have had enough and will be going back!
negative,19/2/21,"If this was called ""Medium Roast"", I would give it 4 stars. It's a good coffee.<br /><br />But this is called French Vanilla Caramel, and this review is based on the product's name.<br /><br />Let me say that vanilla and caramel are perhaps my favorite flavors... coffee, ice cream, candy, you name it... if it's vanilla or caramel, I love it.<br /><br />With the exception of this.<br /><br />Where's the vanilla? Where's the caramel? And don't get me wrong: I'm not trying to say that the flavors are too mild. I'm saying that they are NON-EXISTENT. And therefore, based on the name, this coffee gets 1 star."
negative,14/12/20,This jam has little fruit taste. If you love damson jam this is not the one for you. It could have been any flavor. All you taste is sweetness.
negative,19/10/21,"This is the first review I have ever done, but I could not let this one go bye. This was the worst ever, save your money."
negative,18/5/21,This huge bag of chocolates contained old (white and cracked) chocolates that were completely melted all over the inside of the bag!  Noone at work would even touch them since they looked so sad and gross... what a waste and disappointment!  Will be wary to ever purchase from this seller again
negative,19/2/21,"My wife really loves O.N.E Coconut Water.  I thought via auto ship would be a great way not to have to go to the store every other day to get some.  I ordered 6 cases of 12 ea.  The first problem occurred when case number one was sent back as undeliverable.  I guess a San Diego address would be undeliverable in Kentucky.  Of the 5 remaining cases all of which did arrive but in not great condition.  All the cases were still sealed but 1 had 2 of the 33.8 ounce boxes split open and there were 3 other boxes in other cases that were stale (really had a rancid smell).  Therefore I cancelled the auto ship and have gone back to picking this up in the local supermarket.  Works out better, just more time consuming and heavier.  It would have been nice knowing that the cases were in fact pretty flimsy.  My wife still loves the product."
negative,14/12/20,"First off, I didn't purchase this product through Amazon, but at a local grocery store, so my review only reflects the product itself, not Amazon in any way.  I bought this last week never having tried coconut water before, but I heard good things.  The taste of it was almost like the smell of lawn clippings that had been damp and out in the sun for a long time.  Tasted off and had a faint mold smell to it.  I didn't know if it was supposed to taste like that or not as I never tried it before, but paying as much as I did I felt obligated to finish it off.  I've been ill for about a week after drinking it.  I don't know if it was just a coincidence or the cause of it.  I did email customer service at O.N.E. the day I drank it asking if it was supposed to taste like that or if I got a bad batch, and they still haven't replied to me."
negative,1/6/21,"People watch out if you are buying this product online. I've ordered 12 bottles of the O.N.E, I was expecting this to be same as what I bought from store but this seller disappointed me, The bottles have the seal broken and the taste of the coconut water is not what I expected, I'm sure that this seller/ the person who packaged the bottles added water by breaking the seal. I've wasted my money on this product, I'll never buy this online for a few bucks cheap rather than go to the nearby store and buy it.<br /><br />my rating for this product is 0/5.<br /><br />In short, Seal broken, Diluted and Not comparable with the one that I bought from store."

I love Amazon - they have never let me down, so I am hoping they come through for me when I file a claim with them.<br /><br />The product was rock hard, so I followed the enclosed instructions and heated it even less than the recommended time in the microwave. It kneaded easily enough and smelled/ tasted good. When it came to rolling, I could tell immediately that this was going to be a challenge. Sure enough, it tore all over the place. Redo. I used cornstarch, the way I was taught, and it still stuck to every surface as if it were too warm or wet, yet cracked as if it were too dry. Nothing made it cooperate, so I lowered my standards and draped it anyway. Durring the two-foot trip from the rolling surface to the cake, it ripped in several places and the application to the cake ended in absolute disaster. No, I did not roll it too thin. Yes, I used cornstarch (even though the packaging specifically claims it is unnecessary.) It sucks. The end."
negative,19/5/21,"This product was so easy to work with.  On 6/23/12 I made a little over 100 flowers for wedding cupcakes, the following day I did the same using a different color of Satin Ice. The flowers of both fondants were firm, I stored them in an air tight container. On 7/2/12 I opened the container of flower made with the Fondarific and they were soft.  The flowers made from Satin Ice were perfect. I left the container of Fondarific flowers open over night to see if they would harden up again, they turned out ""gummy"", you know, like chewed gum, which is probably less sticky than this mess.  I am so dissappointed in this product.  Fortunately I made my flowers early, I have time to purchase Satin Ice and make 100 more flowers.  I do not recommend this product."

negative,14/12/20,"I was excited to see that Amazon is selling 100% Kopi Luwak. However, these beans were a huge disappointment because they had no aroma and flavor at all. I'm guessing that they sent stale beans because there was no roast date printed on the bag."

The email attempted to spread the blame between Amazon, its supplier and some mysterious unknown factor, ultimately taking no real responsibility for the blunder.<br /><br />Color me frustrated and confused because while they said they are stopping all orders for the time being, their company website still shows the product in stock and ready for orders.<br /><br />This to say the least was very disappointing and more so because the company's response was very wishy washy and lame. In my experience, when a company screws up (mind you it wasn't just my order, it was a whole slew of orders that got cancelled)<br />they should own up and take responsibility thereby showing some integrity, rather than mutter some indecipherable mumbo jumbo that does nothing to explain nor solve the customers problem."

DON'T buy this product, just buy some Gushers next time you're at Wal-Mart.  2 star review because I like Gushers."
negative,11/3/21,"I dissolved an entire tab in my mouth and then ate bitter greens and it did nothing.  I added some vinegar to the greens and it did make it a tad sweeter, but it didnt make them taste good.....It makes really sour things slightly sweeter....but NO MIRACLE."
negative,10/4/21,"Maybe the miracle fruit does not work for everyone. It had very little effect when I used it. I started with a clear pallet, let the pill dissolve on my tongue etc. Then I tried the classic first, a lime. I noticed, barely, that it was not quite as pucker inducing as it may have been without the mberry but just slightly. And it did not add any ""sweet"". It just inhibited a hint of sour. Other foods like vinegar, vinegar chips, Guinness, strawberries, cheese, etc. Many recommended fruits and foods have very little impact. And after just a few minutes, I could notice any change.<br /><br />So, either, some people just don't have the same level of effect or much of the miracle berry effects are group dynamics and heightened suggestibility. Either way, they were a let down."

negative,2/2/20,"You think you're doing something good for your kid when you invest a little more to get an organic formula.  Sadly, that's not the case here.  This is a horrifically constipating formula...lots of pain and straining, guaranteed.  Having to take measures to prevent this (offering juices, water, etc) is just not a sensible approach.<br /><br />Also, the manufacturers use sucrose instead of lactose to save money, and they use a LOT of it.  With the same sweetness as country time lemonade, Similac Organic's sucrose-based formula may also set your child up for future diabetes.  Check the NY Times article for more info on this.<br /><br />Bottom line: painful constipation in the near term, possible diabetes and certainly a sweet tooth in the future...no, thanks!"
negative,31/8/19,"2.0 out of 5 stars Read this article first, August 11, 2009<br />By  Pregbaby (Florida) - See all my reviews<br />I thought I was doing the right thing by buying organic and thought Similac was a brand I could trust to be good for baby. That is, until I came across this NY Times article about the sugar they use... [...]<br /><br />From the article:<br /><br />Parents may be buying [Similac Organic] because they believe that organic is healthier, but babies may have a reason of their own for preferring Similac Organic: it is significantly sweeter than other formulas. It is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar, or sucrose, which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas.<br /><br />No health problems in babies have been associated with Similac Organic. But to pediatricians, there are risks in giving babies cane sugar: Sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars; once babies get used to its sweeter taste, they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods; and some studies suggest that they might overeat, leading to rapid weight gain in the first year, which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity."
negative,22/7/19,we switched from the advance similac to the organic product thinking it would be better as we prefer organic foods ourselves. it was a disaster with our 2 month old baby getting constipated and progressively worsening her intake till she fell drastically below her calorie intake. we discontinued the product within five days and switched back to the previous similac and she is fine now. her feeding and calorie intake is back to normal

I have contacted the company to see what they say.<br /><br />Also these are the corporate practices of Martek which are damaging to the environment as well written just last Dec 2011 at NaturalnewsDOTcom<br /><br />The best bet is to just avoid the lifeDHA at this time in my opinion b/c corporate america cares more about the almighty $ than your health."

negative,27/11/19,My child was exclusively breastfed for 4 1/2 months and I gradually introduced Similac Organic formula to supplement (my breastmilk started to dry up).  She found this was so much easier to eat she gave up on me by 5 1/2 months.  By the time I completely stopped nursing she was so constipated from the formula that I switched.  She winced and cried and worked so long to just produced a hard ball the size of ping pong ball.  It was horrible!  I realized I was the one helping her poo with nursing and then she lost all ability when she went full-formula.  I say switch....
negative,12/12/19,"We breastfeed our month old boy, but since his bilirubin level was still high, doctors recommended to switch to formula for 48 hours. We started with Similac Advance (Shield Plus) which we still had from hospital. First 24 hours were wonderful in terms of pooping, then we decided to switch to Similac Organic for known reasons, but during the first 32-Ounce Bottle I began to notice that his stool was getting harder, and eventually he stopped pooing (actually he produced two stone-ball like poops) and had a hard time for another 24 hours. Breast milk and Similac advance tested similarly sweet, but Similac Organic was much much less sweet. I made a research on the internet and I found the following that may help you to understand the cause of constipation: (http://www.drhull.com/EncyMaster/C/constipation_infant.html)<br /><br />Constipation means infrequent, hard stools. It does not mean grunting or straining, although your baby may certainly exhibit these behaviors when having a bowel movement. So the first question to ask is, ""Is my child really constipated?""<br /><br />Next, consider why true constipation - excessively hard, dry stools - arises. The normal function of the colon is to remove water from the stool. Otherwise we would rapidly dehydrate and die. That is why severe diarrhea is dangerous - the stool is moving through the colon and being expelled from the body so fast, there is no time to properly reabsorb the stool water back into the bloodstream.<br /><br />Conversely, if the fecal material remains in the colon too long, the water removal process may extract too much of the fecal water and leave the stool mass excessively dry and hard. It is just that simple.<br /><br />So constipation arises when feces remain in the colon too long because:<br /><br />  * the colon is naturally sluggish (has decreased ""motility,"" we say)<br />  * a low residue diet produces insufficient stimulation to the colon to trigger its normal propulsive activity and clear out the feces<br />  * a combination of the above two factors<br />  * there is obstruction of the lower GI tract<br />  o functional neurologic - the lower rectum and anus cannot properly relax to allow evacuation - Hirschprung disease<br />  o functional anatomic - anal-rectal positioning doesn't allow easy evacuation<br />  o mechanical - a tumor physically blocks stool passage<br /><br />Breast fed babies are essentially never truly constipated. This is because breast milk is such a low residue diet. Almost all of the milk is absorbed by the baby and used. The stools consist of a small amount of unabsorbed protein curds and a large amount of bowel secretions, chiefly mucus. And of course a lot of noisy gas. But these infrequent stools do not indicate constipation - just infrequent stools.<br /><br />Later, when breast feeding infants start solids, they technically can become constipated, but it is unusual in my experience. It is not until the child is pretty much on solids and especially when weaned to whole cow milk that constipation is much of an issue. By then we are really discussing toddlers.<br /><br />Breast fed infants do tend to save up after the first few months and poop less often. This worries some parents. Despite reassurances to the contrary, some folks just have to see a poop every day from their little darling to be happy and fulfilled. Go figure. They forget that stool can stay in the colon for a very, very long time and it will not hurt anything.<br /><br />When the stool hoarding breast feeder does finally get ready to go, another problem comes to the fore: grunting and straining. When the baby's rectum forms in utero, it is in a state of permanent contraction for nigh onto nine months. The baby does not pass the meconium (fetal stool) in utero until perhaps right at the end of gestation right before, during or after delivery. Until the baby is several months old, and has passed and been stretched by quite a few bowel movements, the rectum and particularly the anus may be quite tight and resist easy dilation to allow the stool to pass. Because the baby has weak, flabby abdominal musculature (that is why his little tummy is so poochy), he must push against this tight anal spincter with his diaphragm. Just as Mom pushed during delivery, and with seemingly equal discomfort. Hence the grunting and red-faced straining.<br /><br />  The other major problem of both breast or bottle fed newborns which creates this sort of straining is dyschezia, or uncoordinated stooling.<br /><br />The cure for the problem of a tight anus is pretty simple: a gentle rectal exam with a well-lubricated pinky finger by the doctor (which should be done on all babies with stooling troubles anyway to rule out a physical obstruction) will be both diagnostic and curative. If one such gentle dilation doesn't do the trick, I have Mom bring the baby back in a week and repeat the procedure. The anal spincter is stretched, and pretty soon, no more terrible straining.<br />Top<br /><br />Bottle fed infants are ""a whole 'nother story."" Infant formulas are not nearly as well digested as breast milk, and leave quite a bit more residue in the colon. (The exception to this rule in my mind is the new Similac¬Æ that really does seem to leave the stools about the same consistency as breast milk.) So true constipation in bottle fed infants is much more common; my feeling is that soy formulas are even worse than cow milk based formulas in this regard.<br /><br />The young infant's colon is simply not designed for all the residue and stool bulk. The residue builds up, is dried too much, and becomes hard, pebbly stool. It is naturally difficult and uncomfortable for the baby to pass.<br /><br />The addition of cereal to the diet only compounds whatever problems already exist. Cereal + milk = concrete. Cereal in the formula bottle seems to be especially bad, probably because parents don't realise just how much cereal the baby is getting.<br />Top<br /><br />Treatment of constipation mainly involves common sense diet modifications and sometimes medication:<br /><br />  * Again, as with breast fed babies, a search for the cause of the constipation and gentle rectal exam can work wonders.<br />  * I use a lot of Karo¬Æ corn syrup for bottle feeders with constipation. It is my first choice recomendation; it almost always works if used properly. Unfortunately, many doctors and nurses don't use it properly, get poor results, and don't recommend it as often as they should. I start with two measuring teaspoons in every formula bottle, regardless of size, and adjust the dose up or down depending on how things are going. Usually, the baby can be weaned off the Karo pretty soon, but may need to stay on it periodically for the first few months of life. It is very important to put the corn syrup in the formula and not give it in between in water. The excess corn syrup does not get digested very well - the baby is already digesting all the sugar he can from the formula. The excess sugar passes down to the colon and produces a sugar diarrhea similar to sorbitol (as below, prunes, apple juice).<br /><br />  Before scolding me about ""the risk of botulism"" from corn syrup, please see:<br /><br />  Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Volume 4,Number 3,September 2003: ""Pediatric neurologic potpourri: cases to remember""<br /><br />  ""In the past, C. botulinum was also found in corn syrup, but this is no longer a risk factor for infant botulism because of a recent change in the processing formula.""<br /><br />  For the complete source of statement, see: Olsen SJ, Swerdlow DL. Risk of infant botulism from corn syrup. In reply. Pediatr Infect Dis J 2000;19:584-5.<br /><br />  * Certain fruits and juices - for example prunes, apple juice, apricots - are rich in sorbitol, a nondigestible sugar that passes through the body to the colon and causes water to be retained or drawn into the stool mass. They can be increased in the diet to loosen the stool and relieve or prevent constipation.<br />  * Lactulose is a non-absorbable sugar product that is processed by colon bacteria to produce an inflow of water into the stool mass. We use it a lot - it seems to be a favorite of our local pediatric gastroenterologists. The dose is adjusted up or down according to respose. Side effects are usually not serious but can include cramping or diarrhea - obviously, stop the medicine and call your doctor if these occur.<br />  * Glycerine suppositories are helpful to relieve your child if there is some hard stool that just won't come out easily. The suppository melts in the heat of the rectum and lubricates the stool. Glycerine also has a mild effect of attracting water into the stool, which softens it. The act of insertion also serves to stimulate the rectum and anus to initiate the defecation reflex. (Glycerine is completely safe - it is a food, found in candy, not a drug.)<br />  * Fiber containing foods are helpful for older children and adults, but are not really of much use in the treatment of young infant constipation, for dietary reasons: babies just don't eat a lot of fiber. (I believe ISoyalac¬Æ, which was a high fiber soy formula, has been discontinued. It was never very available any place I practiced, anyway.)<br /><br />Top<br /><br />Myths and misconceptions concerning infant constipation:<br /><br />  * Iron in the formula causes constipation. No way. I can understand lay people thinking this to be the case because when adults take iron preparations (in large doses) they may become constipated. But the tiny amount present in infant formula is not nearly enough to cause any problems.<br /><br />  The irritating thing to me is to hear doctors and nurses who should know better repeating this nonsense and switching the infants to the less healthy low- or no-iron formulas.<br /><br />  * Increasing water in the diet is commonly recommended; it makes very little sense and demonstrates a failure to reflect on the basic physiologic cause of the overdry stool. The problem is too little water retention in the stool, not too little water in the body! Unless there is increased fiber or some chemical substance such as a sugar (Karo¬Æ, lactulose) to retain the water in the stool, excess water will simply wind up in the diaper as urine.<br /><br />Top"
negative,26/9/20,"Do not buy this product.  You will not be doing your infant any favors.  If at all possible, you should be breastfeeding.  (I know it's not always easy or convenient.)  If you can't then in my opinion the best formula is Earth's Best and even that is disappointing.  Basically, they dry cow's milk and remove all the natural nutrients then ""fortify"" with synthetic vitamins/minerals.  Pathetic.  Just buy whole organic milk, raw if possible.  There are recipes online to make it closer to human breast milk.  Sorry to be so matter of fact.  I'm losing patience for all these evil corporations capitalizing on the ""green"" movement.

It tasted stale when you opened the bag and even worse when you drank it.  It was definitely off.  He bought 5 bags and every one we tried was the same.  I would never buy another.  We had bought another brand in a tin from Jamaica which was fine.  I think this is a con.  You get all the rubbish about it being tested in Jamaica, well I dont know who tests it but definitely not someone who likes good coffee.  I just dont understand how people say its any good. Maybe having paid so much for it its like the emperor's new clothes."

Now that pork rinds can be considered a health snack I bought this box thinking I could have a decent snack every day. Well they pop up great in a large enough microwave. The issue is the seasoning. There is way way way too much salt in the seasoning and adding additional hot sauce makes the experience that much more unenjoyable.<br /><br />I now have these when I am pretty hungry and want to bring compact snack to a place where I know there will be a microwave but I will not be ordering these again once the box is finished.<br /><br />Oh and they aren't hot nor spicy.

The MSG also heightens the very salty taste. This item did puff up very nicely in the microwave, but it was inedible because of the saltiness and all 18 packages had to be thrown out.

negative,25/9/21,The hot chocolate is fine but the price here is crazy.  You can get the same thing on the Keurig site for under $15.
negative,19/10/21,"I had high hopes for the convenience of this product.  My daughter LOVES hot chocolate. This really was a total disappointment.  I threw these kcups out.  If you use the smallest setting on your Keurig, you get 3 oz of watery hot chocolate.  Larger settings are not drinkable.<br /><br />Save your money and get cocoa packets or a good tin of hot cocoa - and take advantage of the instant hot water the keurig provides."
negative,4/9/21,"I was expecting a bit better after reading other reviews. This is about the same as any other hot chocolate made with water. I prefer making it with milk as the flavor and texture is much better. Adding milk didn't help much. I guess Mom spoiled me (good)."
negative,31/8/21,"This is some of the worst stuff I've ever tried to drink. It's even worse than that awful stuff that comes out of those machines where the cup drops down and fills it. I tried it on the various cup size settings with my Keurig machine and it just goes from bad to horrible when going from the larger size to the smallest.<br /><br />It's a complete waste of money.<br /><br />I just tried another brand that's similar and it's no good either. If you like chocolate water, buy these. If you have it in mind that you are buying ""Hot Chocolate"" with a milky or creamy flavor... that's not what this stuff is.<br /><br />Yuck!"
negative,9/10/21,"This time, forget ordering through Amazon.  You can get the same product, 24 K-Cups for $12.75 at Big Cat or for $14.80 at Keurig.  These prices are a rip off."
negative,15/6/21,I used the small cup setting and even opened up the cap and scraped the excess mix out of the cup and it is still very weak tasting.
negative,4/8/21,"I LOVE Green Mountain coffee.  I use it all the time for my k cups.  I got a sample of the Green Mountain Hot Cocoa and thought it would be the best.  I actually threw it out.  I tried several times to drink it.  It tasted bitter and like chemicals.  I have tried samples of the other brands of hot cocoa and this by far was the worst.  I was so surprised because I adore their coffee.  I personally would not recommend this.  Maybe it is the soy I don't know.  It just tasted very, very odd.  I still would recommend their coffees though!  Just to be fair I did add chocolate redi whip.  But I add that to all of my hot cocoa and it always tastes good."
negative,15/6/21,"We fed this to our bulldog when she was a puppy, and at first she did wonderful. Then the corn and preservatives took their toll.... She was itching and had a chronic ear infection and her face had a terrible yeasty smell ALL the time. She licked her paws constantly and scratched her face raw on any surface she could find. Then she started vomiting. We HAD to change her food. Now she eats a fully carnivorous raw diet and is thriving! No more itching, no more ear infections, no more yeast, no more paw licking."
negative,4/8/21,I wanted to give this product a try as the liquid honey crystallized in a few weeks during the winter months. This small 8 oz. packet does clump together a lot more than other sweeteners so there is less of an advantage over using honey in a jar and spooning out the crystallized honey.<br /><br />For the price I consider it a poor value. Taste is OK but nothing to rave about and not as good as with regular unprocessed honey.
negative,15/6/21,"This is basically candy masquerading as a ""healthy"" snack. They taste good - because they have three different kinds of sugar in them! Blue Diamond  wants you to think that eating sugar is a healthy snack - c'mon!<br /><br />I purchased these thinking they were sweetened with stevia. Yeah, there's a miniscule amount of stevia (very last ingredient) - but sugars are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ingredient listed. These have corn maltodextrin - the worst thing there is on the glycemic index (can you say fat formation?). Now I'm stuck with 3 containers of this sugar snack."
negative,4/8/21,"I purchased 2 other types of Blue Diamond almonds on the same day, and they were both around $11 for a pack of 3. T his one was only ONE 8 oz. container, and I assumed it was at least 2-3 containers since the cost was over $8."
negative,1/10/21,"The delivery was extremely quick, the packaging was fine, and if you suck off all the honey, the almonds even taste pretty good. but i for one do not like this flavor. Mind you, I could eat 3095826 honey roasted PEANUTS."
negative,1/7/18,"I would not recommend this oil.  It does not have a pleasant smell and does not purify the skin.  It's just like other oils I have bought from drug stores which were cheaper."
negative,10/8/18,"I guess I'm in the minority, but I really didn't like these much. I was so excited for a cheesecake flavor when I saw it, but these were disappointing. The bars are super sickly sweet with a weird chemically fake vanilla-ish undertaste. Absolutely NO cheesecake or cream cheese type flavor and even the graham layer is just sweet without any real graham cracker taste. The overall texture is slightly gritty and gummy -- not at all creamy. Sizewise they are smallish, but pretty standard for any of the many 100 calorie-ish snack pack foods. Similar in price as most granola and snack bars, none of which are ever much of a good value. Overall, while they aren't inedible or anything, I would not buy these again and I don't even think I'll bother with the rest of the box."
negative,1/7/18,"Ingredients on Deep River Snacks's website are: Potatoes, sunflower oil and/or corn oil, whey, sea salt, onion powder, sugar, garlic powder, torula yeast, dried parsley, maltodextrix, canola oil, soybean oil, rosemary extract and ""natural flavors"".<br /><br />False adversing much?"
negative,10/8/18,"These chips are very spicy to say the least, my tongue burned too much to finish the small individual serving bag. They have an overpowering amount of some Asian spice, perhaps ginger, but it is way too strong and you are left with a very unpleasant taste. I bought 24 of the small size bags but could not bring myself to like the flavor, it all ended up in the trash.  This is definitely a chip that will appeal to only certain palates. I do like the sweet onion flavor of this brand but this Asian flavor was too much of a good thing!"
negative,13/9/18,"The sweet Maui onion tastes like sour cream and onion.  I was hoping to get the delicious chips that I enjoyed in Maui.  Don't wast your time."
negative,17/7/18,"I love salt & vinegar kettle chips so I decided to try these after reading good reviews. When I received them, I noticed from the very first bag that over half of the chips were inedible due to rotten potatoes! I know how kettle chips should look, and I know what normal marks look like on chips. These were rotten. After waiting over a month for a response from the company, I finally found a phone number and called them, only to be told there was nothing they could do. The sad thing is, the chips that were edible were actually flavorful and tasty. Obviously they just don't care about consistent quality, so stay away from these chips!"
negative,16/1/19,"The kettle chip itself is crisp, crunchy and good, although somewhat greasy.  Over coated with the flavoring causing mouth burn when it was not expected in a chip with Rosemary flavoring.  Leaves greasy, gritty residue on fingers after two or three chips."
negative,16/1/18,"I've got to believe these other reviewers haven't actually looked at the list of ingredients that make up these chips. Here they are:<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: SUGAR, PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED PALM KERNEL OIL, COCONUT OIL, LACTOSE, WHEY, NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS (INCLUDING BARLEY PROTEIN), NON-FAT MILK, BUTTERMILK SOLIDS, SODIUM CASEINATE, SOY LECITHIN-AN EMULSIFIER, SALT, ARTIFICIAL COLORS (YELLOW 5 LAKE, YELLOW 6 LAKE, BLUE 2 LAKE)<br /><br />Now I must admit that I didn't look at the label either.  I've been using Nestle's chocolate chips for years, and I thought it was a name I could trust.  Apparently not.<br /><br />So let me tell you how I discovered what the ingredients were.  I was making brownies for the kids for a semi-special occasion so I bought the premium white morsels --thinking they were white chocolate-- and these butterscotch ones.  I dumped them in my batter and noticed when I took the brownies out that the chips didn't seem to have melted.  I didn't think anything of it until I sampled some of the white morsels for a snack.  Very waxy on the tongue.  Not nice like good chocolate would be.  So I tried the butterscotch ones.  Where the heck was the flavor?<br /><br />Well I was shocked when I read the label.  I had no idea that the white chocolate had been reformulated to be Chocolate Free, and I assume that in the past these chips actually had some sort of natural butterscotch element to them, instead of being made of barley protein and artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I mean look at the ingredients; there's more artificial flavors by volume than butter and milk.  And there's a whopping 8 grams of sugar in 1 teaspoon of these things.  Which would be acceptable for cooking sweets if it wasn't for the 4 grams of Trans-Fats laden goo that was also in them.<br /><br />In any case, I've thrown out the rest of these two bags.  If the health concerns weren't bad enough, they don't taste good.  Really sweet more than flavorful, and waxy on the tongue when you eat them au naturel.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/blogger/brownie baker"
negative,16/1/19,"I was wondering how my cookies which were a spin on the America's Test Kitchen perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe could have come out tasting like crud. Well it was the butterscotch chips. I basically took ATK's recipe and adjusted it for oatmeal insead of the chocolate chip by using their base and adding oats, raisins, chopped mac nuts, cinnamon and these chips. It would have been just as amazing as the chocolate chip cookie recipe if I would have ommitted these chips. Now as another reviewer said, the cookies with the chips in it are destined for the trash."
negative,1/8/20,"This lemon salt is ok, but the salt is not infused with the lemon, the lemon is mixed with salt granuals.  So might as well use lemon."
negative,1/7/18,"I bought these cookies after reading all the rave reviews but they were very dry, didn't have much chocolate, and left an unpleasant aftertaste. I don't understand what all the fuss is about. If these were the only GF cookies available, I still wouldn't buy them again."
negative,10/8/18,"These cookies are small, grainy and very crunchy with an awful aftertaste. And very expensive for such a small package of 16 cookies. Might be great for multiple allergies, But I was very disappointed."
negative,15/2/20,"As a mom with Celiac disease with one son that has a tree nut allergy and another that has a soy allergy, I really wanted to like these cookies.  We are used to cooking everything from scratch to ensure the safety of our food.  Wouldn't it be great to have a cookie that my tree nut allergic son and I could grab on the go?  I paid a visit to my local Starbucks to pick up a 1.25 oz. pack of the sugar cookies and excitedly opened the package.  The smell alone was enough to immediately turn me off.  The bag had a synthetic odd smell inside.  I took a bite of the cookie and noted its crunchiness-a good thing about the cookie- but then was overwhelmed by an extremely unpleasant aftertaste.  It almost tasted like burnt popcorn with an artifical butter flavor. A very odd and unpalatable taste indeed. I was so disappointed.  I really liked the story of Dr. Lucy and the idea of the cookie, but most definitely did NOT like the cookie. Although I would classify myself as a bit of a food snob with high standards, I put that aside when reviewing this cookie.  I do not think even the less discerning customer would enjoy this cookie."
negative,22/4/21,"I bought a package of these at Starbucks, and thought good crispy, hmmmm so I bought a case of a mix cinnamon, sugar, chocolate chip and oatmeal.  First they all tasted the same.  They are probably suppose to be crispy but they taste stale, and then they leave an awful aftertaste.  They also taste way to buttery and a portion side is two cookies and the rest are all cracked in the package.<br /><br />There is nothing special about these and are not worth the price, although I love the packaging.<br /><br />Sorry Lucy I've tasted way better GF cookies."
negative,25/9/20,"These are the worst gluten free cookies I have ever tasted.  They were hard, dry and tasted like tapioca flour.  Avoid these at all cost."
negative,16/11/19,"I don't have any dietary restrictions.  I bought these because of an price reduction.  I wouldn't purchase them again.  They have very few chocolate chips.  Like you have to hunt for them in the cookie.  That isn't what chocolate chip cookies should be about.<br /><br />The oatmeal version of these cookies is much better."
negative,9/9/20,"These almonds had an unbelievable amount of salt on them. I love salt but this was over the top. I've bought this brand from other stores and they have never been this salty.  Maybe the machine went wacko when processing these. ???<br />I can't eat these unless I take the time to try and wipe off the salt, which talks forever!!"
negative,1/7/18,"I bought Blue Diamond Natural Chocolate almonds before & 100% Natural almonds it was good but this one made me feel sick i only eat 10 for the day & i dont know if it's the salt or something else with this but i have to throw this away. i cant even move to workout im hoping i can sleep this off. but i guess im the 1 in 1 million that this happens to."
negative,10/8/18,"When in Jamaica I drink JBM coffee and have come to develope a fine appreciation for the bean. What I opened this morning was not what I had expected. To be clear, I was greatly dissapointed. I found bits of husk from the bean, which doesn't make coffee, and is considered filler. The flavor left something to be desired as well, it tasted like folgers coffee without all the acid. I was hoping to leave a great review of this product, but honesty forbids it."
negative,15/1/20,"A co-worker of mine went to Jamaica for vacation in Feb. and bought me a 1lb. bag of the ground.  It's expiration date was March.  I brewed it as soon as I got home.  To me it tasted like cheap coffee that had been left out in the open air for a week.  I wonder if it was due to the expiration date, or does this coffee really taste like this.  If so, I will never buy again.  From all the hype, I was expecting much more."
negative,1/9/20,"I bought the top sirloin hoping to finally get a ""good"" steak at home.<br />The first ones we cooked....could hardly cut with a steak knife.<br />The second time we tried them, I tenderized for quite some time.<br />They were more edible that way, but still nothing better than I could have bought at the local grocery store.<br /><br />Except for the packaging, there is nothing good I can say about these steaks.<br />If you figure the price per pound, these steaks should cut with a butter knife.<br /><br />Will never buy again."
negative,22/7/21,"You get 12 bags for 12.00, in each bag is about a handleful of pretzels. The taste is ok but not worth a dollar a bag.."
negative,1/7/18,"These pretzels have a nice crunch and a lot of nutritional value, but their flavor is very bland.  Bland with a hint of cinnamon.  I wish I'd tried a single bag before buying an entire 12-bag box, but they're not available in stores (at least where I live) and the reviews seemed fairly positive.  On the bright side, they do leave you feeling comfortably full for minimal calories.  A recommended diet food for those who have the fortitude to place higher priority on protein-dense snacking rather than flavor."
negative,10/8/18,"The label on the little bag says 1 serving is 120 calories. But one serving is 1 ounce. The little single serving sized bag is 1.5 ounces! So there are 180 calories in the bag. This is sneaky. No one is going to open their bag and measure out one ounce, then save the other half ounce...<br /><br />EDITED TO ADD:<br />I ordered these again because the price went down momentarily (is now back up) and the product is now changed. Although Amazon still had it listed at 12, 1.5 ounce bags, what I got is 12, 1.2 oz bags. So now yes, one bag is a serving but the nutrition facts do not add up to what was listed before. Now a bag has 120 calories and 15g carbs. Another sneaky move, you get less for the same price."

negative,3/10/21,"This tea is an excellent herbal tea. Love the taste and it's not as weak as most herbal tea is. I used to get it from the Commissary on base but they stopped stocking it so I checked on Amazon. Most wanted to sell by the case but anneeavon sold them in single packages and I swear it said ""and free shipping when ordered from this seller"" above the ""add to cart"" button. I ordered last night and opened my e-mail this afternoon to find they charged me $8.49 shipping for each of the 3 boxes I ordered! And the estimated arrival time is a week away! For that kind of money I'd expect overnight. For that kind of money I could have gotten a couple cases and had change. It's probably my fault for miss reading something but just be aware of the shipping charges on anneeavon products."

negative,30/8/20,"My dogs have been enjoying these treats for years and we've ordered this many times from Amazon in the past.  However, our last order was a big disappointment.  The description of exactly how much of this product you will receive is very unclear, so when I saw that the product weight is 4.2 lbs and the shipping weight is 4.6 lbs., naturally I expected to receive a minimum of three one pound bags (as we have in the past).  Not so.  Amazon outrageously charged us $41.00 for a single one pound bag of dried lamb lungs.  You'd think I was buying caviar!  The treats were promptly packed back up and returned.  Tsk, tsk, tsk, Amazon :(<br /><br />So, 5 stars for the product itself.  0 stars for Amazon this time."

If you don't use the whole 12 pounds right away, the boxes of sugar turn hard as a rock.  Have to microwave them, pound them with a hammer, and then pour the sugar into a plastic envelope with a sugar bear - e.g., <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UKOWFC"">JBK Bear Terra Cotta Brown Sugar Saver</a> - to make it possible to use it.  Definitely not worth it.  Buy it packaged in bags or not at all."

negative,21/10/19,"I went for these, when I got a free 30 bucks to spend with a new Amazon Credit Card, and Im glad I didn't pay full price.<br /><br />I was in the process of creating an authentic Bolognese Meat Sauce, and I wanted some very hearty mushrooms to add a bit of OOMPH to the sauce, which is meat and onion heavy, and I figured from the reviews that these are a meaty tasting mushroom.  I also see the price asked for these at our local Giant Eagle grocery stores, so, yeah, I did get a bargain from their rip off pricing, but, these are basically taking up freezer space.<br /><br />I ordered two grades, a higher grade with bigger shroom pieces, less stems, etc, and in retrospect, should have just ordered the scraps, or even the dust, as I found the big pieces stayed a nasty tough chewy texture, even after hours of cooking, I also extracted just juice from the mushrooms, but the broth wasn't strong enough to bother, I basically just chop these in the food processor, and add a LOT of them to get a change in flavor in recipes, the one ounce bags, don't even bother with, because it takes a lot to get some flavor from them.<br /><br />In all honesty, I have not used another Poricini product, so I can't compare, but, I am disappointed with the results I got from these, it may be they do exactly what they are supposed to, for some one with a very tender palate, but, not for me, and in no case, are these ever going to be rehydrated and served on steak, they just stay too nasty of a product to serve by themselves, strictly good for grinding and using in a recipe."

After brewing, it revealed a bland taste at best.  It was like drinking brewed hay.  I checked the expiration date which is two years from now.  Maybe I had a bad batch but it's going back.  I had a better experience with Rishi Organic Jasmine Pearl Loose Leaf Tea.  I do not recommend this tea to anyone."
negative,2/10/20,"In order for tea to be labeled ""decaff"" is must be under 0.4% caffeine when residue levels are tested.  A tea at 2% caffeine is not decaff.  Non-decaff tea is anywhere between 3-5% caffeine.  So ...  at 2% caffeine, this is a caffeinated tea, with caffeine slightly less than what is naturally present in the tea leaf."

negative,11/10/21,I tried this once and just tossed a whole box in the garbage.  The cereal looks like Cinnamon Toast Crunch but it taste like some sort of fake caramel substitute.  It has a powdery coating that is worse than the butt end of a regular box of cereal with all the broken crumbs in the bottom.  The carmel flavor tastes fake and almost made me gag a few times.
negative,28/9/21,"Fiber one products actually don't have real fiber.  They contain inulin (from chicory root) which is technically fiber because the body can't digest it.  Unfortunately fiber is defined by anything that can't be broken down easily.  These products do not contain REAL fiber. (The real fiber usually found in whole grain breads and bran cereals) So if it says ""chicory root"" or ""inulin"" in the ingredients, you can be sure you aren't eating the fiber your body can actually use.  So if you want lots of sugar and fat without fiber, this product is for you."

negative,13/7/21,"Oberto Cocktail Pep used to be so much better than this. I had been buying them direct from the Oberto online store for many years and I couldn't get enough. No matter what size I ordered they were always excellent.<br /><br />However, in the past few years the quality of their cocktail pep has sure gone down. They used to be very tight and snappy when you would bite into them, the outer casing of each sausage was almost totally smooth because they were packed so tightly, and they had a superior spicy flavor.<br /><br />Nowadays they are all soft and mushy with bland, often stale, flavor. I get the impression that they are cutting corners to save a buck by not stuffing each sausage casing as tightly as they once did. I believe this allows more air to permeate the meat and causes the bad flavor that many people are complaining about.<br /><br />Every year or so I get to craving those old style cocktail pep that I loved so much and I order a package hoping that they will have changed. I keep thinking, maybe I just got a bad batch last time, but every time I am disappointed all over again."

I knew something wasn't right as soon as I opened up the first bag and got a whiff. Then I read the ingredients and was shocked when I saw that they actually use pork hearts as the top ingredient.

negative,4/7/21,"I received this item and there was a tear in the packaging which had caused the dragees to spill all over the inside of the box they arrived in. This isn't very surprising due to the type of plastic it's packaged in -the sort which immediately rips open at the slightest puncture- but as such it should have been packaged for shipping more carefully. Perhaps wrapped it in small bubble wrap and taping it securely as I've seen done with other less fragile items I've ordered. I was especially annoyed however that there is NO way of returning it! That's just outrageous. Very very dissatisfied. I have now tried ordering similar pearl dagrees from Wilton <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002N7ST6U"">Wilton Sugar Pearls, White, 5 Oz</a> which incidentally, are less than half the price.<br /><br />I should say, that generally my experience with Amazon and returns has been excellent.

negative,24/10/21,"I like the idea of getting grains out of cat food, but using peas instead doesn't seem to be the answer.  Carnivores (at least my cat) doesn't tolerate peas.  Vomiting began in about 2-3 weeks and is now instantaneous.  Eat some cat food--go right to throwing up. Both chicken and salmon.  So for me it was a waste of money and very disappointing."

negative,10/7/21,"I had a good experience with other Amazon grocery products and these were a good deal, so I bought a three pack. They weren't horrible but they don't taste the same as the ones you buy in the store. They taste like cheap generic chocolate chip cookies. Which is not necessarily bad, but not what I expected for the price and Chips Ahoy brand.<br /><br />They are cheaper tasting, a little stale and much less chocolate chips. I haven't had store-bought Chips Ahoy for a few months so maybe they changed the formula for all these cookies, but if not, then these seem to be cheap knock-offs made with cheaper ingredients."
negative,4/7/21,"My kids loves Chips Ahoy! and I will have them once in a while as well.  But the kids refuse to eat them from this Family Size package.  Once I tasted them, I knew why.  They have an awful medicinal taste.  Really bad.  I don't what the problem is, but if you like Chips Ahoy, you will not like these.  Go elsewhere."
negative,11/9/21,Product is good; my cats like it.  But the price just keeps climbing.  I will have to train my cats to eat cheaper cat food.

negative,11/6/21,"I have never taken the time to write a review before, but in this case others need to be warned off. I expected to get a product similar to what I have seen in the stores, but this obviously is a replica. The sliders on the bottom of the tray that are supposed to keep the tray straight when you slide it in and out broke off before I even got it out of the package. It is not something you can fix unless you have a solder gun. Even then, it is very ""sticky"" pulling the tray out because there are no rollers. It is metal on metal, which does not work well without some sort of lubrication. I love Amazon, but this product is inferior at best."

negative,18/10/21,"I have tried many flavors of Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookies, and until I tried this one, I liked them all.  The ingredients list mentions that they have a touch of carrot cake spice added..........but it's more than a touch. Unless you really, really love carrot cake, you might want to make a different flavor selection. My favorite is the chocolate chunk cherry but it appears it is only seasonal.....I wish I could get it all year long. The oatmeal raisin is my second favorite. I wish I had ordered them instead of these morning glory."

Instead, tastes just like any one of the other in the line ... dry, stale, dense, oatmeal ""cookie,"" like a cookie experiment gone bad by a pre-teen.<br /><br />In addition, cookies arrived cracked, broken and sticking to bag, yet are dry & stale inside. What a waste. I would have never purchased these in a B&M store had I had an opportunity to examine them first."

negative,11/6/21,"I purchased my 1st order of Miracle Noodle directly from: [...]. I got them for my Mother because she needs to switch to a diet of less carbs and far less calories overall. I purchased the 10 pack of 7oz ""Angel hair"" noodles for $21.99 w/10.89 for shipping for a total of $32.76. A few days later I received the package. I was VERY surprised to find out that each 7oz package of Miracle Noodles ACTUALLY contained OVER 6 3/4 ounces of WATER and LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodles!!! While their marketing material does BARELY mention Water content, they are neither CLEAR nor particularly forthcoming about this fact nor the fact that it accounts for OVER 85% of the purchase product and considering the fact that they instruct you to IMMEDIATELY RINSE the Noodles before use, it's not as if your supposed to prepare the noodle using this WATER! - Well for a couple of reasons (including but not limited to the WATER volume) I decided to return them without opening even 1 package so they were COMPLETELY UNUSED). I was instructed (during a PHONE CALL to their main office) to MAIL THEM BACK  (AT MY EXPENSE) and WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD RECEIVE A FULL REFUND. Well it cost me approx another $10 to ship them back (due to the WATER WEIGHT)and a few days later I received a refund of $21.99. I PAID SHIPPING BOTH WAYS!!! So BASICALLY I PAID $20 in shipping to get a $22 so called REFUND - I PAID $42.00 and GOT BACK ONLY $21.99 !!! This may be legal but it is UNETHICAL and WRONG and when I spoke to the rep on the phone this was never mentioned! Especially for a company that claims to STAND BEHIND IT's PRODUCT 100%!!! When I contacted them by email they informed me that ""THIS IS OUR POLICY"" and cited the requisite schpeal on their website. I was NOT informed of this ON THE PHONE CALL at all! This so-called POLICY should be CHANGED! It may be legal but it's hardly ETHICAL or RIGHT! When is OK to get back ONLY HALF of what you spend when you return a product? IT'S NOT!! Not to MENTION THE FACT that YOU're getting LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodle in a 7 OZ ""Package!!! RIDICULOUS!! Oh and to make matters worse: When I COMMENTED on their Shipping Policy and Water Weight on their FACEBOOK Fan page; instead of addressing the issues OPENLY, HONESTLY and DIRECTLY they IMMEDIATELY and REPEATEDLY DELETED my COMMENTS and then BLOCKED ME from making comments at all! What's that tell you???"

negative,2/8/21,"I honestly don't know how this product could have garnered so many five-star reviews. I bought it for my senior dogs (14 years old) when their usual joint treats (Pet Naturals of Vermont soft chews) were out of stock, since one of my dogs is very finicky about what glucosamine supplements he'll take, and I had tried everything else available without success. I gave both of them the recommended dosage, based on their weights (15 and 24 lbs), and was delighted to see that they happily accepted the treats.  Within 12 hours, though, my Yorkie had raging diarrhea and my Eskie-poo had vomited forcefully, which was very unusual for both of them. Not realizing it was this product, I tried it again a couple of days after nursing them back to health, with the exact same effect. Internet searches confirmed that other users have similarly reported nasty GI side effects with this product."
negative,11/6/21,"My dog loves chicken breast treats. That is, until I bought these. I'm sure this is simply a matter of taste. I don't know if the additives smell different or what's turning him off but he'll pick it up and then just drop it. He refuses to eat them at all."
negative,22/10/21,"I have fed the chicken and duck version of these--though now the reviews regarding china I find disturbing.<br /><br />Regardless, the beef liver version of these are not a hit with my pup and seem to be a very odd, plastic texture.<br /><br />The duck and chicken are both great--but I will be investigating the source of the food."

Follow up:  My dogs vomited after they ate these. 3/09 original warnings from FDA 2007 re: chicken product from China... a follow up was issued by the FDA again on 12/18/08 to remain vigilant and of concern if fed to smaller dogs.<br /><br />Update: DEC 2011 All chicken Jerky remains a problem according to the FDA (product from China noted again to be of concern)<br />Some dogs made ill from chicken jerky product recovered with treatment and others have died.<br />The email from my vet stated that the FDA would like you to report if you have a problem with chicken jerky treats."
negative,17/4/21,"I'm disturbed that these treats, as many reviewers state, are so ""addictive."" My dog, too, loves them but has now begun to shun her meals and will only eat these treats. In trying to make sense of her current state of anorexia, I recently became aware of the FDA advisory on Dec. 19, 2008 stating that one of the symptoms to be aware of in dogs eating chicken jerky treats made in China is ""decreased appetite, although some may continue to consume the treats to the exclusion of other foods."" So be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats.  Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what's happening in China behind the scenes?  Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky?  I and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog's anorexia, except that it coincides with her increased interest (and now ONLY interest) in Happy Hips since I began treating her with them last spring.  Thankfully, her kidney function is still fine, but if you research this on the web, many other dogs were not so lucky and died due to kidney failure.<br />See this link to the FDA website suggesting caution to consumers in using chicken jerky products from China.  Be informed!  [...]"

I subscribe to a couple of Bichon Frise newsgroup and they are saying not to feed these to your dog as they come from China I threw out what I had left for the outside critters in the forest.  I called Dogswell today and they verified that even though they say U.S. on them they are still coming from China."
negative,17/4/21,"Please be aware that although dogs absolutely LOVE these treats, that they may have caused a recent unexplainable illness in our 9 month old Mastiff pup. He was getting 1 or 2 a day of these chicken jerky's for about a week and then suddenly became very lethargic, along with vomiting, diarrhea, and had no appetite ""except"" he would eat only these treats and drink water. Vet thinks he'll recover OK, but advised us to stop feeding them to our dogs. These are still ""Made in China"" and in 2007 reports had shown that dogs were getting sick from these and other brands, and there are still reported cases today. Just be careful and watch your pets closely if you are feeding them these. We will no longer feed these to any of our dogs, ever. Wish Dogswell would manufacturer these in the USA again."
negative,21/1/21,"These chicken strips (and most others like them) are priced so low they are hard to resist. My dogs love them of course and for dogs who tolerate chicken, they should be excellent treats. However, I do not trust pet foods sourced from China. Most of you should remember the melamine disaster of several years ago that killed and permanantly injured over ten thousand pets. It remains almost impossible to determine the conditions under which chinese food products are produced and manufactured. The rumors in the veterinary world (I am a DVM)are that the majority of the chickens used in these cheap products are dead before processing. No one has any clue what, if any, adulterants are added. Many brands are irradiated (if this matters to you). Overall, I recommend purchasing pet food products that the manufacturer guarantees are made 100% from US grown and processed ingredients."
negative,30/1/21,"We have been ordering these chicken jerky treats for a long time with Amazon subscribe and save. My Boston Terriers really love them and get very excited to get their treat every morning. When I opened a bag from my most recent shipment, my dogs refused to take the treat from my hand. They took one sniff and backed away. My son's Lab got very sick from chicken jerky made in China and his vet told him to only buy treats made in the U.S.and I'm going to follow that advice."

If it wasn't for me going into a pet food store that doesn't carry products not made in the USA I would be still feeding this product to my dog. I am really concerned on finding a new product due to my Bichon's allergies, she can only have Lamb. She now sits at the cabinet and cries for her treat. I think I may need to make my own lamb jerkey in my dehydrator. More work but worth it. With no regulations in China who knows what is swept from the floors and put in the product. As we know the packaging is misleading what is misleading in the ingredents. I have been to China it is scary. We take so much for granted in the USA.<br /><br />dp"
negative,6/3/21,"My dogs loved this product and I was happy to spend the money on it, but now that it's made in China- thumbs down, what were they thinking? I'll never buy it again.

negative,8/6/21,"I will no longer be giving these to my dog!! They caused my dog to have diarrhea and vomit! When I did some more research online, there were many many posts about how the treats caused their dogs to have similar and even much more severe health issues! My dog loves these treats. I have been giving these to her for about a year or two now. Every once in a while she would have diarrhea or start vomiting a yellow foamy substance- in most cases both, and I finally now linked it to these treats. Do your research before you buy this product!! However, I would not recommend these at all!"

negative,10/3/21,Admittedly my dog loves these treats and thinks they are delicious.  However they are made in China and dog lovers in the US usually choose not to buy products from China due to prior problems with the quality control that has sickened many animals.  Dogswell should take note of this and manufacture them in the US.  It should also be noted that competitive brands on your grocery store shelves are also made in China even though distributed in California.  The only brand I have found that is manufactured in the US is from Trader Joes.  If you love your dog do not buy this item.  Go to Trader Joes.

No one who loves their pet will buy them, but Amazon will at least give us a fair chance to protect our beloved pets from these poisons imported from China.<br />As a loyal customer, I expect Amazon to protect me and my loved ones from hidden threats. Amazon MUST disclose the country of origin for ALL food products! If Amazon is too ashamed to disclose the source, then Amazon should not sell it!"

Not possible, I spare no expense when it comes to my 3 furry buddy's!  I grabbed the bags of treats and sure enough, MADE IN CHINA.

Ordinarily I would not give my dog anything made in China, but I could not find any duck treats made in the USA. Well, recently I purchased a large package of these at a Pets Warehouse store. I would wake up and find throw up and diarrhea in the house seemingly every time I gave him a duck treat the day before. I didn't want to believe it. I thought perhaps his water bowl was slimy and cleaned it. All was well. I gave him another duck treat a few days later and he got sick again several hours later. Well, I stopped giving him Dogswell Happy Hips Duck treats and he has been fine since then.<br /><br />So, I don't know if it's just a bad batch of treats or if he somehow became sensitive to these treats or if they are contaminated with something. Not going to take any more chances with this brand."

So bad news on the regular jerky, but upside: Dogswell has some USA products too!"
negative,1/6/21,"My dog LOVED these treats.  Then one day, i actually read the packaging and saw these are made in china!  I feel betrayed by this company who pretends they use organic free range chicken, when really those words do not exist in chinese farming practices.  They buy meat from one of the largest makers of dog food in china, a MASSIVE factory.  And are fully aware of the FDA issued warnings about chicken products from China killing pets.  They state they test for everything, but since the contaminant has not been pinpointed yet it is impossible to test for.  Don't give your dog these treats!  Do your research and read every label CLOSELY as they really try and fool you with the fine print."
negative,20/8/21,"I've been buying Dogswell chew treats for my dog for several years. She's always loved them. The most recent time I purchased them, however, she got seriously ill, with heavy vomiting and lethargy. I almost forgot about it, but a few weeks later I found them in the back of the cabinet and tried them again. She got very ill again. Especially since she's rarely sick, it's difficult to ignore the link between these treats and her illness.  Unless and until there's some quality control on these, I highly recommend finding a different treat. As for the issue of 'made in china', I only looked at the packaging more carefully after reading some reviews, and in fact,the packaging clearly states that the product is made in china. I find that pretty incredulous, considering the claims on the packaging about all natural and even free range. Definately beware!"
negative,14/8/21,"I wish I had come to the Amazon site before purchasing this product at my local Wegman's. The 'Product Of China' was printed so small it was easy to overlook. I am a little shocked that Wegman's (a local chain store known for quality) was selling these 'treats' in a big display. The half open package is going in the trash and unopened bag is going back to Wegman's for a refund and a piece of my mind."
negative,21/4/21,"In my opinion, its an outrage that these treats which used to be Made in the US are now Made in China. The company did not advertize anywhere about this and we only found out accidentally while looking at the wrap for ingredients.<br /><br />Let me start my review stating that many of the current 5-star ratings here look suspiciously fake (made up). Its hard to imagine anyone writing something positive about them unless they fail to see reviews clearly warning buyers about these treats being Made in China. Hard to blame Chinese to manufacture them but its Dogwells fault for not realizing dangers of making them there with their poor record in food manufacturing from the past with food poisoning in pet food."
negative,1/4/21,"I had been buying my 2 year old Bichon Frise these Happy Hips Duck Treats for  months until recently when I purchased a large bag that, upon opening it, reeked of some sort of chemical substance which smelled very much like chlorine or bleach. The smell was overwhleming and disgusting. Not knowing what was wrong with it, just out of curiosity I looked on the back of the bag to read the contents and sure enough....at the bottom of the bag were those dreaded words, ""Made in China"".<br /><br />Up until this time I had assumed their treats were made in the USA, and some of them are. But after looking through all their products it seems that their duck and chicken breast treats come from China.<br /><br />Do NOT trust this product!!!"

These are so expensive that I didn't look on the bag to see where they were made until ANOTHER recent recall on Chinese dog treats/food that was killing dogs....when I looked at the Happy Hips bag, I was pretty ticked off to see that these are made in China.<br /><br />I used to joke that my dog was addicted to these, but now I am actually a little concerned that there may be some addictive substance in these Chinese ""treats"""
negative,10/3/21,"I used to get these instore and found a cheaper deal on Amazon. I recently realize when you open the bag, there's a strong smell (like plastic or chemicals).

negative,25/4/21,"I placed an order for Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Beef Liver on 6/25/12.  On July 5 when my current supply was used up, I opened the new batch.  Started with one pouch and then a second pouch.  For the first time the product doesn't appear to be healthy and fresh.  Instead of being solid brown, hard and crispy, the beef liver pieces are soft, pliable and some have a whitish powdery covering on them.  I'm afraid to feed these to  my dogs or other dogs that I meet in the park.  I've been buying this product for years and this is the first time it doesn't look and feel right.  I'm going to try to get an exchange hoping that this is just a bad batch.  One thing I did notice when the package arrived and that is the long, tall plastic bag was substituted with a horizontal short bag that didn't fit the 6 pouches very well.  My guess is that another manufacturer is making this dog treat, not the original one and that's the reason for the inferior and unhealthy quality of the treats."

I purchased several bags (strips, wrapped apples, etc) and now realize the country of origin is CHINA.  With all the FDA regulations about packaging, it's about time it was mandated that country of origin be prominently displayed (like in 20 font type - not microscopic writing no one notices!!!) ON THE FRONT OF THE PACKAGE!!!  As a result, I will no longer purchase Dogswell products.  As an aside, rawhide is an even worse offender, since the dog can get a much higher dose of any toxins used in curing the hide (and you can bet there are plenty!).  I even picked up a package of a brand named (something like) ""U.S.A. Rawhide"" and on the back, in fine print, was ""Made in China.""  Why aren't our legislators doing something productive and cracking down on this?  It's sneaky at best and intentionally deceptive at worst!  Amazon, please find us products for our ""furry kids"" that won't make them sick or kill them!"
negative,30/6/21,"My dog used to LOVE these.  I thought I was was giving him a great ""treat"", that was actually a supplement to improve his arthritis symptoms.  Then, his liver enzymes were elevated, and he was becoming less active, and always thirsty.  Thank goodness a friend sent me a link about the FDA warnings, 2-3 since, 2009!<br />Hundreds of dogs have died,very painful and expensive deaths.  If you love your dog-go to the FDA  website yourself...and Do Not BUY these ""treats""!"
negative,1/3/21,"My otherwise healthy Papillon was doing great before feeding these to him.  He is normally pretty fussy about which treats he likes, so when I found these I thought I had hit a gold mine.  However, over time, I saw behavior changes (a normally laid back dog getting first hyper, then lethargic).  I took him to the vet and they saw that his liver and kidneys were being compromised in his lab work.  That's when I started looking into everything he was eating, and noticed that these are made in China.  I did not check for this initially because I purchased them at Whole Foods, and WF has guidelines before a food can get on the shelves.  I am concerned that while these treats may not have caused death, they are having an adverse effect on some pets.<br /><br />Three weeks after I took him off these this food, his lab values returned to normal.<br /><br />I noticed several other reviews here from pet owners with similar issues to mine.  I am giving them 1 star, because there is no button for 0 stars."
negative,29/1/21,"Okay, a lot of chicken breast treats from China are causing dogs to be sick (see the FDA website for details).  This is not one of them, but when I started buying it, it was made in the USA.  Now it's made in China.  Although my dogs have long loved this treat, I'm in the process of searching for a replacement made in a safe country."
negative,17/4/21,"I have been feeding these to our dog for years to help her with her joints, especially her hips. Ever since I started her on these as a treat, meaning I gave her one in the morning and another in the evening she regained her active self and they helped her get interested in her regular meals. It was a win, win situation for our finicky eater.<br /><br />However, I would like to note, that when I started her on these treats, they were being made in the USA. Resentfully I discovered that they are now produced in China. As we know, China produces some very high end products and some real crap as well. However, when it comes to food products that come from overseas a warning flag goes up in my mind, especially if they are coming from China. Personally I never noticed anything odd with our 14 year old dog's reaction to Happy Hips. Still, I decided that I did not want to subject her to a food product coming out of China.<br /><br />Does anyone know of another product like Happy Hips with Glucosamine (for the joints) in it, that is produced in the USA?"
negative,10/3/21,"Plenty of articles have been written about the danger and disease's caused by Chinese made dog treats.  These treats are made in China.  Plenty of healthy USA made treats available.  Avoid these at all costs!!!  After the latest information was released, I tried to return to Amazon, but they said no.  Please do not buy these ""treats""."
negative,30/5/21,"My dog became very ill (vomiting, diarrhea, excruciating pain) in mid-Oct and spent three days at the Emergency Vet - and cost us $3500! They ruled out a bunch of things and were only able to say that he might have Irritable Bowel Disease but the biopsy to find out for certain would cost us an additional $1800. He did recover (without the test) and came home and is on a special gastrointestinal diet now. However, I have to say that I had a large bag of these in my cupboard when he became ill and used them regularly as the treat of choice to get him in his crate. I can't say for sure that these were the cause but I won't be buying ANY dog food products (treats or otherwise) that are made in China. Treats made in the USA only for us!!"

I am asking Amazon for a refund - otherwise, they are going in the trash unused.<br /><br />Copied from FDA web site.<br /><br />FDA Continues to Caution Dog Owners About Chicken Jerky Products<br />November 18, 2011<br /><br />The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is again cautioning consumers that chicken jerky products for dogs (also sold as chicken tenders, strips or treats) may be associated with illness in dogs. In the last 12 months, FDA has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from China. These complaints have been reported to FDA by dog owners and veterinarians.<br /><br />FDA issued a cautionary warning regarding chicken jerky products to consumers in September 2007 and a Preliminary Animal Health Notification in December of 2008. After seeing the number of complaints received drop off during the latter part of 2009 and most of 2010, the FDA is once again seeing the number of complaints rise to the levels of concern that prompted release of our earlier warnings.<br /><br />Chicken jerky products should not be substituted for a balanced diet and are intended to be fed occasionally in small quantities.<br /><br />FDA is advising consumers who choose to feed their dogs chicken jerky products to watch their dogs closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products: decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination. If the dog shows any of these signs, stop feeding the chicken jerky product. Owners should consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than 24 hours. Blood tests may indicate kidney failure (increased urea nitrogen and creatinine). Urine tests may indicate Fanconi syndrome (increased glucose). Although most dogs appear to recover, some reports to the FDA have involved dogs that have died.<br /><br />FDA, in addition to several animal health diagnostic laboratories in the U.S., is working to determine why these products are associated with illness in dogs. FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Response Network (VLRN) is now available to support these animal health diagnostic laboratories. To date, scientists have not been able to determine a definitive cause for the reported illnesses. FDA continues extensive chemical and microbial testing but has not identified a contaminant.<br /><br />The FDA continues to actively investigate the problem and its origin. Many of the illnesses reported may be the result of causes other than eating chicken jerky. Veterinarians and consumers alike should report cases of animal illness associated with pet foods to the FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator in their state or go to [...]"
negative,6/5/21,"Just a word of warning...This product is made in China where they may add a substance that can cause serious kidney problems in dogs. Read the blog on the topic of chicken dog treats made in China - [...]. After reading the many comments posted by dog owners who fed they dogs chicken treats made in China, I am discarding all of these treats and will seek an alternative product that is made in the USA."
negative,20/4/21,"FDA just issued yet another warning for dog chicken jerky treats made in CHINA..... dog lovers, you NEED TO PAY ATTENTION!!!! We just threw our stuff in the trash......Yet another health article appeared on CNN online re: dog chicken jerky treats. I re-read the reviews on Amazon. I contacted Dogswell customer service and got a lengthy, very informative reply that said, "" A large number of our products are sourced and manufactured in the United States and only a small number of our treats, are made in China."" (My package clearly states made in CHINA --- so, did I buy that ""small number"" of bags??). I carefully weighed all the information and still do not feel comfortable. I believe the manufacturer cares a lot about dogs but how about keeping the business right here in the USA?<br /><br />We just made the decision to stop ordering this product. Yes, my dogs like the treats but I cannot, in my heart, say I can serve them to my pups. I am unconvinced that this is the best option for my dogs."
negative,20/4/21,"I don't trust dog treats made in China.  As an alternative, there's a good chicken jerky dog treat made by Goodness Gracious - in the USA and using 100% human grade chicken.  [...]"
negative,21/4/21,I have been giving these chews to my Mini-Pincher and Mini-Dauchand for the past 3 years to help support their joints and hips.  The last batch I bought is darker in color to the point of almost being burnt and smells a lot more.  It made my Mini-Pincher sick to the point of vomiting and liquid stools.  I am going to shop for a better product that is made here in the US . . . I have been looking at GNC products for Dogs and that is probably the route I will take.
negative,2/5/21,I bought these from a large chain pet store. after reading the reviews I checked the bag... made in China. I threw the whole bag away. I wish I would have read the reviews first!
negative,18/12/19,"Good thing I got this from the bargain bin or I would really be perturbed. Whatever the claims, this mix has no chocolate flavor of any kind. A more correct description would be Coconut flavored drink mix. Apparently the 10 oz rating is including the weight of the ""cauldron"" because there's no way there was 10 oz of product inside. You might get three cups of ""hot chocolate"" per container if you like the ""flavor"" really mild.<br />It really wasn't worth the price I paid and certainly not the inflated regular price. Two of the three cauldrons were dented heavily so those won't even be much use as decoration. Look for a better brand."
negative,19/1/20,"This is one of my favorite cereals. But purchase it only if you don't mind eating it in powder form. What you get is mostly powder, not crunchy squares. I will not be ordering again, sorry."
negative,19/1/20,"While taste is OK it's simply using too many artificial colors (blue1, red 40, yellow 5, yellow 6 - approved by FDA doesn't mean it's healthy) and other chemicals (BHT etc) to be used by children.<br />If you're going to eat it yourself - take your chances. But since there are many good and healthy alternatives - why bother?"
negative,31/3/20,"I was disappointed to receive Earth's Best Organic Snakin' Fruit Rings Banana because it hurt my child when she bit into the hard and stale treat."
negative,18/12/19,"We ordered the product and received 2 broken bottles, but Amazon is excellent and reshipped the entire order again one day shipping.  Unfortunately, even at 85 cents a bottle, we overpaid.  There is NO cheese taste and it is really just a salty mess.  Now we have 10 bottles of a below average product.  Save your money."
negative,13/10/19,Absolutely NO cheese flavor at all. All you can taste is salt salt salt. Save your money and try something else.
negative,28/9/20,"If you like cheese seasoning on your popcorn, this product will not deliver.  It tastes like they should instead of putting anything cheese related on the label they should say, 'improved salt flavoring that will stick to popcorn more than salt'.  I would recommend anything by Kernal Season's brand... that tastes like cheese.  But if you like a salty tasting popcorn, this is the seasoning for you..."
negative,16/11/20,I bought this at a local Albertsons recently and it is not at all as advertised.  There is no cheesy flavor detectable in the product.  Even the salt flavor is off.  Avoid this product.
negative,27/2/20,Reese changed their Cheesy Popcorn Seasoning.  It is more salt than cheese.  In fact it has very little cheese flavor left.  I will not be purchasing this product again.
negative,26/2/21,"This is an okay gift box, only if you like mediocre cheese and summer sausage. The items are small, smaller than they appear in the picture. I only paid $30, but I would not purchase it again. On the positive side, the mustard samples that come with it make the items edible."
negative,18/12/19,"It looks llike I just walked into a raw deal. The item is intolerably stale, and there is no recourse - I am simply stuck with it!<br />I love licorice, and have bought Gustaf's licorice on Amazon before, to much enjoyment. What I received here is a junky plastic bag unsuitable to preserve the product, containing product that clearly is too old and has not been kept under proper storage conditions.<br /><br />Add to that, labeling is generic, and apparently this item contains wheat in substantial quantities, not what I know from my brand name Gustaf's licorice packages.  Those disclaimers on the item descriptions regarding ingredients may differ are utterly pointless and plain not ok. How does that do anything other than cover the vendor's rear? Clearly, customers get no choice, and might wind up with expensive purchases of allergy triggers.<br /><br />Strike one - utterly stale<br />Strike two - not returnable<br />Strike three - no declaration of ingredients pre-purchase, only offensive legal CYA<br /><br />[Just about every packaged food or supplement I can purchase in a store falls under clear FDA guidelines for labeling, food safety (storage conditions, materials, expiration date) - those rules are growing on me!]<br /><br />I am a strong buyer, and I shall refrain from any such purchases moving forward. Not only is it too risky and pricey if duped with degraded product, it is also an inexcusable trap  - who wants to get stuck with waste and have their  money taken?!<br />Amazon is not what I'd remembered it to be!"
negative,19/1/20,Thank god that i tasted the metal before i swallowed them. I dont even get how it got mixed up with this. The candy itself is sex in mouth.
negative,13/9/20,"This product was very good when I began buying it but lately it is terrible. There is no taste at all. That's the reason I no longer purchase this item. Thank you."
negative,10/7/20,"Once again, Paragon has disappointed with this flavor. The Hawaiian Tropic, simply did not carry much flavor, and what you could taste was not pleasant at all. I do not recommend this syrup concentrate."
