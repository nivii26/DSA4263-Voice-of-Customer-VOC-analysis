negative,10/3/21,something to eat if you re starving but please give real food to hungry people what s in kellogg s corn flakes milled corn sugar malt flavoring high fructose corn syrup salt yes of course it also has lots of yummy preservatives such as bht and a few synthetic vitamins and iron in minute quantities for nutrition you get basically carbs from lots of sugar and almost no protein add skim milk or you ll get saturated fat with a little protein from whole milk for added nutrition include a sliced banana and a capful of wheat germ if you like corn flakes that is your business and you should enjoy them but this is not health food and it is a very poor value for more than cents an ounce per package at this price the inner package s failure to maintain freshness is an even bigger drawback when one thinks of how long it may take to finish ounces of this stuff why not use a vacuum sealed container like kretschmer s wheat germ to preserve freshness after all it s in the same price range so if you are hungry you are really eating the wrong stuff something to eat if you are starving but please give real food to other hungry people please
negative,25/4/21,i ordered a flat of food they were on sale that contained chicken apple compote dinner it contained of this variety and he liked the first one but the others although properly sealed were solid and moldy and stinky one of the turkey dinners in the flat was also improperly sealed the lid popped we were lucky because i just happened to check that one now i m so paranoid that i check all of them several times i called earth s best and they assured me that they haven t had this problem before and that i shouldn t worry about it i m so suprised that this got passed qa qc inspection at a baby food manufacturer why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety we also recently opened other jars in this flat after my son refused to eat them and realized that they were rotten of them were completely solid and domed at the top we poked a toothpick down to the bottom of the jar and it was dry throughout shortly after eating his last dinner of this box my son started vomiting and refused to eat we have contacted the usda about this if this happens to you please same your jars so you can give them the information they need it may prevent other babies from getting sick i ll never buy anything from earth s best again
negative,28/9/21,unlike another product i reviewed for vine at least this product does not have sugar per se in it it is carbonated water added to a concentrate mixture of in this order apple grape tangerine and last as well as least acai concentrate the first two on the list apple and grape are two of the most common fruit sweeteners used in beverages etc that is why the product tastes sweetened it has calories quite a lot for oz of flavored carbonated water and all of it is from carbohydrates grams and over of the carbs grams are sugars apple and grapes have some of the highest concentrations of fructose a fruit sugar that not only commonly appears in commercial beverages because it is sweeter than regular cane sugar and thus it is cheaper to use but it is also known to because diarrhea particularly in children so another drink on the hit parade of pretend healthy drinks appealing to the masses concern for their ever growing girth and deluding them that this will help forestall continued growth you are better off drinking diet coke you would be even more better off buying the sparkling flavored waters with no calories my favorite is bella familglia in pomegranate lime lemon and orange flavors and is sold from time to time on amazon as well as your local supermarket better yet buy some organic pure fruit juice such as pomegranate and pour cup in a glass of your favorite sparking water or a quarter cup in a oz bottle of your favorite sparkling water at least it is the actual juice and not some fructose extract
negative,25/5/21,give me better ingredients kind larabars for more or sweeter items genuine junk for less not sure i d invest in a single bar again let alone this size
negative,3/6/21,do not fed your dog any happy hip dogswell product it is not safe google it if your dog has eaten them regularly have the vet do blood work
negative,21/1/21,i love eating them and they are good for watching tv and looking at movies it is not too sweet i like to transfer them to a zip lock baggie so they stay fresh so i can take my time eating them
negative,6/3/21,i purchased the mango flavor and to me it doesn t take like mango at all there is no hint of sweetness and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice i ve been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades so i m familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products i ve tried the mango flavor is one of the least appealing i ve tasted it s not terrible but it s bad enough that i notice the bad taste every sip i take
negative,17/4/21,seriously this product was as tasteless as they come there are much better tasting products out there but at calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack you just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor
negative,1/6/21,terrible artificial lemon taste like pledge lemon furniture polish don t do this to yourself just use plain flake salt and some fresh grated lemon zest
negative,20/8/21,the taste of these white cheddar flat breads is like a regular cracker which is not bad except that i bought them because i wanted a cheese taste what was a huge disappointment how misleading the packaging of the box is the photo on the box i bought these in store makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads expanding the length and width of the box wrong the plastic tray that holds the crackers is about smaller all around leaving you with about or so small flatbreads what is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and eco friendly packaging fail they used a huge box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers not ecofriendly at all would i buy these again no i feel ripped off the other crackers like sesame tarragon give you a little more bang for your buck and have more flavor
negative,1/4/21,i paid for a ounce pkg of these at lunch today i bought them because brown rice is a good carb as soon as i tasted one and it tasted like a corn chip i checked the ingredients the name is deceptive these have masa corn flour listed in the ingredients and it overwhelms the taste i won t buy these again i can get sunchips for less money and similar taste
negative,2/5/21,i once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy i discovered them when i was in england back in and quickly became a fan about a year ago i picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket i was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it after opening the bag i found the chips were not even close to the kettle chips i was used to they were all uniform whitish yellow in color flavor was way off the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and i was very disappointed so i e mailed kettle with the following what happened i bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste it tastes cheaper i don t know how else to put it i also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as i did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor i am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product did i just get a weird batch i have been buying only kettle chips for about years now so i am wondering i did receive a reply thanks for letting us know about your experience with your kettle brand chips it sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections and we apologize our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color but our chips should still taste great thanks for providing us with the best before code from the bag this really helps when passing on your comments to our staff we are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our kettle brand flavors or nut butters believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase in case you buy this product again we suggest avoiding the same best before date if you still have it in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within weeks please let me know if i can be of any more help well the next bag was good since that time i have picked up bags of chips all were like the bad bag so i am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost i did some research and found out that kettle was bought out by a private equity company so the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at kettle acquire company with high quality brand recognition sell product to mass merchants lower quality cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand stay away from kettle chips they are no longer the same
negative,18/12/19,i purchased this because i read that it was a natural cure for hives um how about not it did nothing for my hives and it tastes awful luckily a co worker of mine loves this stuff reminds him of his grandmother and i gave it to him yucky yucky stuff
negative,13/9/20,we have ordered uncle rays bbq chips many times before always been pleased except this order just not the same seasoning as usual generally lacked much for taste not sure if they have reduced the seasoning in their processing but out of case we bought we have opened and thrown away bags already very disappointed with this order
negative,10/7/20,i have loved ketchup flavored potato chips since i was a kid and spent my summers at my grandparents in canada this is a very popular flavor there and seems to be always available i recently got back from a trip to montreal where i ate at least a pack a day i decided i really wanted some around and was happy when i found these on amazon unfortunately the flavor is nowhere close to the brands i ve tried before there s a sort of smoky barbeque sauce thing going on not that they re as good as bbq potato chips which i love they just don t taste like ketchup i tried to get through a bag over a couple of weeks to see if they would grow on me then just threw them all out yuck
negative,22/5/21,i bought this for my husband since he loves ranch he uses ranch dressing with everything before i bought it i read a review that said it taste good inspite of the fat free well my husband had it and says it s aweful i guess to each his own everyone s tastebuds are not alike someone else may like it so i am not going to discourage anyone from trying it however i had to cancel my subscription because the only one that likes ranch in the family doesn t like this one i guess he needs the fat
negative,18/12/19,this stuff sounded perfect way too much red dye and no taste according to me and my friends who tried it kind of salty basically i would stay away from it i am tempted to toss it out but paid too much to feel right about it
negative,9/7/21,i tried these as i love thai food ginger and coconut that was my problem as this mess does not even vaguely resemble thai food and has no discernible ginger or coconut taste plus the noodles stick together even when prepared as suggested and come out in a big clump when you try to eat them also the nutrition label is misleading i am dieting and read labels very carefully this says a serving is one cup and also says one package weighs oz half a cup i figured as it did not say otherwise and as this type of meal is usually one serving that after adding water there would be one serving per package not so one package is actually two servings or over calories this is far more than any other pre packaged noodle meal i have seen the excessive calorie content might have been ok had the product tasted good but it doesn t i would definitely recommend you stay away from this mess
negative,29/9/21,i ve heard about these chips for a while now and thought they would be a good alternative to regular chips i couldn t eat them though they just don t taste good to me personally my grandmother loved them though and i gave the rest to her
negative,5/6/21,i love amazon and i love the reviews from people i ve been introduced to alot of great products b c of the reviews but this time total complete let down popchips having stars is just down right perplexing the should not get more than a but generally i sorta want to give it a but the packaging is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing so i through in the extra point i ordered these thinking that d they d be maybe a slightly better version of baked lays man was i wrong i ve tried most of the baked lays flavors my go to s at first were original baked lays and sour cream baked lays since those are my favorite regular lays but then i discovered bbq baked lays and seriously those are fantastically great bbq baked lays are packed with so much flavor these popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips literally they do because they aren t as good as baked lays i can definitely see eating much less of them which could be a benefit but i say just use portion control and zip lock bag a bunch of baked lays i m trying to think of ways to go into more detail but there s really not much more i can say summary how do popchips taste like slightly burnt air chips it s sort of a weird taste takes alot of getting used to would i suggest buying them no if you re eager to try them i say buy a bag from your local grocery store a week or so after i ordered these on here i saw them at m local krogers so they re definitely expanding nutrition information bag oz g calories total fat g sodium mg total carbohydrate g dietary fiber g sugar g protein g vitamin a vitamin c calcium and iron if you buy a big bag of bbq popchips and big bag of bbq baked lays here are the nutrition information side by side pop chips serving size oz g about chips calories total fat g sodium mg total carbohydrate g dietary fiber g sugars g protein g baked lays serving size oz g about chips calories total fat g sodium mg potassium mg total carbohydrate g dietary fiber g sugars g protein g vitamin c calcium so these two are very close but baked lays wins because it virtually has not sodium since potassium mg offsets the sodium mg leaving g of potassium plus there s more fiber and more vitamin c and most importantly they taste better i for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that baked lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit at the end of the day make a decision for yourself but i d strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both baked lays and popchips i can almost guarantee you that baked lays will win hands down hopefully amazon starts selling well priced variety single serve bags of baked lays soon for now i found one from a seller but the price seems a little high but there are bags instead of smart mix variety pack count baked lay s classic baked cheetos baked ruffles baked doritos nachos cheese rold gold tiny twists pack of
negative,9/7/21,these chips taste average and they are insanely expensive compare to the big bags of chips from safeway or costco for you can get a big bag with times the amount of chips compare to these oz bag chips so for in safeway you can get worth of popchips these bags are so tiny it s like serve size for fat people trying to lose weigh or something for me i never gain weigh i rather go buy big bag of chips these are expensive ripoff chips will never buy again maybe i think the price is high because i bought it from amazon com maybe elsewhere is cheaper but chips as junk food shouldn t be that expensive compare to local stores
negative,9/7/21,this product was a complete disappointment tastes like mushy pineapple there was no papaya taste
negative,10/11/19,this expensive pancake mix tastes so processed and fake a less expensive bisquick from your local grocery store beats the taste no doubt it s a yucky product
negative,1/3/20,we didn t care for this product at all it seemed to have a funny after taste to it wasn t worth the cost we were unable to even finish using what we purchased it was that nasty
negative,29/8/19,holy cow i have never seen this much grease in a boxed product like this also it has enough salt to kill an entire family of slugs use it in your garden don t eat it
negative,14/10/21,i purchased this item to celebrate the birth of my grandson i should have opted for real cigars they might have tasted better these cigars were very hard and hurt my teeth to chew not to mention that these gum cigars were much too sweet
negative,9/5/20,i m usually into pineapple and coconut drinks but this drink just didn t taste all that great to me the taste doesn t resemble anything close to a pina colada flavor and it was actually difficult to taste the pineapple or coconut in it it just tastes tangy and a little sour like water that has a bit of sugar and sour ness to it yeah not really a taste i crave i m not sure if everyone had this reaction to this drink but it just didn t appeal to me i really wanted to like it though because as i said before i usually love pineapple coconut drinks
negative,7/3/20,the taste is good but i found myself biting down on small bits of lobster shells more often than acceptable this made me not want to finish my bowl of soup
negative,4/8/20,this is one of the worse tasting soups i ve ever eaten i hated it and now i have a full case it tastes bitter to me and my husband wouldn t even try it only my cat was trying to reach it on the counter
negative,26/12/19,given the recent issues with products made in china i have decided to not buy any food products from there so i won t be buying anymore of this snack if they ever switch to made in the you s i ll buy it again as i did like it
negative,25/4/21,i used to buy these as healthy snacks at my office cafeteria and consider it better than a bag of potato chips these taste very crunchy and tasty given the kind of unethical food stories we read about china we need to see some kind of assurance and facts on the processes that the manufacturer is following to make these you just cannot import food stuff and sell in the us as gourmet snack food there needs to be data backing this few example of chinese food yuk melamine kind of platic in baby food and milk so wide spread that of milk in china contained this plastic in honey contaminated with ciprofloxacin antibiotic because of which it was banned in the us soy sauce made from human hair not joking google it if you want spurious drugs exported to african countries need some good facts and quality controls from the manufacturers that the chinese producers are complying with some good quality controls
negative,9/3/18,chips ahoy cookies were not very tasty my children and husband would not eat them i tried to give them away and everyone refused
negative,18/5/18,sent this as a gift and found out later that many items were stale they loved the thought though and loved the way it looked
negative,20/2/18,my local walmart and target both have this ground or whole bean at a regular price of less than per oz bag it s way overpriced here it is an excellent coffee i m drinking it as i write this an interesting hint of woody creamy citrusy taste that s dark but without the burnt aftertaste that comes with many dark roasts
negative,9/3/18,this coffee tastes so nasty i can t even drink it it s disgusting i can t believe anything this bitter is acid free i actually threw away two bags
negative,23/2/18,i have to admit based on most of the reviews i was sold on getting the pack was a mistake all three flavors had a distinct taste of the sucralose that is the name of the artificial sweetner in the product if you like splenda you may like this but it has a distinct taste unfortunately not for me a few friends of mine that tried it and said it wasn t bad unfortunately that was the best of the comments if you really want a good cup of hot chocolate try cafe escapes or swiss miss both are twice as good in my opinion liked the escapes best wish i liked the artificial sweetner but the that taste has a distinct after taste probably would be better without the artificial stuff and more regular sugar if your going to order i would get the small pack to try it better then throwing out try cafe escapes and swiss miss and see for yourself
negative,9/3/18,i was hoping this was a good idea however we tried them even after i heard they tasted bitter like artificial sweetner and it was true not the same as the stuff from the can
negative,3/4/20,this tastes like it has artificial sweetener in it and doesn t taste very chocolatey the name brand cocoa kkups are better or just dumping a regular cocoa packet in a cup and running the water through into it is better
negative,18/5/18,i looked forward to a delicious hot cocoa but was very disappointed with the flavor it has an awful aftertaste like the taste you get after drinking a bad diet soda also kind of weak even on the smallest cup setting
negative,27/1/19,i bought this for my daughter and grandson they both tried it at different times and they both said it had a funny taste and did not drink it therefore i will not buy it again
negative,8/5/20,i just got a keurig a few weeks ago and wanted to get some hot chocolate for it as an alternative to coffee i didn t have super high expectations but these are absolutely awful there is a very strong plastic chemical taste to these k cups i tried all of them and tried putting some milk in them to help mask the chemical taste and nothing will help the only reason i gave these k cups stars is because my boyfriend can tolerate them but i don t trust him because he ll eat just about anything in his opinion they are not that good but he will still drink the mug from what i ve read of other hot chocolate k cups you d be better off just buying a regular mix and doing it that way
negative,9/3/18,i ordered this product because of a good price deal amazon shipped accordingly absolutely no problems there however the taste of this product was horrendous it tasted as if someone through chemicals in a cup and told me to brew it i personally will go back to buying swiss miss in a can and just using the keurig to give me hot water cheaper and much better tasting
negative,18/5/18,i ordered this specifically b c they said dark chocolate so i was hoping for a rich chocolate flavor they taste very watery even using the lowest amount of water on the keurig the nutritional fact show that it only has grams of sugar where the normal store bought powder has grams i didn t like these at all if you re going for something low sugar they might be for you
negative,17/5/20,nice price and glad to see a subscribe save option on k cups however this was undrinkable in our opinion didn t seem to be too watery like another reviewer said just a bad off taste
negative,3/5/19,taste nothing like how cocoa should taste i ll never touch this again i ll be trying the swiss miss cocoa maybe better luck
negative,31/12/20,there is a taste of sugar substitute the aftertaste turns me off i ve even tried using a little bit of milk in the mug before hand to hide the taste it didn t so i m just using swiss miss powder and a little milk to make it a creamier hot chocolate before using using my keurig
negative,13/1/20,i enjoyed these k cups when i used them they tasted pretty good however i quickly noticed that my keurig brewer began to have problems after i started using these and other grove square k cups even when i would brew other cups i would get half brewed cups of coffee smaller cups and other issues i cleaned the brewer following all the instructions and tips in the manual the issues came up again as soon as i used these k cups what i discovered is that the grove square k cups were gunking up my brewer badly i had to clean out every part of the brewer completely including the brewer basket area the water reservoir and the internal mechanism after completing the entire cleaning process two more times my brewer got back to normal i won t order any grove square products again
negative,21/9/20,this hot chocolate tastes like hot sugar water with a pinch of coco in it although even the sugary taste is weak and tainted by the flavor of the artificial sweetener sucralose the consistency is watery and bland this is when i made the oz cup as directed by the directions on the box i do not recommend this product
negative,14/7/21,i really wanted these to taste good but there is something in there that is very bitter i had to add too much sugar to make them even slightly palatable no one would eat them they looked delicious after baking and they re healthy but that s only if you manage to choke one down i have tried their gingerbread corn muffin mix and jalapeno cornbread mix and those are all great
negative,2/12/20,i bought these graham sticks based on their excellent reviews and having purchased earth s best organic vanilla cookies had high hopes for a healthy snack to serve my kids needless to say i should have purchased one box at the grocery store first before committing to boxes through amazon which you are unable to return even unopened boxes since this is a food item the crackers smelled strange even before tasting them my year old turned up her nose and refused to eat them anymore after trying a few i wish i could describe the taste but it would be really hard it may sound strange for an organic food but it was almost like a faint chemical smell at best i can say that they weren t anything like a regular graham cracker flavor even as an organic option they should have a better taste my year old did eat some of them without complaint so i am hoping she will tolerate them through boxes so i feel like i did not waste my money good price but definitely test one box first to see if you like them
negative,1/3/21,these cups are artifically sweetened with sucralose i didn t realize until i tried one and ended up with a little bit of a headache which made me check the ingredient list it isn t noted on the front of the box they definitely have an artificial taste i would not buy them again
negative,18/8/21,this is the first time we bought this tea from amazon we used to get it directly from revolution tea i don t know if that made any difference or if it was just a change in the tea s composition along with the packaging but what used to be my wife s favorite tea now has a metallic smell and aftertaste with much less of a pomegranate flavor and now a strong almost cheap generic green tea flavor really disappointing especially since we re stuck with six boxes
negative,31/7/21,i ve been paleo for six months as has my partner we both found these inedible all four kinds which by the way taste nearly the same i m not sure what it is about them either it seems like they would be good from the ingredients but something about the combination of flavors just does not taste good i kept trying them again hoping that they would grow on me they sure didn t we finally tossed them so i would advise getting just one from a local co op or something before you buy a whole bunch online i sure which i had
negative,13/6/20,these are very tasty but way too sweet sugary i felt like i was eating candy instead of meat if that s okay with you then you ll probably love these but i was looking for something a bit healthier yes i know it says sweet in the product name but i bought it because of the no hormone no antibiotic no artificial ingredient aspect
negative,15/1/21,my baby didn t seem into these dinners so i tried them they re not terrible but not good either we ll stick with the eb fruits and veggies until she s ready for table foods
negative,14/1/21,maybe it s just me but i have used this extract in my oatmeal same amount as mccormick extracts and i can t taste any flavor at all very disappointing
negative,6/6/21,i believe gerber may have mixed apricots with the peaches it now has a sour after taste and my son hates it
negative,21/7/20,they have some textured powder stuff on them that makes them taste bad bad after taste i guess it s so they don t stick together never again
negative,5/1/21,i do not like the taste of this at all i have some other fennel tea from another company not on amazon and it is fantastic cannot remember exact name but think it is something like mb is a french company and i got it in canada and by mail order after that it is much better to my taste never dreamed there would be this much variance among fennel seeds as only ingredient
negative,1/1/21,i have a tried a few of these wasa crisp breads this one was by far the worst it was in essence entirely flavorless it tasted to me the way that i expect that those little packing styrofoam peanuts would taste don t get me wrong it didn t taste bad hence the stars it just didn t taste like anything looking for a low cal snack type cracker try the wasa sourdough rye crackers now those are heavenly
negative,18/6/21,i purchased this coffee to make iced coffee drinks it has very little coffee taste and the dark chocolate taste is more chemical than chocolate similar to the taste of flavoring used in baking i will not be purchasing this coffee again my suggestion to those considering a purchase buy something else
negative,18/6/21,i have a one one coffee pod machine and have ordered pods online before these looked good and sounded like high quality coffee albeit a little pricey for pods this was the worst cup of coffee i have ever tasted it left a bitter taste in my mouth that lingered for hours yuck don t be fooled by the fancy name and packaging it tastes like rocket fuel fortunately amazon refunded my money when i explained how bad it was throwing the whole box away
negative,18/6/21,having liked the various types of ghirardelli chocolate and premium hot cocoa s i decided to try some ghirardelli chocolate premium hot cocoa mix chocolate mocha after trying several cups of this i started to wonder what happened to the ghirardelli chocolate as myself i thought it was overpowered with the coffee taste not my cup of hot cocoa
negative,27/6/21,it tastes like jack links brand not wild bill s even the texture is totally different from wild bill s not recommended
negative,7/7/21,these little taffy s are expensive i think i paid around for the pound they taste good but man do they give me gas after eating about my stomach would be rumbling for a few hours and i would have to pass gas a lot my girlfriend wouldn t let me eat them before bed hahaha there was never any pain involved just gas i know it was these doing it because we tested it over a few different days i wouldn t eat the taffy some days and would be fine all it took was a few pieces and an hour late the bubble guts would start this information may be useful since its not on amazon sugar free does not carb free a pound bag is g from the manufacturer website ingredients hydrogenated starch hydrolysate partially hydrogenated soybean and or coconut oil acid combinations for flavor citric acid and or tartaric acid egg albumin salt lecithin sucralose natural and artificial flavors combinations of red blue blue yellow yellow nutrition facts serving size g amount per serving calories cal from fat daily value total fat g saturated fat g trans fat g cholesterol mg sodium mg total carbohydrate g sugar g protein g
negative,25/6/21,i purchased these because they do not contain dairy soy or corn well in addition to being dairy free soy free they are flavor free absolutely horrible dry tasting bars first words out of my mouth were tastes like dirt so that s what i m going with do not waste your money
negative,17/4/21,in proportion this drink is about equal to a regular soda in calories and sugar content but i would prefer a regular soda than this stuff there is a slight citrus taste but mainly from acidity and a horrible after taste of metal and sickly sweetness that lingers for several minutes after wards soda water with natural juice should be a refreshing pleasant and nice refreshment but none of these traits are in this drink i would be embarrassed to serve this beverage to anyone i liked for any occasion but would consider giving it to people i really didn t care for to see their reaction avoid this one orange crush or a different orange soda diluted with soda water would taste far better or soda water and regular orange juice would also be a treat that puts this nasty stuff to shame
negative,13/2/21,if you like orange crush you may become a fan but it s too much of a hybrid for me the main two ingredients are reconstituted apple and grape juices it contains something called acerola juice which is high in vitamin c and indeed the can contains of your c and of your a the sugar content is high grams which brings the carb percentage up to for the day and the calorie count to i think it tastes too acidic for anyone who is watching carbs and calories to be willing to spend them on switch which almost tastes like carbonated tang i ve tried the ooba drinks and they are much lighter and more refreshing guess i m just not ready to make the switch
negative,7/1/21,the product may be every bit as healthy as they claim but even if that s true i could barley get down one can of this stuff it tastes like sour orange juice with some carbonation in it it doesn t taste anything like orange soda and the taste it does have isn t very pleasant also leaves a very nasty aftertaste and like many sodas this will leave you more thirsty than when you started drinking all in all i cannot recommend this stay away
negative,17/4/21,i expected to like this drink because i like various fruit juices and i like carbonated beverages as well unfortunately i just did not like the consistency or the taste of this drink it was thick had very little bubbly carbonation and for me anyway there was a very unpleasant aftertaste that lasted a loooong time i finally brushed my teeth really well and used some strong mouthwash to get rid of the taste in my mouth
negative,14/1/21,this is for sure not what i was expecting it to taste like it s not bad but not for me i like the carbonation and juice idea with no added sugar when i first took a sip of it i noticed it has a bite to it the best way i can describe it is a non alcoholic champagne i however did like it better than the watermelon but still not for me
negative,14/10/21,my daughter i were excited about trying this flavor as we both love orange juice this product did not impress us enough to order it as we liked other flavors more my son also tried it and didn t care for it the orange tangerine flavors are masked by the other fruit juices and makes it taste odd i like the fact that has added vitamin c and is a healthy alternative to sodas but the flavor on this one needs tweaking
negative,7/2/21,i wasn t sure what to expect with this citrusy fizzy drink it was okay though not something i d buy often and certainly not worth the price in my opinion it wasn t as orangey as i expected and it wasn t until i had half of it gone that i read the ingredient list and saw why orange juice is actually the fourth juice listed on the ingredient list with apple and grape juice first and second and the tangerine that seems to tone down the sweetness slightly the third on the list when you look at the nutrition information this product has about forty more calories than coke classic and despite not having any added sugar the grams of sugar in this product is more than an equivalent amount of coca cola the only bonus of this over real soda is the vitamin c and a there isn t much else nutritionally to speak of
negative,17/4/21,the product says a twist because of carbonation well after pouring the drink over pieces of ice the carbonation was gone the carbonation is definitely light and does not last as far as the taste goes i did not care for the taste at all it left a bad after taste in my mouth i cannot recommend this product i will stick with regular juice at a much lower cost to be fair i gave it two stars because my wife thought it was ok
negative,10/7/21,i was offered the opportunity to taste this product because of vine i would not normally purchase this type of product so my review and opinion will be biased in that regard i m not a big soda drinker i d just rather drink water or coffee i will occasionally drink a diet soft drink usually diet pepsi or diet coke did you know that a single oz can of coke classic has calories and grams of sugar this oz can of switch has calories and grams of sugar and this is healthy ounces less is size same caloric content and more sugar per ounce that classic coke ok so it s not added sugar but still that s a lot of sugar orange juice oz has calories and grams of sugar the can says it is orange tangerine but in fact the contents are water concentrates of apple grape tangerine orange and acerola juices then they throw in some gum acacia natural flavors and colors and some ascorbic acid vitamin c and as a little surprise bonus they have added soy soy i asked my wife to taste this product with me i poured the drink into two glasses and we both took a sip her reaction was swift and strong she hated it i agreed with her it was for me sickly sweet and left a sugary aftertaste in my mouth not only that but the taste was just nasty it didn t taste at all like orange or tangerine to me it just tasted terribly sweet with an undefined cirtus something taste the carbonation did not add anything positive to the experience neither of us finished drinking our oz portion it went down the sink i would not purchase this product in the future and if i could have given it stars i would have it s that bad
negative,10/3/21,i drank a single can of the switch orange tangerine flavor today upon first impression the physical size of the can is a tiny oz or ml this in contrast to a regular can of soda size which is ounces or ml therefore only about the content of a normal can of soda to say the least this isn t enough liquid for me in one sitting i need more to drink than that to quench a tiny bit of thirst so i was quite disappointed without even opening the thing up the taste of the drink itself was satisfying since there is no added sugar which is usually corn syrup in the us the flavor was not too sweet nor was it too bland however it wasn t anything like drinking a fresh bottle of natural juice more on the side of mixed syrup with water what kills this product is the high price product right now comes out to about a buck a can i would be angry paying that out of a vending machine for its small size but for purchasing in bulk it is an insult to say the least not worth the money
negative,25/4/21,this is not orange and tangerine juice it s mainly apple and grape juice flavored with orange and tangerine and i really don t care about the vitamin c content vitamin c is easy to get what i do care about is that this is definitely the worst tasting soda of any type that i have ever tried i couldn t pour it down the drain fast enough
negative,1/3/21,the switch orange tangerine looked very promising juice with some zippy carbonation i placed it in the fridge and let it get a nice chill hours later i popped the top and my wife and i sampled and it tasted like drinking furniture polish it s not like we we re searching for derogatory statements about switch here is how the conversation went wife takes a swig looks at me with eyes all googled yuck it tastes like furniture polish i take the can from her thinking she must be insane i chug some down ah yeah it does taste like furniture polish we poured the remainder down the drain if you enjoy drinking cold tangerine flavored furniture polish by all means by the way this drink left a nasty aftertaste still belching it up
negative,10/3/21,switch tastes more like chemicals than juice i was expecting something along the lines of orangina instead it s closer to orange soda but without the carbonation level that makes orange soda enjoyable for a small drink oz it s pretty high in calories frankly i don t think the flavor is good enough to justify the caloric level bottom line if you re die hard soda drinker this might be a better option for you if you re a die hard juice drinker stick to juice if you want fizzy juice add a little seltzer to your fruit juice
negative,28/9/21,ounces and a tad expensive is what i d say about this drink grams of sugar is also a negative for me i m not a sugar lover all in all not big enough to quench my thirst and not delicious enough to find me coming back for more natural but not that intensely citrus
negative,20/4/21,the only good thing was that it was not sweet but the taste was just bad i could understand and tolerate the taste if it was an energy drink but this is not an energy drink i have been very open and have tried different carbonated orange drinks and i have to say this is the least favorites of the other carbonated orange drinks i prefer just mixing carbonated water with orange juice
negative,7/9/21,i almost never write reviews but i thought i would for this one i m pretty open to tastes of anything but something about the smell and taste of this product was really bad it tasted off almost i m really disappointed because i had hoped to like it and i love fruity green teas but this was no good i d strongly recommend trying a sample of this if possible before buying sorry zhena s maybe i ll like another flavor i haven t given up on you yet
negative,2/10/21,i tried many teas and thought would try this kind saw it on dr oz show didn t like its taste
negative,23/9/21,i do not like sour taste and this has a sour kind of taste which i don t like the smell isn t that great either
negative,25/5/21,tasteless basically says it all i love tea drink it every day i found this undrinkable great packaging but not a good tea for me
negative,7/9/21,i bought this tea because i had consumed the one from the bottle and i like that one however in tea bag is not just tasting totally and completely different but additionally tastes really horrible believe me i even tried to give it to my co workers for free after they tried it and they did not accept it in my opinion it tasted like serum s now i have tea bags wasting space probably soon they ll go to the waste bascket it s sad i thought it would taste like the bottle or at least close but totally a disappointment
negative,3/6/21,in court as i understand it you re not supposed to testify about anything where you don t have direct experience you can discount this review if you want since i have only second hand experience with this soup i gave a case of this soup to a young friend who is a college student i worry about her starving she never mentioned whether she liked the soup so i asked she finally admitted that it was to quote her the worst thing i ve ever tasted apparently her boyfriend also tried it and thought it was bad as well while my friend is rather picky her boyfriend has a much wider culinary range so if they both disliked the soup i m inclinded to think it s not very good
negative,10/1/21,this is a good decaf coffee but i ve never before had a k cup dump the contents into my cup it s extremely irritating to deal with grounds in the cup and machine when deliberately choosing a system that avoids the mess
negative,26/3/21,i m not a gourmet coffee critic but this stuff is disappointing based upon previous good reviews i suspect that the coffee in the k cups i received is not the same they may have changed the manufacturing the wolfgang puck decaf i received is lifeless watery and tasteless there s no aroma when it s brewing in the keurig never again
negative,24/3/21,i tried this product solely for the fact it has wolfgang s name on it i should have stuck with timothy s brand this was way too strong to be labeled a breakfast coffee more like a dinner coffee i will not be buying this again also way too expensive compared to the others
negative,19/2/21,i thought it had a bitter orange flavor however my husband and friend liked it
negative,28/7/21,i thought this coffee was really horrible had one cup and will throw the rest away because it can t be returned
negative,31/8/19,but the taste got sickening quite fast it also makes a really weird stench smell when you are microwaving it sometimes it would hurt my tongue when i am eating it all in all i threw the rest of them away after my rd bag it might just be me but i can t say i would let the guests of my home try these so i can t recommend them here to anyone
negative,2/2/20,i normally rate whatever items i buy but rarely offer words of advice well these things changed my mind i love pork rinds usually i buy a tub of them from sam s but since i m the only one in the house who eats them they go stale long before i can make a dent in them so i saw these and the positive reviews and thought hey that s the perfect solution it s a perfect solution all right a perfect solution to get me to stop eating pork rinds i made the first bag as per the directions i had no problem with them crisping at all they were perfect in that regard nice and crunchy but the taste is awful i thought perhaps it was a bad bag nope the second batch tasted just as terrible i have no idea what they use to flavor them but it tastes like a strange mixture of salt and soap there s enough salt in them to kill a horse which in and of itself wouldn t be so bad i actually like salty things but when combined with whatever garbage they dug out of their backed up shower and called seasoning it left me hunting for listerine or gasoline whatever i could get my hands on to get the taste out of my mouth i m still shuddering from it if you like the taste of feet go for it if not i d suggest heading to sam s to buy the wonderful tasting pork rinds we all know and love
negative,23/5/20,so i made one bag of these pork rinds it came out good i decided to try another the taste was unbelievable it had an ammoniated taste smell to it i thought that maybe it was a bad bag i stayed away for a few weeks decided to give them another try bad idea they tasted like ammonia again this wasn t caused by incorrect cooking time because they all came out looking puffy and crispy i ended up throwing the box out
negative,22/11/20,i got these for my dad from his wish list he thought they would be spicy and flavorful but they just tasted like cumin and had a funky smell the box came with individual bags but after you open one bag it s impossible to even want to put yourself through that again they are nasty avoid them at all cost yuck
negative,17/10/20,for a microwavable chili this stuff and the firehouse variant do taste good however i never get to eat the full container because it tends to explode in the microwave i ve followed the directions exactly on the label as well as tried some tweaking and nothing so far has prevented it from exploding the problem is the plastic lid that is to be left on it is left on because it is vented but covers the chili to keep it from splattering irony is there is not enough venting the chili plugs the holes and as it boils and water vapor expands it basically becomes a messy bomb in your microwave i wish i could say it was user error and that there is a way to enjoy this without the mess so far the firehouse variant hasn t exploded on me but it also has less meat and beans to it since the firehouse variant is not really all that spicy i may just stick with that until campbells can make this not a bomb
negative,16/10/21,there are several types of teas in the world indian ceylon scented teas like jasmine there s oolong black green but one thing binds all these teas together they taste like tea this substance has no flavor only an astringent quality it is not drinkable plain which i suppose is why people require all sorts of recipes adding sugar or spices anything to give this tea some flavor and take away the horrid bitterness i think it s even worse than the bagged lipton tea if that is possible in the bagged tea they don t put dust in the teabags because it would fall right out of the bag but since this is loose tea lipton saw fit to add dust twigs anything but the actual leaves what should you drink anything you like i suggest browsing this site called the english tea store no affiliation just to get an idea about what types of teas it is possible to purchase i astounds me that anyone could drink this substance and call it tea it is not tea it is particles of bitterness dust pieces of twigs black and tasteless leavings of what used to be a tea plant what the hell is wrong with you people to drink this stuff by the way i have nothing against some lipton tea but when you drink this stuff you need to add lemon sugar or cream something because it is awful stuff trying to drink it on its own if you have to buy tea at a supermarket try the twinings darjeeling that s a decent blend you can drink
negative,20/10/21,these were fair i don t feel they are aa quality would not repurchase
negative,4/8/21,first of all the tea is gross it tastes nothing like bubble milk tea secondly the seller must know this product is less than expected because they sell it in incriments of two lb bags now i am stuck with two bags lbs of this junk i want my bucks back
negative,9/10/21,i have tried several different types of sugar free chocolates and this is one of the worst instead i recommend the dove dark chocolate and the russell stover coconut
negative,17/10/19,i ve fgound the cure for drinking too much coffee inthe morning get this one i thought when i first had this that i had accidently wiped the sugar spoon with a mr clean cloth but the next day i had one cup of tully s and made the second cup the green mountain breakfast blend the disinfectant taste was back i would not buy this one again
negative,4/7/21,unfortunately i am highly disappointed with this product it is devoid of flavor they pride themselves on the history of the product i could ve done better at my grocery store in the candy aisle i would ve actually preferred a heath bar i tried it on three different days thinking possibly it was me then i had a couple friends try a couple pieces and my assessment was proved to be correct i threw away the majority of the two pound container one hour before the trash collectors arrived so the raccoons which often find their way into the garbage no matter what precautions you take wouldn t have to suffer eating it what a waste of my hard earned money you ll notice if you search google how dominant this company is believe me i nor will anyone i know ever waste a penny on this product again yes this review seems harsh but i rarely take the time to do this the only reason i have is so you don t waste your money regards to all ron
negative,11/9/21,purchasing the glace de volaille gourmet gold roasted turkey stock from amazom i used the reccomended old world gravy recipe of sauteing onions carrots in duck fat with a cup of wine it did not inspire me the traditional basted american turkey with pan drippings for gravy cannot be substituted the aroma of a fresh turkey in the oven stirs the senses exciting the cook to prepare for a perfect gravy this cannot be duplicated in a gravy package that is designed for a gourmet market that prefers its gravy deaden in wine brown onions and thyme maybe the old world tastes are more astute but my american gravy will remain simply traditional the glace de volaille gold roasted old world gravy recipe well it went into the trash
negative,2/8/21,with both a stomach problem and a love of coffee i thought this would be a great solution i was wrong i just didn t care for the taste i recommend trying some low acid coffee once somewhere you can get a small cup before purchasing a pack of bags for home brew
negative,2/8/21,i ve eaten a few of these and while they tasted interesting at first i can t bite into one now without gagging i m not a vegetarian but i was looking for some high protein snacks so i picked these up a vegetarian friend of mine tried one and instantly hated them calling the taste disgusting and the texture too much like meat the taste is not something that grows on you and i can not recommend these to anyone especially at this price
negative,19/1/20,searching for a replacement for ghirardelli s excellent but discontinued expresso escape bars i tried these unfortunately i ordered of them i tried parts of of these and could not detect any hints of chocolate or coffee in any of them i kept trying them because i could not believe what i was not tasting ended up throwing the rest away
negative,26/7/21,i was quite excited to try these cocoa roasted almonds out i love almonds and i love chocolate and most reviews of this product imply that you get your fix of both without the extra sugar well there s definitely a whole lot less sugar in this thing it tastes pretty bad to me and i was quite shocked i guess i need at least a little more sweet but i m shocked because i m not that much of a sweet tooth it s the bitter after taste that really bothers me with this product i really couldn t take it so just fair warning to those who might think this is going to be a great combo of chocolate and almond think again this is really just cocoa and almond and for me that left a very bad taste
negative,24/2/21,i only had one packet to test of this product and i put it into a oz glass of hot water it is mostly ginger flavored with just a hint of lemon the ginger is so strong that it actually tastes a bit like sweetened pepper and it leaves a kind of nasty taste in your mouth after it goes down perhaps it might be better if you only added a bit of the packet to tea or only used a bit of the packet in the water because the ginger is very overwhelming i was hoping for more lemon flavoring to balence out the ginger this probably is good to settle the stomach if you can stomach the flavor so this won t be a product that i d use again
negative,17/12/20,it does not taste like pure coconut water its taste like some drink with coconut flavour i wouldn t prefer these bottles instead i would go for zico smaller packs they taste better than these bottled drink
negative,28/7/20,i was excited to find zico on auto delivery but really disappointed in the new packaging and recipe i ordered boxes and they had a plastic after taste i thought maybe it was just this batch so i waited for my next order same thing taste like plastic and made from concentrate it use to be so good cancelled my subscription today
negative,9/5/20,consistency is ok but product is absolutely tasteless might be possible to add to other cereals but not much fun to eat by itself
negative,12/3/18,i tasted wonderful cheese popcorn at the palmer house in chicago and thought this might be the same when sprinkled on hot buttered popcorn sorry i had to purchase six as i can t even give them away absolutely no taste whatsoever even when you use a massive amount of it on popcorn don t waste your money
negative,10/11/19,the coffee is great tasting but is expensive in my book if nestle hadn t sent me the machine for free i wouldn t have bought it it leaks and is not a great machine for an office our office doesn t like it because you have to keep going to the bathroom to refill it with water because it only holds two cups worth of water it does make a hot cup of coffee in a very quick time though
negative,28/6/20,thought it tastes funny not like iced tea not like lemonade and no where in between there are much better flavors out there
negative,20/11/19,i didn t like the taste of this very much it was ok but it tasted a little odd i loved their white lightening chicken chili but don t recommended the chicken noodle soup
negative,20/11/19,like eating soft plastic we pored them in a big pile in the back yard under the trees the squeals will not eat them
negative,15/3/20,well do you know how difficult it is to find white rice puffed rice only company that does it is quaker millet doesn t cut it sorry won t but it again have tried all the puffed rice products most don t tell you that these puffed rice products are brown rice puffed rice truth in advertising i think not brown rice puffed just doesn t have the taste of white rice puffed i can still find it at albertsons at around bucks a box
negative,5/8/21,very little taste weak and no caffiene that i can tell i even emailed tao of tea about brewing suggestions and got no reply
negative,31/7/20,it is not worth the money it does have a terrible taste i bought one so far and stopped buying it and threw the unused coffee in garbage if you want a good tasting instant coffee try nescafe classic or nescafe gold available everywhere on earth but parts of the us
negative,15/1/21,tasted bland did not have the freshness and aroma of sping onions would not buy again
negative,14/1/21,honestly i used to buy this frequently before they stopped caring it in my grocery store so i was actually quite excited to see its availibility online i m not exactly sure what s up with it but it has absolutely no taste whatsoever very big disappointment o
negative,21/7/21,i have a picky dog with tummy troubles who has to eat a prescription diet she loves the newman s treats but they are too hard for her since she is missing half her teeth still occasionally i hear a crunching sound and she is munching down a newman s i was hoping she would knaw on these treats and thought the center would be a little easier to eat here s how the trial went me opening the bag you want a treat dog tail wagging ears perked up and looking at me intently me i pull one treat from the bag and hand it to her dog she takes it carefully and sets it on the floor sniff sniff she looks back up at me sniff she walks away and lays down in her bed me i pick up the treat and sniff and don t smell anything this doesn t mean much since i m not a dog i pull on the outside wrapping it s pretty tough i push the middle up a little it s hard i was expecting a softer middle i taste the middle it s tasteless i tried again to tempt her with one of these treats by giving it to her in place of our nightly bite of cheese ritual once again she just sniffed of it and then ignored it the other treats i ve tried with her beggin strips puperoni blue bison apple yogurt biscuits milk bone she will either attempt to eat or carry around in her mouth for several minutes looking for a safe place to hide it these treats don t even get the honor of being buried
negative,7/1/21,i ordered this product hoping it would really change my mind about using whey or soy i did not i have to mix it with my other protein just so i can drink it it taste like dirt and grass not s very good product
negative,24/5/21,i typically go for breakfast blends but this coffee simply tastes bad i d recommend trying some variety packs rather than buying one big pack as i did
negative,7/9/21,first let me say i am a huge fan of endangered species chocolate this is my first time however trying this particular mixture i love orange and chocolate as a combination but this one definitely falls short unfortunately from what i can gather and the type of bitterness it is i am guessing they add too much of the pith while creating the orange oil it has a smooth delightful start but the more you eat the more pronounced the bitter taste becomes i am disappointed by the purchase and will not order this type again
negative,19/10/21,this is mostly dry croutons with very little flavor i need to try to find some way to salvage this mix as no one will eat it the way it is right now i was expecting something more like chex party mix but was greatly disappointed it should have much more flavor spice to be enjoyable as a snack mix as it is it has less flavor than a bag of salad croutons or plain pretzels
negative,2/11/20,the chips had an odd texture tasting nothing like a corn chip the seasoning was more of a salsa flavor than a cheese it was even difficult to give these away to people
negative,23/11/20,just when i got my shipment i tried it out on my pit but he only ate portion of it and he never ate it after that so i also tried it on my rottweiler and she does not like it also the only way they would eat it is if i add some caned meat with it then they would but that shouldn t be the case so i don t recommend
negative,22/7/19,i love regular merengue cookies and i normally don t have a problem with sugar free but these cookies had a terrible taste and worse texture stick to the non sugar free
negative,15/6/21,this blend is bitter and does taste earthly like drinking mud really it is the wake up blend is much better
negative,4/8/21,if you like vanilla you will love this i am not a big fan of vanilla and this literally tastes like i am eating the melted vanilla ice cream out of a bowl much too sweet for me
negative,16/1/18,i had expected the peach tea to taste like peach and it does not very disappointed
negative,10/7/21,very disappointed in the taste nothing like it is described tastes very watery with some sugar added to it bummed i wasted my
negative,2/8/21,i recently went on a gluten free diet where this hurts the most so far is breakfast there is barely any flavor to this cereal i picked up mine from whole foods not amazon i d rather it was fortified by vitamins and even though i m sure it would taste worse at least it would have taste and do me some good it really isn t filling the barely darkened milk doesn t taste chocolate though does lose some of the good taste of the only thing with taste the milk i don t know if it is the rice flavor or the general lack of flavor but there is a hint of staleness i think could i add sugar sure and then i d taste the sugar or sugar substitute but that doesn t make it more healthy to be fair it isn t bitter or too salty or too sweet or sour so there isn t anything there to offend if you are eating it fast enough it won t be mush if it has stopped making noise you are in danger of mushiness it makes some truly good snap crackle and pop noises i suppose the cereal is bad enough to encourage you to eat some fresh fruit to have a good taste in your mouth and remember to take a daily vitamin i can only take those every other day it is cheaper than granola when i can afford it i m totally getting outrageous gluten free granola i also have envirokids to try next
negative,11/6/21,i am a huge vita coco fan i drink it almost ever day this flavor terrible i cannot believe that vita coco sells it stay away
negative,26/6/21,i wish rihanna would get her face off this product it tastes nasty i bought a couple dozen since i love vita coco s products however this flavor is just the worst they tried and the taste has a hint of guava but it doesn t work in this package i have tried giving them away and nobody wants them i still haven t seen anyone who likes the taste

negative,18/12/19,it contains too much fat and when you bite it than you can feel the fat in your mouth it s disgusting
negative,14/4/21,thought i d give these a try because i was looking for an afternoon slightly sweet snack bar that s high in protein low fat and great tasting well these are high in protein which i like are low in fat which i like but i think in their processing to make it low fat they compromised on the flavor i was expecting a more natural peanut butter taste but was disappointed with the texture and taste artificial i will not buy these again i m stuck now with the whole box my hunt continues for that great snack bar
negative,13/5/20,tastes funny it was not labeled from china on the info page when i bought it i will not eat this product will not give it away can t return it only thing left to do is throw it away will not purchase any food from china my health is more important
negative,7/2/21,i didn t like the taste of this at all i tried the stevia packets before and didn t like them and i thought this would taste better because of the vanilla flavor but i still didn t like it
negative,14/5/19,my husband and i have each tried drinking this coffee a few times and it tastes bad a real chemical artificial taste do not recommend it we are throwing away the rest of it which i don t like to do but i wouldn t try to pass it off on a friend

negative,22/3/18,i did not care for the taste or texture i was able to get rid of these by sharing them at parties
negative,23/3/18,this is good if you like hay for breakfast also it gets soggy quickly if you add mueslix it greatly improves it
negative,8/5/20,this has too high of a sugar content i didn t know they add sugar to coconut water its supposed to be natural i am trying to avoid processed sugar this is my last order
negative,9/3/18,i had high hopes for this product it was reviewed on the local morning news and i got the impression that it was a good low calorie substitute for ice cream in my opinion it is not a good substitute at all it doesn t taste like peanut butter at all and barely tastes like chocolate my daughter tasted it and thought it tasted gross i wouldn t go that far but i will never buy it again especially since it costs so much more than ice cream i ll probably take the suggestions of other reviewers and use it as a base for a shake i have only tried the chocolate peanut butter flavor so i can t vouch for the other flavors
negative,17/5/20,i have been buying the fireworks popcorn from amazon and have been very happy with it i bought this to try something different first of all i was disappointed by the rather small container for the price but then i was very disappointed by the taste i use canola oil in an electric popper this popcorn had a slight taste of insecticide i tasted it in every batch from the jar it was a very distinctive and unpleasant taste
negative,20/11/19,the coffee maker works fine i am not impressed with the taste of the coffee it tastes too much like instant
negative,25/6/21,not as good quality as the regular flavors of senseo coffees and we have had our machines for over years medium and dark roast kona and breakfast blend are by far the best sumatra is good also if you like dark rich coffee love the ease of the pod system but will probably go to the k cups just not available enough anymore
negative,21/10/21,the mushrooms i received had absolutely no flavor it was like soaking up cream sauce with pieces of rubber really disappointing
negative,9/12/20,i am disappointed in this product first there s a distinct aftertaste secondly it is not as sweet as they promise and doesn t work at all in cold drinks if you need a sugar substitute i suggest somersweet not perfect either but better than this sorry i was taken in by the promises
negative,14/1/21,this product is sweetened with splenda and tastes very artificial maybe if you like diet soda you will like this but the people that sampled it did not
negative,6/6/21,the seeds are really good but this new flavor is a big time miss the taste is just terrible i bought a whole case i don t know if i will eat them i have to put a bunch in my mouth then put in some water rinse the flavors off in my mouth and spit all the liquid out just to eat the seeds i don t know what they were thinking on this flavor it is rather indescribable they should ve made a spicy bbq or cajun instead
negative,5/1/21,they came during a heat wave so some of them melted however that s not the issue they tasted burnt and just not that good the ones at trader joe s are soo much better
negative,14/1/21,i recently got a keurig coffeemaker and tried out different brands of decaf to come up with a favorite newman s own is definitely not among them taste very much like a cheap restaurant coffee watered down with hardly any coffee taste i happen to like robust coffee taste and this one doesn t even qualify as medium if you like good coffee taste in your decaf coffees i would highly recommend the green mountain robust magic and for a little lighter touch the donut house decaf or tully s also of all the different brands i tried the newman s own was the only decaf that gave me an acid stomach reaction not recommended
negative,7/12/20,ok so some people like it some people don t i m one of those who was excited about the prospect of getting iced tea from my keurig but was sorely disappointed by the taste from this tea it had a very artificial flavor much like instant tea and was no comparison to actual brewed iced tea i can only recommend getting the smallest box you can to see if it suits you like the other reviewer i can t bring myself to use what s left and will probably end up throwing it out at some point my husband agreed and he s a big iced tea drinker and not all that picky about the taste he won t drink it i won t drink it and the cat won t drink it so out it goes i do want to add that i use the hot teas and have liked them very much especially the green tea there s just something about the iced flavors that don t work
negative,1/7/21,really bad taste not natural at all we bought a pack but only used one i wish we hadn t bought it
negative,15/7/21,these don t even taste like cashews they are fresh and crunchy enough but you would never know they are supposed to be cashews i don t know anything about roasting cashews but i think it s funny that every other brand seems similar in taste and emerald does not it s not that they have an off flavor they have no flavor
negative,18/6/21,i am shocked at the positive reviews for this tea it is almost completely tasteless just a slight fruity flavour it does not resemble any green tea that i have bought in the past when living in japan or from asian markets in the usa there is not a hint of green colour in the tea and the leaf is dry large and not compacted at all in the bag in fact the leaves are too big to fit in a tea ball does this tea really contain more antioxidants and polyphenols can not find substantiation from usda they talk a good talk but product is severely lacking
negative,7/7/21,coffee was burnt had a bad aftertaste and very acidic note sure if a bad batch but this was not good coffee
negative,8/6/21,this product has bad reviews because it is quite horrible unlike most of the keurig k cups this one tastes very artifical it is extremely bitter and not sweet it seems like it has excess cocoa and artificial sweetner yet all watered down
negative,10/3/21,i did not like the taste of this hot chocolate and my kids didn t either i will not buy again
negative,14/1/21,tastes terrible i should have known given that it was on sale but i am throwing the rest of the case out i have tried it twice now and once poured it out thinking i had a bad one and the nd time bearly held it down
negative,7/9/21,this is an edit of my first review where i said the price was a little high but at that point i hadn t noticed that both my local walmart and target carry it for less than so don t buy it here though it s a great coffee i use this coffee as a drip grind coffee not french press or expresso where so many people love it it s still stars this coffee is excellent it s called a dark roast but it tastes more like a medium or medium dark roast and doesn t have much bitter burnt taste so common in such roasts it s woody with a hint of a citrusy taste it s a little creamy and earthy there s a considerable complexity of tastes which reminds me of eight o clock s bocar blend but bocar is not as bold but it is around the price eight o clock s columbian my most brewed in the am coffee is as bold with a little less complexity and a more woody taste again at the price it most closely reminds me of starbuck s caffe verona which is a little more chocolately in taste and is usually around for one about same sized bag at amazon
negative,6/9/21,i have been a licorice lover all my life and black licorice laces are my favorite type of licorice this product has been impossible to find where i live i have searched every store around but no store supplies black licorice laces after finding it on amazon i ordered it immediately but i was very dissatisfied with the taste of gustaf s licorice it did not taste like the real black licorice but some artificial substitute and it was way too soft it didn t please me any more than the twizzlers do it s just not a real licorice flavor i would never order gustaf s licorice again
negative,23/9/21,this is a poor excuse for coffee even for instant coffee i was looking forward to trying it after hearing good things on the web unfortunately i was disappointed i tried this coffee using the specified instructions and also tried using less water the best i can say of it is that it is weak garbage it is almost like drinking hot water but with a foul taste that will leave you longing for a real cup of coffee if you want fast coffee allow me to suggest a keurig b special edition gourmet single cup home brewing system instead
negative,11/9/21,i got this tea thinking it would be a nice tea reminiscent of the kind of hot cider drink you might get from a coffee shop what i got was a rather unpleasant experience when i first opened the box at work my co workers said this tea smelled like the cinnamon chewing gum big red when i got to the first sip i encountered the sweet flavor of the apples before i was quickly overwhelmed by the very bitter taste of cinnamon it felt like two siblings who were not on good terms with each other face scrunching ensued i will not be finishing this box
negative,22/7/21,this product was very tasteless and boring i felt like i was eating packaging material awful awful awful awful very bland
negative,24/3/21,i opened my box hoping for a great snack to go and what a dissappointment it tastes like the fat is rancid in these i opened another box to see if maybe i got a bad box but they were just as awful my dog won t even eat them
negative,14/12/20,i was hugely disappointed with this product the walden farms line of calorie salad dressings are great this alfredo sauce is not do not waste your money on it
negative,1/4/20,i first tasted this product at the grocery store i bought the oz container and loved it unfortunately the taset of the one coconut water from amazon was horrible it had a strange taste as if it had been left out in the heat it was a rancid flavor i will not be ordering this again i ll purchase it from the grocery store where i can take it back easily and quickly
negative,16/1/18,i can tell you from experience that it is not hard to make healthy low calorie low sodium soup that tastes good calories for this soup are ok and it has a few carrot pieces in it for a little extra nutrition however the taste was totally bland it is commendable that they used less salt however they could have added a little rosemary and or garlic for example and produced an enjoyable taste without one bit of extra calories or sodium i also found the chicken to be overcooked and rubbery as were the pasta curls that they think are noodles yesterday i had a can of progresso classics vegatable that was the same calories more nutricious and full of flavor even the old fashioned small can of campbell s chicken noodle is a better bowl of soup than this no more healthy choice in our pantry
negative,17/10/19,i did not like this product at all it made everything i used it to make taste the same horrible
negative,8/6/21,recently i was over watching the celtics game at my friend s apartment as the game grew more and more intense i consequently grew more and more parched hey brian i said you got anything to drink yeah he replied i ve got some lavender soda in the fridge lavender soda i asked skeptical where does a person even get lavender soda it was sitting on a table next to a couch in the furniture section of marshall s so i bought it brian replied i walked to the kitchen my interest piqued drinking lavender soda sounded like a wonderfully unique experience as i typically enjoy the scent of lavender soaps however i would soon learn that drinking a flower flavored soda would not be the exciting experience i had hoped it would be when i took my first sip i thought to myself what have i gotten myself into this time the initial flavor tasted like club soda that had been poured into a glass that contained soap residue from a previous cleaning interesting i thought perhaps the flavor is just subtle at first however as my drinking experience continued i came to realize that this would not be the case after i swallowed the soda i was faced with an aftertaste that rather than tasting like soap residue tasted simply like soap like a bar of soap was in my mouth this brought back horrible memories of my childhood you see when i was but a young boy my mother would always threaten to wash my mouth out with soap if i either said a bad word or said something disrespectful to her or my father being one to always question my mother s conviction i often found myself with a bar of soap in my mouth this had a tremendous lasting psychological effect as even twenty years later i can still taste the flavor of soap in my mouth when i consider saying a bad word consequently when i took my first taste of lavender soda i was hit with a flood of emotions i felt as though i had said a bad word or broken a rule i felt as though i was being punished for something but could not recall what i had done my vision began to become cloudy i began to lose control of my small motor functions i was soon reduced to a bluthering mess on the floor after being bombarded with such deeply buried memories i vowed never again to sip of such a soda as long as i shall live lest i suffer another episode such as the one described above in summary this soda tastes more like lavender scented soap than it does soda it might be better suited for a more delicate palate than my own but i personally do not prefer it
negative,19/1/20,it s a joke that they market this as basmati rice since it is not even vaguely similar taste wise texmati will surely disappoint indian food lovers
negative,13/9/20,i have had martinis with fresh bleu cheese stuffed olives in the past and these are tasteless in comparison i could not distinguish the taste of bleu cheese take the time and stuff your pitted olives with fresh bleu cheese or find another already prepared brand

negative,29/6/21,i love the regular version of this soup and accidentally bought a case of the low sodium version no amount of added salt improves the overwhelming blandness of this product
negative,16/9/21,my mother in law received this tea in as a gift for christmas and i had a cup and it was delicious it was in sealed packets this tea is in paper packets like lipton tea and does not taste any thing like my mother in laws don t be disappointed like i am and save your money and do not buy this product unfortunately i had to open the package to see and taste this so i could not return it i would give it no stars but i had to give it one to post

negative,7/2/21,the flavor of the two does not taste lie strawberries and vanilla in my opinion for being naturally flavored they do have a manufactured taste i tried one of each before giving the rest away
negative,17/4/21,i was very disappointed i love good cider having grown up and gone to the mill each year i like most grocery store cider as well this stuff was really bad tasted to me like raw chemicals went through or people who spit it out directly not my machine they liked the tea and coffee and even ran hot water between to see if that was it

negative,2/5/21,i m utterly baffled by the positive reviews for this product now i ve been using stevia for the past year to sweeten my coffee i have no issue with the stevia i used to drink a lot of soda and then a few years back a lot of diet soda since then i ve been able to give up soda altogether but my dad who is diabetic is absolutely obsessed with diet coke i ve been trying to get him to lessen his diet coke intake which is a day but he just waves me off so i did some research read the reviews and bought packs of the cola and lemon flavor each i tried both to see how they tasted and was totally confused by this tasteless carbonated water there was no taste it literally just tasted like carbonated water with a vague hint of some flavor i can t imagine anyone wanting to drink this stuff let alone rave about it did i get a bad batch my dad will never be able to transition from diet coke to this stuff because this stuff is truly awful so disappointing

negative,24/10/21,i think these peppercorns are bland tasteless it lacks the pepper spiciness will never buy this brand again it was a fail choice to say the least
negative,18/10/21,this is fine it s just not all that perhaps if i had special equipment that would make it without getting little floaties in my cup i would have given it more stars i used a fine mesh strainer and poured the boiling water through twice and perhaps if i didn t get an unimaginable headache a half hour or so after drinking it i might have gone for three stars unsure whether this caused the headache i have to try it one more time but the end result tasted like tea nothing special and at per bag uh i d rather go for celestial seasonings if i want some caffeine free tea beverage drink so if you have an espresso machine and want to branch out into tea this might be for you otherwise go for some loose leaf and steep the hell out of it
negative,1/7/18,i usually use twinings english breakfast loose tea this was a poor substitute for that this tea has a strong earthy taste almost like dirt rather than tea
negative,10/8/18,i usually choose english breakfast tea because it has a rich flavor this tea was practically tasteless i could go out in my back yard and randomly pick weeds and it would taste better than this stuff i recommend taylors of harrogate if you re looking for english style tea
negative,1/8/20,i love chocolate shakes and malts and i m playing around with ingredients to achieve flavor with fewer calories i bought some carnation malted milk to add to the mix and make a malt unfortunately this stuff had no malt flavor that i could detect and it made the result undrinkable i m throwing away the rest of the bottle

negative,21/10/19,this made us sick perhaps we got a bad batch we won t purchase this again and would not recommend it would like to add that amazon customer service was awesome in our correspondence with this product
negative,11/9/21,i just got my order today and had to try it out while i ll disagree with others that have gotten mush outta the can my initial can was above that not what i would call chunks by any stretch but not mush as for taste pretty much none if it weren t for the additives it wouldn t have any taste at all i ve never had blue crab but if this is the comparison i ll not try it either keep in mind that i can get dungeness year round as well as red rock crab i ll likely add it to the cats food maybe she can get some flavor out of it
negative,8/8/21,the badia cilantro ounce pack of has very little taste and what flavor there is doesn t resemble cilantro it is reminiscent of a stale oregano this was a very disappointing purchase and i won t be buying any badia products again
negative,8/7/21,i got this product because i was on the hcg diet and wanted a special treat for valentine s day i was really hoping it would be good but it wasn t this chocolate can be used in cooking i suppose if you add some additional sweetener to it it did not relieve my craving for chocolate it is very bitter tasting when i tasted a tiny bite it was just a little bitter the bar is divided up into blocks when i put a block in my mouth it was awful and i ended up spitting it out it made me think of taking a spoonful of bitter cocoa and trying to eat it also you have to order such a large amount that it is a huge waste if you don t like it they should sell individual bars so people can know if they like it before buying such a large quantity
negative,21/1/21,i have tried a few brands of truffle salt i like it on popcorn i thought that this product would be great since it was truffle instead of the i had been purchasing although the aroma of this product is good the taste is just bad not awful bad the bitter flavor is at the front not an aftertaste and there is not a strong truffle flavor i am very disappointed
negative,21/4/21,after reading the reviews i decided to order a bag and try it i had had numerous styles of kona coffee over the years and love the smell and flavor when it arrived i ground some up and brewed up a pot the smell was there but the flavor was lacking it was missing that kona pop that i have experienced in the past with other coffee s over the next few weeks i tried different brewing combinations no matter what i tried it was quite bland and just did not have any flavor i was quite disappointed by the coffee
negative,18/12/19,i m not sure how or why this soup mix is getting such good reviews it has no flavor whatsoever when they dehydrated the ingredients they pulled all the flavor out i ve tried everything to make a decent dish with this stuff but always turns out bland and tasteless the recommend mix is also way off cups water mix you ll end up with a lintel sludge that is nothing like soup i think i could probably calk my bathroom with it or make a nice adobe hut however if you are into very bland food this will probably be good if you like flavor stay away
negative,19/1/20,i really love herbal tea especially orange and mandarin but all of teekanne s teas were tasteless and even if you put two packages in a cup of tea you still get no taste now i have three packages of teakanne relaxing and energizing and i don t know what to do with it surely will not drink it

negative,6/2/20,the leaf in the bag and the overall packaging quality is good but no one in our family and group of friends likes the taste since it has all the other positive reviews i ve been subjecting people to it off and on since my july purchase trying to find at least one person to say it tastes good with no luck it doesn t taste like peaches to us it has an off taste that makes our gang say yuck we like many different kinds of flavored hot tea and switch between drinking black or green iced tea usually decaf and usually made as sun tea some of us add sweetener some of us don t we like peaches both fresh and canned for these reasons i can t blame our dislike of the taste on the simple fact that it is flavored and a green tea maybe the passion fruit in it someone else mentioned isn t our cup of tea
negative,29/6/21,this company protected these cookies very well with great packaging but the taste is not there i would never purchase again
negative,31/7/20,these beans have absolutely no taste to them be prepared to add butter salt while cooking them and completely ruining the health factor in the process if you plan to enjoy them
negative,13/6/20,this extract is strange i put a little into my recipe and it sort of had an almost peanut buttery hint of flavor but not quite so i thought it needed a bit more i put in the tiniest bit more and the flavor changed drastically and tasted not like peanut butter but like alcohol not good at all
negative,26/9/20,looking for no points but this has a funny taste on weight watchers but prefer pb so will take the pt value

negative,20/8/20,first i would like to say that i purchased this product from the store not from this seller also that there was not a problem with the expiration date of the coffee i am not a picky coffee drinker i like all kinds but i prefer stronger brews i like flavored coffee as well but only when it tastes like what it is suppose to i don t think anyone wants to drink chemical flavored coffee when i bought this product i thought it was going to be great i am a consumer of folgers and have tried different flavors of theirs however this was the first k cup brand i bought from them and was very disappointed the coffee is definitely flavored and does taste like caramel but after each sip there is an after taste of some sort of chemical the after taste is so strong and disgusting that you can neither enjoy the flavor of the coffee nor the caramel for the first time was unable to finish my cup of coffee to drink the entire cup would have been the equivalent of torturing myself i would not recommend anyone buy this product
negative,15/1/20,kraft italian salad dressing fat free ounce packages pack of big mistake i am stuck with packets of these horrible tasting salad dressings kraft has a decent rep when it comes to items like this but they really missed the mark when they produced this item horrible very salty taste perhaps because it is lite dressing although i have tried other kraft lite salad dressings and they were not bad does anyone want to buy packets of italian dressing i will more then likely wind up throwing these out unless someone in my family decides to try them and likes them

negative,25/7/21,these are much lower quality than the usual poppy seeds i purchase as some of the other reviewers described they have almost a dirty taste to them and not much normal poppy seed flavor they are not good for baking i m wondering if they are used for something else like poppy tea which would explain their high ratings by others i ended up throwing out both bags pros cheap price non irradiated fast delivery cons poor taste not baking eating quality unusable for eating cooking so cheap price doesn t really matter
negative,6/9/21,i wish i could give this product a negative number for my review this is the worst thing i have ever purchased here on amazon in the last yrs of using this wonderful site please don t buy this product it literally taste like dirt i can t believe anyone who has tried this product has liked it noticed i haven t called this product by it s name cinnamon reason because it s not it s dirt save your money and go pick up mccormicks cinnamon what i had to do if the people that make this dirt read this review please contact me and let me know how i can get a refund and return this dirt to you you guys should be ashamed of yourselves for selling this dirt and passing it off as cinnamon

negative,2/12/20,i was extremely disappionted when i opened my shipment of enjoy life on the go bars very berry carmel apple and cocoa loco the boxes are now a plain generic design you know the kind all brands change to when they want to make their products look cheaper i then compared the ingredients of the new shipment with the older boxes i still had at home guess what cheaper ingredients next i taste tested and let my year old help he wouldn t eat the new ones and i can t blame him they are oily and bland i thought enjoy life was a brand that actually cared about using quality ingredients to make a good tasting product i was wrong in summary these are way too expensive to be made with low quality unpalatable ingredients
negative,20/11/19,this product described as organic raw cacao powder from peru is clearly inferior to all other raw cacao powder i have had the taste of this product is definitely not as good this product has a bitter muddy thin taste as compared to the fuller richer taste of the real thing from other vendors as soon as i tasted this product which is destined for the trash bag i understood why it was cheaper than organic cacao from other vendors it is nowhere near as good spend a few dollars more and get the real thing
negative,12/2/21,this product taste stale and is full of artificial ingredients no real peppermint is in this product and to be honest it does not even taste like real cocoa is either

negative,20/10/21,i ordered this item on march nd i expect to get its replacement from the people at blue sometime today so what s a month anyway the first one that came from amazon had a constant high pitched tone i emailed then called blue and eventually spoke to a pleasant tech support guy who was aware of the problem he allowed that the company had shipped out a number of units with this defect that s always good to hear so several emails later i received a return merchandise authorization and shipped it right back to them who knows if this one works maybe i ll like it blue s products look good but they make a strong case for buying locally
negative,20/11/19,we have been using newman s organic dry dog food for over years it was a godsend when we discovered it our little jack had such severe allergies she was tormented day and night with unrelieved itching after trying endless other avenues to find relief for her we were to the point we thought we might have to have her put down for her to find relief then the idea came up that maybe she had chemical sensitivities so we decided to go organic all her deals miraculously cleared up once we started the newman s however after giving glowing reviews for many years we now have to concede something has changed our little jack s itching returned to the point of drawing blood it is clear something changed and i believe it clearly is no longer as organic as it once was we are on the hunt again i am not saying it does not have good quality ingredients but if you have a dog that is highly chemical sensitive this likely is not for you too bad it once was a superior product
negative,30/9/20,i received these in bad condition most of them were broken but the ones that weren t had holes in them they were so weak that they would tear when you tried to roll them i would try three ladies brand they are a way higher quality

negative,11/9/21,i bought nutiva organic chia seeds before two pouches ounces each with tax this brand in one ounce pouch the quality and the taste are the same but the latter one is way much more expensive buy nutiva organic chia seeds not navitas in terms of the taste i usually toast mine and add them everywhere cereal yogurt oatmeal etc tastes great and full of fiber
negative,29/5/20,lipton does taste good but it s not a good quality tea if you open the tea bag you ll see their not tea leaves but tea dust cheep even the loos lipton tea is described as being broken down so you need a fine filter to strain it when you steep good tea it should unfurl and look like spinach they say this tea comes to an oz let us do the math devided by oz i buy my tea from set to a tea it s really good tea with flavoring and dried fruit pices it comes to an oz for a tin or for a refill weather you buy it loose or in bags you get the same quality tea i went to a tea party last year like a tupperware party but more fun where the chick told us all about the different kinds of tea and gave us samples
negative,9/10/20,when i received this item i was very disappointed with it it is rather cheap looking and i wouldn t want this on my counter for all to see the left side of the tray was lopsided and looked strange when you pulled it out needless to say i boxed it back up and sent it back for a full refund definitely not worth but after seeing it i would have been equally disappointed had i paid only
negative,31/7/20,i had been buying these treats for my cavachon for the past two years he loved them the last batch was of noticeably lower quality dry and crunchy rather than moist and chewy i don t know if this is due to the shift in manufacturing from the us to china or coincidental in any event i will not be buying these any more and have switched to other treats note amazon would not let me return this item and i am within the day purchase period i m not pleased
negative,31/7/20,material is very thin and the shirt had several spots where the color was faded the only thing that it had going for it was the fact that it was cheap but i guess sometimes you get what you pay for
negative,31/7/20,i go through a lot of coconut milk and this is the only brand i ll buy because native forest is the only company i know of that uses bpa free cans however the product is very inconsistent sometime i get wonderful rich thick coconut milk and other times its watery curdled and gritty the watery stuff does not do well in my recipes at all i saw other reviewers said it has to do with whether the cans came from sri lanka or thailand i will not be ordering these from amazon even though it is more expensive at the store i want to be able to make sure i m getting the thick coconut milk it s really unacceptable that two completely different products are being sold as the same product
negative,23/11/20,i just received my pack of bulbs and of the don t work and another one has debris floating in the tube the bulbs that work appear do work well however there is no excuse for poor quality back they go
negative,29/8/20,sorry for the long delay i really do not like to write negative comments but this was delivered to my mother in law stale and bad she threw it out
negative,19/7/21,the packaging was intact and all but when i opened the box i found that the greenies were stuck together and wouldn t break apart even when i tried smashing them against the concrete at some point they must have been moist that they had become so cemented together it is a struggle trying to pull one at a time out of the bag and they break apart not exactly what i wanted
negative,27/6/21,i ordered this product for my niece as one of her christmas presents when i opened the ups package the handle to the gingerbread box was broken the box was also dented in places the taste of the icing was horrible however it was a fun project and none of the gingerbread pieces were broken would not buy again
negative,13/9/21,did not like flavor left significant residue in cup and flow was limited into cup tried and plan to return very disappointing
negative,6/7/21,i had purchased the premium variety of these treats when costco carried them and my dogs loved them i bought the original recipe treats here because the premium was too expensive what i recieved was a bag filled with broken and crumbled pieces and a lot of dust amazon shipped it thrown in with several books with no padding around it one of my dogs flatly refuses to eat the treat pieces the other dog would eat sawdust if i offered it to him which makes me think they have gone bad since i cannot find a use by date on the package i do not trust that this is a wholesome safe product the remainder has gone into the rubbish for the safety of your animals i advise that you not purchase these from amazon i believe they sell old product
negative,27/7/21,the quality of these cups were awful several of them broke open in my keurig brewer and leaked grounds into my coffee this has not happened with any other brand of k cups
negative,10/3/21,some of the cinnamon sticks have patches of mold other sticks smell like smoke not cinnamon previous orders were okay but this batch will be my last purchase of this brand grocery stores sometimes pull questionable products from the shelves until quality issues are resolved with the supplier there needs to be an equivalent online response
negative,17/4/21,i have long haired dachshunds which like to dig out in the beginning the fido cs worked but was not powerful as it would not shock through the long haired coat of my dachshunds they had to hit it with the face or shorter haired skin exposed underbelly areas in order to get a good reaction on them i had the fido cs set up for maybe months before it stopped working completely and the dogs were back to getting out again no it did not get wet as my husband built a wood box for the charger house of protection it just stopped working and by that time i had thrown away my receipt which was from a small garden center on an old type register so that it didn t list the product name anyway thus no warranty proof nor refund available i am looking for a better quality charger which will hit harder through the long haired coat i have had stronger chargers which worked better and lasted longer than this model the fido cs
negative,15/1/21,unfortunately i believed that by looking at the packaging i was getting the old style gum which has a lesser chance of sticking to the paper when carried in my pocket for a few days than the new cheap gum i loose more gum now because it sticks to the paper after i ve carried it in my pocket for a few days the old gum was less likely to stick to the paper under the very same conditions needless to say i am quite dissapointed in wrigley s decision to cut the quality of their doublemint gum and also needless to say this will be my last purchase of any wrigley s products they had a good gum before if it ain t broke don t fix it
negative,6/3/21,the first time i ordered this it was great after adjusting my grind it made the perfect espresso with a thick crema however subsequent orders left much to be desired some were ok some were horrible none were great
negative,17/4/21,i bought this product from target after i had done what i thought was enough research on baby food makers i was originally going to get the baby bullet but the reviews were not good at all so i went with the brezza instead mistake i remember that a few people had written about the poor quality and bad customer service of the company itself not amazon when i opened it the tape used to secure it within the plastic bag was melted so there was sticky stuff all over the bottom of the thing i had to scrub it as soon as i took it out of the box after it had gotten sticky melted tape all over my kitchen counter that was annoying the plastic covering over the buttons looked like it was lifting as if it had been used or something even though it was brand new i tried the motor and it worked it wasn t terribly loud i d probably rate the noise a on a scale when i went to wash it prior to first use of course the directions said to remove the driveshaft prior to washing it said all you had to do was to turn the canister over find the knob and turn counter clock wise that driveshaft must ve been welded in there because it took me and my husband over an hour to loosen it enough to get it out of there i was honestly scared to put it back in for fear that i d never get it back out again i got over it and prepared to make my first meal carrots i followed the directions and cut up the carrots to the appropriate size but when i went to put the water in there was a discrepancy the directions said to put in ml of water and that the canister had a premeasured line that could be used so the amount of water would be correct normally that wouldn t be a problem except that the measured line read ml seriously so i m left trying to figure out which one is correct i ended up going with the premeasured canister and i think that it was too much water because the carrots came out ridiculously watery there were also still chunks of carrot in the mix it wasn t easy to get the food out around the blades either i can see how people would say that it might be a time saver if it worked and was of decent quality then it would save time you just set it and walk away but the end result leaves much to be desired and for the price you d expect to at least get your money s worth you re honestly better off just getting a really nice food processor and going the old fashioned way
negative,14/1/21,this candy had previously been melted candy was stuck to wrappers this would be ok to eat but not to share with friens

negative,10/3/21,i am always looking for healthy treats for my dogs i had ordered boxes of these and when i opened the first box something had eaten their way in or out the treats were full of holes and there were also holes in the plastic i could not see from the outside any evidence of something getting in they were also out of date by a couple of months i contacted the the people that i purchased these from and they wasted no time in giving me a refund i was very please with the seller s response

negative,25/5/21,i purchased this item because i wanted the tea chest the item description is completely inaccurate it states that it is a wood grain tea chest the chest is a cheap box that is very poorly covered with a wood grain contact paper i say poorly because the faux wood contact paper has ripples and bubbles all over it please don t waste your money or time on this item like i did
negative,7/9/21,i ordered two boxes and the k cups are less than half filled with coffee sounds more like little maracas also leaves grounds at the bottom of cup apparently there is not a return policy for these k cups very bummed out
negative,25/8/21,this item comes in a pkg of bags the first one was like dust it even smelled like dust when i ground the beans no coffee scent at all i just opened the nd bag and it does smell like coffee and much better taste too but it s so not worth having to throw away an entire bag that makes the cost per pound way more than this coffee is worth
negative,25/5/21,my dog hates this food and through some research i have found that science diet is not very good quality i have instead switched over to orijen a little more expensive but worth it for a healthier and happier dog
negative,23/9/21,a majority of the pods are defective they either don t have enough air pressure in the pod which results in non consistent coffee taste or they are poorly sealed which results in coffee spilling out the side of the pod into your keurig either way i will never order this brand again
negative,7/9/21,i received this product and eagerly offered the dog the first biscuit out of the box she stepped back and walked away without hesitating i smelled the biscuit and it had a rancid peanut butter smell to it i checked the other in the box and they all smelled the same bad what a shame since we had purchased these previously and the dog enjoyed them i won t be purchasing anymore online and will stay with the local pet store for fresh treats
negative,7/9/21,i didn t like the bob s red mill golden flax seed because it had too many pieces of stems and dark discolored flax seeds in it i thought the price compared to some other sellers was too high i will not purchase this product again
negative,11/9/21,i drink tea everyday and was excited to find such a great deal on this tea regrettably the only good part about this tea was the price the tea tastes somewhat bitter and earthy and not in a good way and is weak also i will not buy this again and will stick to pg tips or yorkshire gold
negative,26/3/21,these are not the york peppermint patties that i am accustomed to they are very noticeably made of lower quality ingredients after i took a single bite i could tell something was wrong so i checked the packaging and sure enough these are manufactured in mexico i saw on another variety here on amazon that people were complaining about the quality of the made in mexico york peppermint patties this product is a waste of money
negative,14/12/20,this is the second time i have ordered this product the first time i thought it was very good this time however it tastes as though it has been watered down the consistency is thinner and the taste is weaker i will not purchase this again
negative,19/10/21,i carefully read all the reviews on this item before ordering i must say there are not that many real tea drinkers writing reviews for this particular item sure if you are a lipton dipper this is a great tea but if you know what a quality tea should offer you would not have given this product more than stars the aroma when first open the bag is quiet decent but when the tea is brewed the flavor is a disaster it is basically a lipton like flavor the color is also unlike a good quality earl gray which it should have an amber color that can be anywhere from light to deep end of the spectrum depending if the tea is a single body or need to be mixed with another tea for potentiation of color at last the tea leaves are not uniformly sized which basically means this tea is probably a mixture of low quality teas just flavored as earl gray coffee bean direct should consider offering a better tea for a few more at least lb of tea would be worth brewing
negative,14/12/20,i didn t purchase this from amazon although i was about to since the pack is so much cheaper than buying individual bags at the grocery store so i thought i d try a couple of bags to see how i liked them the first bag was wonderful plump sweet juicy pieces of ginger nicely sweetened with a good hot ginger hit the second bag was awful mushy ginger and some pieces with strange unnatural textures and the ginger was way too hot in that second bag not sure what s going on but i also tried a couple of bags of the reed s and liked their ginger much much better and the quality was consistent
negative,10/4/21,after being pleased with my first order of these rawhides i set up a recurring order for them we received a box last week and were disappointed to find that the quality of these bones is not the same as the first order the first order of bones contained rawhides that were tightly rolled and long lasting but these have inner layers that are brittle and easily broken one of our dogs actually cut her mouth or gums on the brittle shards we didn t realize it until we saw blood on the bone itself amazon is refunding the purchase price i may try one more time with this brand if anyone has found a consistent quality brand at this kind of price please let us know maybe my budget is the problem
negative,2/2/20,i have bought vanilla beans for several years for making homemade ice cream i always buy from amazon because the supermarket vanilla beans are usually old and expensive i just received my order of these and was very disappointed the beans were stiff not pliable as a good vanilla bean should be they did not have an oily feel to them which is another sign of quality and freshness also there were less of the seeds that you get from the inside of the bean which is where most of the flavor comes from compared to previous purchases i have made finally they did not have a very strong vanilla aroma no where near as strong as other vanilla beans that i have bought in the past i just used beans from the last order i bought well over a year ago along with these vanilla beans that i just ordered the old ones were much better in quality than these new ones despite being quite a bit older i always vacuum seal the beans after i use them to help keep their freshness but the other vanilla beans are still well over a year older than these new ones and were far better in quality
negative,2/2/20,the fruit arrived in a timely fashion but much of the fruit was not ripe and quality was very poor most of the fruit delivered was fruit easily obtainable at most grovery stores for a fraction of what was charged for this basket don t waste your money
negative,30/1/21,our pound dachshund absolutely loved this toy but in less than a week he had the face chewed off the eyes chewed off the tips of the ears chewed off and a hole in the tail plus had removed both squeekers i don t recommend this at all i m just going to keep buying the toys that last the same amount of time
negative,22/7/19,i was looking forward to trying this bold coffee flavor which was supposed to have a sweet flavor however although package arrived earlier than promised the beans were old dull not glossy without evidence of oil on them which fresher beans would have lacked powerful smell if fresh would have been strong when opened consequently this coffee tasted poor watery after beans were ground and dripped
negative,1/4/20,i bought this as a gift for my husband and it was disappointing the quality of the chocolate is very poor closer to hershey kisses than dove or godiva the bacon flavor was off kind of bitter and more like bacon bits than actual bacon overall i wish i hadn t wasted on bars of sub par chocolate i know you want to try this for yourself because you think that everyone is being too picky that s what i thought too but don t save your money and make your own chocolate bacon bar at home
negative,1/6/21,sold by amazon the package arrived leaked with caps unsealed and easily opened when used the liquid ran out much faster than normal can t believe amazon sold used products very unhappy

negative,2/9/20,i placed my first order for this product in march of and i was very pleased with what i received i had never tried coconut milk before the coconut milk was thick and creamy if i didn t shake the can before opening it there was a layer of very tasty cream at the top i finished my first case at the end of may and decided to sign up for amazon s subscription plan for roland coconut milk the new case arrived very quickly but the content of the cans was not the same this time the coconut milk was watery and had a flavor i was not fond of there was no layer of cream at the top of the can and it just sounded differently when i shook the can being of much thinner consistency both products were roland organic coconut milk i did notice some slight differences on the cans the thicker tasty non subscription cans were australian certified organic had a copyright and were a product of thailand the watery cans that came with the subscription had a klbd symbol on them were certified by control union certifications had a copyright and were a product of sri lanka both cans listed the same ingredients and nutrition information i should also note that i had no problem with the packaging of my first non subscription order there were very minor dents on about of the cans but nothing that made me consider throwing them away the packaging of the subscription order was a mess it was completely falling apart and a can fell out of the box when i picked it up i haven t actually opened the box i ve just slid the cans i ve opened out of the holes in it the one can that fell out was dented but i think this was a result of the fall the other can was in good condition if i had reviewed this product after receiving my first order i would have given it five stars the lack of consistency in the product quality and the poor flavor of the nd order lead me to give this product a star review
negative,30/7/21,i bought keenan farms pistachios once earlier that batch appeared to alright this time around the product is not upto mark at all i have bought pistachios from local stores also which are far better and cheaper than this i have opened only one bag from the that i have received if any one from keenam farms is reading this i can return these to them so that they can see what is in the bags sent to me

negative,10/8/18,i absolutely love this stuff but i pay to for a pack in the grocery store why is this price so high
negative,16/1/18,go to costco and you can buy lower than this price per oz currently off regular tax for big size oz besides it is more convinient to return if you kid does not like this formula be careful many times some sellers over price a product and still make the product rank in the best sellers
negative,1/7/18,beware of what you are being charged it says that it s but drugstore is charing you plus in shipping i ve found this to be true for several other items on this site i m not sure if this is a misprint amazon doesn t seem to think it s an issue since the seller can charge whatever they want for the item i disagree and think it s amazon s responisbility to get to the bottom of this
negative,10/8/18,this food is phenomenal but way overpriced i pay a case in new york city and it is often on sale for less than a case at babiesrus in new york city grocery prices are obscene in ny so if i am paying less here this is no deal
negative,10/8/18,i bought these for my wife for her birthday she loves chocolate and its a staple gift i give her well this year i got her these she only ate one and put them away very strange later i caught her putting them in the garbage when i tried one i quickly realized why they taste like they have no sugar in them and leave an aftertaste that reminded me of badly burnt toast i had to brush my teeth to get the taste out we had a good laugh about it fortunately i also gave her a necklace which she really did love so they didn t ruin her birthday dollars wasted

negative,22/9/21,i love all different types of beef jerky but not this one it has the flavor of grocery store bought beef jerky once you get over the overwhelming taste of salt these sticks are cut thin making them tender and easy to chew but they re just way too salty and definitely not worth
negative,25/7/20,skittles are a great candy but for this product i would say do not buy it here i have seen this same bag for on sale and not on sale for at some big chain stores the candies themselves are fine and if you are thinking of getting a big bag you know what they taste like just don t overspend to get a big bag price wise might be cheaper to buy a bunch of little bags
negative,4/7/21,i have enjoyed this product for quite some time however i am disgusted by the fact that the price keeps increasing at per case customers are paying more than per box for small cookie bars ridiculous i will find a healthier more reasonably priced snack to munch on shame on nana and amazon
negative,11/9/21,i decided to give these a try the lids are very difficult to put on and i often ended up bending the cup while trying to affix the lid they do not seal perfectly and i often found unexpected puddles but they do the job since i have a keurig permanant filter i thought of just buying the paper filters to save on cleanup for almost from this vendor you can get fifty paper filters i would just assume use paper towels that works out to be just under cents for a small piece of paper disposakups please re evaluate your pricing
negative,19/10/21,you can order the same products online from nespresso for approx and you can specify exactly what you want to buy rather than taking a mixture of items some of which you may not like nespresso makes great coffee and great machines the nespresso capsule offers posted on amazon however are all by third parties who prey on people who don t know better

negative,22/6/21,when i bought this food i saw the image and price and assumed that i would be paying a fair price less per bag than the grocery store for low grade cat food the image and price combination led me to think that i would be paying for lb bags a good deal when i received six lb bags i thought there had been a mistake nope so i spend returning it i bought three packs oops and now ozbo customer service tells me they take weeks processing returns my kitties need food now and these people want to sit on my for that long do not buy from these scammers
negative,30/7/21,this is a good product especially for iced coffee but why is it twice the price as it is in stores this isn t a fluke within the past two months i ve bought it for a jar in seattle and in nevada so it just looks like good old fashioned gouging try harder amazon

negative,25/6/21,this is a great product my baby loves it i especially like the smooth liquid formula versus the powder since the powder never seems to dissolve properly i am however rating this low because of the seller is ridiculous this product normally sells for but they are jacking up the price because there is a shortage of the liquid formula due to the powder recall you should be ashamed amazon this is food for a baby makes me ill
negative,11/6/21,i spent close to for each cube which turned out to be the oz size i know it says that upon further review but i was assuming it was the lb size because that size is at the grocery and i just paid the same thing for the lb size shame on you amazon or better yet shame on me the expiration date is fast approaching too so i m not even sure i ll use these up in a month i was very disappointed in the price as well as the expiration date i had the same issue with some sunflower seeds i bought recently they expired before baseball season even started however i did get what i paid for it s just my mistake for not realizing the size was not what i thought i was getting who would pay that for the lb size
negative,8/7/21,very disappointed in this heed the bad reviews i am now at the lowest amount of brewing and it still tastes watered down need to dump some swiss miss hot chocolate in there to give it flavor and that point what was the purpose with the product already being overpriced shop elsewhere as it was and tasting watered down it just wasn t worth it skip it maybe a different brand will be better

negative,20/8/21,unsaid in the description of this item is the fact that you receive only one box for the same item can be purchased directly from dreamfields for only which probably explains why this ad does not reveal the number of boxes in an order
negative,14/8/21,love these little packs of raisinets hooray for portion control and when i saw them on amazon i thought it was a great deal boxes of packs of raisins i pay around for a pack at the grocery store so this seemed like a really good bargain boy was i wrong i didn t get boxes of the packs i got one six pack which according to amazon has a retail price of bucks that s insane fortunately a quick chat with customer service refunded my purchase but i was still disappointed to find it was one pack and not

negative,7/9/21,i was surprised when the catnip arrived to find it was only a one ounce tin the listing did not say how much was in the tin my fault i guess i just found the same size tin of this same catnip at a high end natural food store for only this is good stuff but overpriced and can probably be found locally for a lot less
negative,25/5/21,plus to ship that s almost for a box of cookies that costs about in the store is this guy smoking something are people buying these at this price these are a good cookie but in no way are they worth a box just another rip off there is even a much cheaper alternative right here on amazon keep looking you ll find a much better deal than from this guy

negative,19/2/21,this new packaging is more expensive than the last plus it s smaller oz vs the in the old packaging granted it s nice not having to fish around for the scooper but there s no reason to increase pricing on this target had the oz for at one point maybe try to clear old packaging for new now it s at still cheaper than what i ve seen online even for amazon so far
negative,18/5/21,too much of a good thing we worked this kibble in over time slowly shifting the percentage of felidae to national junk food brand until the bowl was all natural by this time the cats couldn t keep it in or down what a mess we ve moved on
negative,19/2/21,this candy is not as described the middle is almost hard it is not a silky or smooth filling as described looks and tastes like it s way past it s expiration date would never reccommend this paid a good chunk of cash for nothing
negative,18/5/21,i ve been drinking this tea for the past or years usually buying a box or two when visiting large metropolitan areas where many middle eastern stores carry loose ahmad teas usually at for a pound box i ve always considered it an unremarkable but robust tea with enough aroma and taste and beautiful reddish color perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own but a decent base for mixes this tea however is nothing of the sort freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell and the brewed tea is weak flat and tasteless somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore so you get a lot of tea for the money but the quality is such that you might as well drink lipton bags they are not that much worse
negative,18/6/21,five minutes in one tentacle was bitten off ball inside cracked in half not durable enough to be a dog toy disappointed so is the dog
negative,7/7/21,i felt energized within five minutes but it lasted for about minutes i paid for this drink i could have just drunk a cup of coffee and saved my money
negative,18/6/21,yes it s probably healthier than hour energy or starbucks shots but if you re looking to avoid a caffeine overload this is still not for you most energy drinks cannot be made w out a high dosage of caffeine i believe the caffeine content of guayaki shot is ml probably lower than other un healthy energy shot drinks but i believe most other people avoid the top brands b c they contain too much caffeine and or sugar if you do not react well to caffeine guayaki is not a good buy either i definitely feel an energy boost w full guayaki shot but not w out all the other caffeine side effects irritability nervousness mood swings caffeine overdose is why i stopped drinking coffee but it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe now you re not sensitive to caffeine then it s a great buy it s not loaded w sugar the taste is easy and pleasant it s not loaded w a bunch of chemicals like hour shots or starbucks drinks and the energy boost lasts for about to hours takes about to minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body weight side note if you want to feel energized during the day have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy
negative,7/7/21,i so wish i would have read this review before purchasing two gallons of this oil for my health issues it reeks like a chemical rubber smell this smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid when i called to report the situation to the company sabrina told me i would have to pay to send them a sample to have tested by a lab unbelievable good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund including shipping the product is faulty period i will never order anything from this company again and do not recommend it to anyone based on this horrible customer service and lack of responsibility and ownership
negative,1/7/21,this product has a strong after taste of crayola crayons i am in the process of trying different brands of coconut oils for cooking purposes upon opening the plastic container the aroma of crayons immediately fills the room and this flavor permeates the food that is cooked in it i suspect the source of the problem is the plastic used in the plastic container as i have not experienced this with any of the other brands purchased to date my favorite coconut oil is distributed by barleans the flavor is fantastic however they do not supply a gallon sized tub and dr mercola has the best product in that size category
negative,7/7/21,i used to buy this sugar for years i do not eat much sugar but still this sugar is called turbinado sugar but is misleading i picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar and other brands in the local food store that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something how did i find out i needed just a sweet water few days ago i put this sugar in the raw in the glass the water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just pure white sugar crystals what a shame on the producer you can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well i m just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice
negative,23/7/21,this is the first time i ve really been misled by other reviews on amazon i like hr energy i find rain ok and so i thought i d try this product based on the reviews boy am i sorry i gagged getting one bottle down even with my nose pinched really and it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards tic tacs at once did not get rid of it but worst of all within an hour i was yawning and drowsy unless you really like things that taste of a weird tea flavored cough syrup and don t work don t buy this i don t know what to do with the other bottles big fail
negative,20/7/21,the package came with the label torn off and no cooking instructions i know how i normally cook couscous so tried cup water to cup couscous brought to a boil and let sit covered for min it was mushy and tasteless we have thrown out the rest of the container

negative,21/7/21,this mix is very poorly packaged and breaks open easily during shipping nearly a full bag of my order was spilled in the shipping box bags out of had come unsealed at the top there were no tears in the packages
negative,18/6/21,i like kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked i bought a bigger sized bag from costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly so i don t know why these were different will never buy these chips from here again
negative,7/7/21,i really love kettle brand chips but these are rather disappointing there is very little sour cream or onion flavor
negative,30/6/21,i agree with the other review these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums the chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt vinegar combo unfortunately every bag i received in that case was over cooked they were very dark and only a few golden brown chips in each bag they definitely need to improve that
negative,1/7/21,i was really looking forward to trying these chips since i love cheese but i was super disappointed i am a big fan of kettle chips but these tasted somewhat stale and almost plain they are supposed to have a cheddar taste but you cannot taste any of that it s annoying i do not recommend this flavor salt and vinegar and buffalo bleu are my favorite
negative,24/8/21,these are perhaps the worst chips that have ever gone into my mouth for my entire life sour cream onion and in this case chive chips were my favorite recently kettle brand honey dijon mustard took that slot so when i found out they had sour cream onion i just had to try them as soon as i opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk and indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful it tastes like rancid milk not just sour but like sour cream that when rancid the powdery texture is also extremely unappealing i basically hated these chips i would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery chalky texture on a chip with a rancid and onion flavor and i have a hard time believing that person exists i plan on contacting kettle and sharing my thoughts with them hopefully they ll reassess the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips
negative,21/7/21,kettle chips now look feel and taste like lays these chips used to be my favorite when it was crinkle cut and hefty now no longer my favorite
negative,25/6/21,these were nasty they were so greasy and too rich for my blood plus they lacked major flavor no spicy jalapeno flavor at all i was so dissapointed in these chips i am always hearing great things about these chips but i am telling you yuck yuck yuck give me pain chips any day maybe there is a better kettle chip brand out there but i am staying clear from these chips i wish i could give these zero stars if i could
negative,13/9/21,being a salt free product is why i purchased this but the chips are quite greasy
negative,18/6/21,when originally produced in england these we re the best chips i had ever tasted but unfortunately since they were bought out by the us conglomerate they now taste plain nasty hard rather than crispy are much thinner than they used to be and lacking any flavour a real shame
negative,7/7/21,after opening numerous bags i found that none of the chips had any flavoring on them completely plain and gross how does this even happen
negative,15/7/21,i ve bought these at the local supermarket and enjoyed them although they are so salty that a few leave my tongue and roof of my mouth burning keeps you from eating too many occasionally i get really stale items from amazon com and this was one unedible beware of the quality of food items on this website that are on special as they can be very close to due dates or in this case not expired but stale and unedible just the same
negative,11/7/21,i ordered kettle chips in the following flavvors salt fresh ground pepper tuscan cheese n y cheddar and hers they all tasted the same to me if there is a variety pack suggest you order before ordering large size i wish i could return the unopened bags
negative,7/10/21,i purchased these because of the low salt and they were indeed low in salt however many many of the chips in the bag were literally dripping in oil i have never encountered this problem with other potato chip brands it was very unappetizing and who wants all that oil i will never buy these again and i would not recommend them to others
negative,6/7/21,if you are looking for strong s v flavor these definitely aren t for you very mild in comparison to many others i live in tx and i can tell you i ve tried all s v chips i can get ahold of the best of the best are heb storebrand and world market bob s and zapp s aren t bad from a chip standpoint they have typically great kettle crunch but if you re looking for s v flavor these have just a touch
negative,18/6/21,i don t know if it was the case of chips we received or what but everyone we allowed to sample the chips in a buffet style setting agreed that these were slightly on the salty side one person jokingly stated that these would be terrific for melting ice and snow due to the amount of salt in these we had ordered these with the expectations that these would be similar to the lay s kettle mesquite potato chips but these kettle brands outback bbq chips are the exact opposite sorry folks we just had better expectations from these chips but they a little on the on the salty side we are still looking forward to amazon finally getting the lay s kettle mesquite potato chips in stock these got a star because the bbq powder they had used on these were flavorful enough to be unique
negative,7/7/21,these chips are greasy and taste burnt there is grease in the bottom of the bag and the chips are saturated with it especially at the bottom of the bag even if they are trans fat free they need to be a lot less greasy
negative,27/7/21,don t waste your money on any of the kettle brand potato chips i bought a case of these and a case of the cheddar and sour cream both cases ended up in the garbage can
negative,13/7/21,used to eat the spicy thai flavor all the time message makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was message free now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage a bunch more salt and message stuffed in under the label yeast extract they removed the no message from the label so they know very well what they did the worst part though is that they taste horrible instead of crisp oily and full of character say as if they were cooked in like a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays the spicy thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid what a shame no more kettle chips for me it seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method do not be fooled into paying a premium price for these chips as they are not a premium product anymore
negative,13/9/21,terrible i cannot believe this i received this item and every single bag was opened but i m stationed in afghanistan and this was going to be a snack for my team while going out on missions i was so embarrassed when the bags were opened and spilt out all in the box gross and the box is filled with grease stains i do not know if it was from the airplane ride all the way here but the box should have been more insulated and bubble wrap should have been used instead of paper i m very unhappy with stale crusty chips out the bag and us soldiers cannot enjoy now
negative,7/9/21,kettle branch potato chips new york cheddar these are good if you like kettle fried potato chips that are waaaay salty on the burnt side and taste rancid either because the cheese flavoring or the oil it was fried in was already old i want to like this brand of chips and try their new and other flavors every now and then but after having tried all sorts of other brands of kettle cooked chips these just don t hit the spot for me
negative,17/4/21,for those of you who like me had to order the kettle spicy thai chips from amazon because they are so hard to find locally you will probably be aggrieved to know that the recipe has changed they are just like regular potatoe chips i paid for them but now my husband gets to eat them because he didn t like the spicy thai but these are fine for him yuck
negative,10/3/21,while i admit that the oversalted chip is addictive i really think this one has gone too far skin literally peeled off my lips and inside my mouth after eating these i am surprised that they are still on the market
negative,17/4/21,there is nothing too good or too bad about these chips if you like plain potato chips you d like these they are thicker than most brands fresh out of box very crunchy and not too salty for me one bag has a lot i generally cannot finish it by myself part of the reason is that they are too oily some chips almost look transparent if you know what i mean the taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me if you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice except salt as the name says i don t think i ll buy these again the best by date on my bags are march and i ordered them at the end of october
negative,21/1/21,the spicy thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market however kettle foods has changed the ingredients used with ginger being the most important that is now missing notice that they removed ginger with attitude from the bag sadly the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me they aren t that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non existent here are the original and new ingredient listings original ingredients select potatoes safflower and or sunflower oil honey powder evaporated cane syrup honey salt garlic powder jalapeno pepper ground ginger onion powder habanero pepper dried parsley citric acid cilantro extract ginger oil cayenne pepper white pepper lime oil new ingredients potatoes safflower and or sunflower oil sugar dried cane syrup salt maltodextrin yeast extract spices garlic powder onion powder dried parsley jalapeno powder citric acid natural flavors lime extract i m assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner blue diamond they might want to get rid of great taste naturally from their bags as i don t consider maltodextrin to be very natural great job kettle way to ruin a great thing
negative,30/1/21,i was sent week past fresh by date stock chips are noticeably not fresh in taste won t order again edit and just to add to the dangers of expired stock one of the bags had a rat hole in it black marks on inside of hole very obviously rat unfortunately i put a chip in my mouth before i saw the hole very bad form amazon
negative,13/2/21,and that is the problem i order these by the case of and when they are good which is over half the time they are the best kettle chip the best and then i get a case of the worse the potatos are mealy and old so i just throw them out and order again expensive but when they are made with good fresh potatos they are the best the last case is what prompted me to write this the potatos were weird like they were almost sour as in going bad and i even wrote the company that makes them so if you want the best kettle chip there is try these and if the ones you get are not the best try again i myself am done ordering because it is creeping me out that they are using soured potatos and either not noticing or not caring
negative,15/1/21,i am very disappointed with this product because i could not see how many calories it has at the time i ordered it i received it and now i can see it has calories per tablespoon granulated sugar has only calories per tablespoon how could agave nectar be better than sugar
negative,6/3/21,i was so excited thinking they had my favorite discontinued kettle flavor but was disappointed when i opened the box and found this substitution i am keeping them but would not have ordered bags of this flavor it is a very good bbq chip but i could get this flavor at the grocery store why oh why do my favorite food items always get discontinued the one star is for the substitution the country bbq is a start chip but not the chip i longed for
negative,8/6/21,i guess there s no telling what will tickle the palate i m a huge tabasco fan and i love unconventional snacks but these don t taste to me even remotely like the wonderful sauce they re made from i didn t find them to have much of a kick at all practically bland in fact even with my strong aversion to wasting food i had to throw out or give away most of the case do yourself a favor and find a bag of these locally before taking a chance on
negative,7/1/21,yeast extract is listed as an ingredient sounds harmless right specifically these chips contain autolyzed yeast extract which is on a chemical level monosodium glutamate it s just derived from a different source but it has all the same toxic properties kettle still advertises their products as containing no message while they acknowledge that their chips are not safe for people with message sensitivities
negative,17/4/21,i did not like these potatoe chips it s hot and sweet with an overwhelming taste of garlic it s also a bit salty
negative,10/3/21,unfortunately having ordered quite a few of these previously i neglected to not look for the word supreme in this offer and since i was then receiving free shipping had delivered we that is my husband guests and me knew immediately that these were different from those previously enjoyed but currently amazon featured the supreme babka and now i am awaiting to receive these in the future i will read more carefully
negative,14/1/21,i opened the can and immediately became concerned when i saw what looked like dried white crust rather than fluffy frosting the package recommended stirring before use so i gave that a try and under the crust was an indescribable gelatinous goo the best i can equate it to is a white version of the blue goop the mother serves for dinner in better of dead no raisins in it though i tried to stir it together and the end result was gelatinous goo with white crusties in it when lifting the knife to spread it long strings on goo trailed from my knife i opted for making my own frosting instead very easy a little sprectrum palm shortening a lot of powdered sugar a tiny splash of vanilla a tiny bit of salt and rice milk as needed for consistency beat for minutes and i had the fluffy butter cream frosting i thought i d get from cherrybrook i wonder if our can was overheated in the store whole foods or something i ve read positive reviews of their frosting mix so maybe i ll try that next time
negative,24/5/21,i love cherrybrook kitchen and have tried almost all of their products i was excited to try the ready to spread frosting as i do not usually keep the needed ingredients on hand for their box frosting i am not a picky eater especially if the item contains sugar but this was horrible the consistency is absolutely nothing like regular canned frosting it is not light and fluffy it is very gooey i cannot even imagine trying to spread it on a cake it would rip it to pieces because it is so thick and gooey i did not even try it on a cake because the taste and texture were so off putting seriously do not waste your money
negative,14/10/21,this product was such a disappointment as all the other reviewers said it s a gluey sticky texture more akin to elmer s glue than to an edible food product the flavor was sickening sweet i actually thought that the frosting had spoiled it was that bad save yourself the time and i paid and make your own frosting or go with another brand cherrybrook cake and cookie mixes are so good it s hard to believe they even sell this
negative,7/2/21,i am glad i found this on the reduced rack for c the taste was not bad but no way i could frost my cake it stuck to the knife ran down in strings what a mess i too thought i had gotten a bad batch my gds birthday cake looks like crap who would buy this mess horrible
negative,29/3/21,i recently purchased this on sale at my local grocery store now i know why it was on sale this is not a fluffy creamy white frosting you d expect to find when opening the jar now i wasn t expecting it to be just like betty crocker but it was pretty bad like others said it is a gluey tacky mess that would completely ruin a cake if you tried to spread it on it reminds me of taffy that hasn t quite hit the right stage in the candy making process the taste isn t that great either and it s sickeningly sweet even for frosting the only thing it might be used for is a frosting for cinnamon buns i still don t think it would be the right consistency
negative,17/4/21,i can honestly say this is the worst frosting we have ever bought it s kind of generous to call it frosting it has more the consistency of rubber cement and since we were in a time crunch we didn t have the luxury of going back out to the store for a different frosting so we forged ahead and decorated a cake with it horrible experience bad enough to put us off cake decorating forever it spread about as easily as chewing gum stuck to everything it came in contact with and got crumbs of the cake mixed up in it on top of all this it didn t even taste good by the time we were done decorating we knew there was no way we could feed this mess to our family so we ended up going to the store anyway to buy a pre made cake our cake which took twice as long to decorate because this stuff is so gooey was used as a centerpiece a really ugly centerpiece that cracked and peeled as the frosting dried
negative,10/3/21,my husband and i were very disappointed in this coffee very weak watery cup of coffee a definite waste of
negative,10/7/21,this item werther s sugar free hard candy if consumed will give you or your friends loose bowels i purchased bags and discovered more than a bowel problem you can t return them need a laxative i have ten unopened bags you can have for free
negative,27/1/21,this kind of tea not good taste and smell so wear it s not like tea and feel like some thing chemical
negative,1/6/21,the laddoos turned bad in a few days after we received it no other item inside our fridge turned bad
negative,20/8/21,this is not disco dust which is edible and made for baking do not purchase this product for such purposes
negative,14/8/21,this isn t as easy as it looks doesn t came with enough yellow frosting and the frosting doesn t stick very well my year old did like making it though
negative,21/4/21,i am a preschool teacher and do a g is for gingerbread unit every january i was on vacation during christmas and when i got back not a gingerbread kit was to be found which is odd i needed one for my preschool class and needed it in less then a week i looked everywhere and could not find ont so i had one overnighted from amazon on nye and it came yesterday i pick this one because of the rudolph theme the gingerbread itself came broken like unable to use would need a glue gun to get it to work broken it s non returnable i called amazon they were nice enough to order me a second one since i spend a ton of money each year with them this one also came broken i order a lot from amazon and things do not come broken i think only one time have i had returned something because it was broken in s of orders but two of the same thing in a row i think it s the kit itself and nothing to do with how it was shipped i will say most come ups and overnight comes fed ed but it s bubble wrapped very well i think the gingerbread isn t good and cracks in shipping and breaks off the rest of the kit is very cute the first kit the candies had spilled out and where a mess in the box but the second kit while the gingerbread was all broken up again the candies were all in their bags too bad but i would try something else stay away from this one
negative,1/4/21,the whole idea of a spongebob ginger bread pineapple is really great but the sticker that says use by has a jn date on it if that is this is not good i think it would be fun to make and a cute decoration but my son is going to want to eat it the least the seller could do is to check the expiration date its right on the front of the box not happy at all
negative,17/4/21,this tea carries the flavor one would expect from the smell terrible it invigorates like a puncture wound and the only revival is that after drinking you discover that you are still alive well one tea bag was enough for me my mother in law said oh that smells kind of like wine okay kind of like wine with a hint of rot and a moldy aftertaste if she likes it she can have the whole box
negative,10/3/21,if it were possible to give this product zero stars i would have done so i am a huge fan of twinings teas and was very excited to try this new blend after arriving home from the grocery i immediately started the kettle to enjoy a cup while prepping dinner between sorting washing and chopping items the hot water was added to the bag to steep preparation continued until a distinctly off odor hit me i thought one of my ingredients must be rancid i hunted around for almost four minutes before i realized it was the tea even after cleaning up and airing out the kitchen my roommate later came in and asked about the smell save your money to purchase any other twinings product
negative,22/4/21,cadbury chocolate uses a different formula in each country it is manufactured new zealand is uses more cream than australia etc this version by hershey is not what you expect from england australia or new zealand cadbury it does not melt on your tongue like those countries so it tastes differently if you are looking for the silky smooth easy melting chocolate find the non hershey version hershey has missed an opportunity to introduce high quality cadbury chocolate to usa
negative,25/4/21,the individual pocky sticks are not separately packaged and melt and stick together while being shipped
negative,1/4/21,this product must qualify for some sort of deceptive packaging award the box only contains bars and the wrappers are smaller than normal so at least of the interior of the box is air then when you unwrap the bar you find they are only about the length of a normal snack bar the rest of it is empty air inside the wrapper if they were to not include wrappers those bars would occupy less than of the space inside the box as far as taste goes they are so so on the dry side with a hint of berry flavor celiacs who are used to inferior products won t be disappointed in the taste of this one i ve also had their cookies and they suffer from the same sort of deceptive packaging the picture on the side of the box shows what most of us would consider a normal sized cookie but when you open the box you find that it mostly contains a plastic tray holding cookies about the size of a quarter i really want to like this company they seem to be trying hard and coming out with new products and keeping allergens out of the production process that is why i ve continued to try their products i bought their granola many times always wanting to like it but it is some of the worst food i ve ever had the clusters are hard as the partially popped kernels at the bottom of your bag of popcorn and more fitting for gerbils than people all in all i would not recommend enjoy life foods
negative,30/6/21,i have recently stopped eating a number of allergens dairy soy nuts and these were one of the few snacks which fit into my dietary restrictions unfortunately these were pretty gross miserable texture and more cardboard flavored than berry i threw them away i would recommend the cocoa ones as they are much tastier and also allergen free
negative,1/3/21,my daughter had extensive food allergies as an infant toddler and we bought these bars consistently she still has the nut and egg allergy so i like that i can trust the manufacturer and know the food is safe unfortnately the last few times we have purchased the bars all varieties they have been hard as a rock and my daughter won t eat them i have tried them myself and thought i might break a tooth i had them on subscribe and save which i have now cancelled and have several boxes which no one in my family will eat i agree with a previous post i want to love these bars and i love everything the company stands for and actually really like their cookies but something has changed with these bars and they are just not even appetizing i hope they address the issue and i will certainly try them again if they do something to enhance the taste and address the issue with the texture a total bummer they were better in the past but something changed with the taste along with their new packaging
negative,29/1/21,refer to the picture i posted above the bar is half the size you think it is going to be it is literally a two bite bar very deceptive advertising that and the fact that they are ridiculously expensive is the reason for the one star my year old son ate one and didn t like them i ate one and agreed as did my husband couldn t give it away everyone has different tastes but these are no tasty treat as far as i m concerned
negative,17/4/21,imagine taking some kids playground chalk perhaps that tan colored one and grinding it into powder with plenty of chunks then scoop it up and put it in your mouth that s how disgusting this bar is i have no idea how and who is rating this as flavorful it has none i ve done nutritional coaching for years and watched healthy foods progress from painfully bad to barely edible to excellent this neanderthal era gluten free bar is so bad i want to go to my local grocery store take all the boxes off off the shelf and hide them in a different part of the store perhaps if there s a trash compactor just to protect people from the experience my daughter had with this product save your money for these ridiculously expensive and spend it on anything else enjoy life bars being ill is better than putting this garbage in your mouth
negative,10/3/21,the first ball worked pretty well it just looked a little beaten up since then half of these have fallen to pieces in hot water all of them do after sitting for a bit if you don t mind the rate of failure the tea itself is pretty good and fairly tolerant of being steeped for a long time especially considering that it is white tea
negative,30/5/21,wow i am shocked to find clear plastic pieces in the jars the other posters say they notified earth s best about this in august and they are still selling it without checking or recalling no more earth s best for my little guy i am taking my business elsewhere and i am very sad that organic company is selling baby food with plastic and bpa in their jars they got to do better than this to get my business
negative,28/9/21,i normally love earth s best products as does my son however tonight after i d given him half the jar i thought i would try some since it was a new flavor and i realized that there were little pieces or soft shredded plastic in it i was appalled as this is my first child and i don t have any experience with this kind of thing i called poison control they said he would be ok and once i knew he was fine i got really angry i looked it up online and found that earth s best has actually known about the plastic for some time but are still selling it don t buy earth s best really disappointing
negative,6/5/21,only three jars came in a form edible to babies the rest of them were filled will a clump of spongy mush that would not mix with the water it also had a brown color and not the yellowish brown like the jars that had the good mixture pretty disappointing and a waste of money
negative,20/4/21,to be fair only one of my twins got gas from this but it was horrible up all night screaming from gas pains garbanzo beans are not an ideal food for young babies
negative,20/4/21,i usually make my baby s food it s so easy steam fruits veggies and puree but sometimes i don t have enough time to cook and i buy earth s best baby foods baby likes all the fruits and veggies so far but didn t like this one she refused to eat it when i tried it i understood why i wouldn t eat it myself either it tastes nasty my poor baby immediately i made her a homemade potato zucchini asparagus puree and she loved it i wouldn t recommend this flavor
negative,21/4/21,this is my daughter s most favorite baby food by far this is the only ones she ll eat and rarely will eat the other kinds however the taste is very bland for me as an adult at least after you put the unfinished portion in the fridge it may become sort of watery at which point i throw it out it is unique from the others in the combination of vegetables it has especially zucchini i had to update my review today because i saw little pieces of thin stretchy plastic in two jars of this baby food plastic in baby food i notified earth s best about it and will be sending them these pieces of plastic for testing but i am not giving my baby this food any more even though she likes it that s it for us
negative,2/5/21,i just wanted to post here that i found small bits of plastic in this food as i was feeding my month old plastic in food baby food so please be careful if you buy this or are considering it my daughter loves this food it s actually her favorite this is the first time we have noticed plastic in it in over months
negative,25/5/21,i don t know whether it was a fault in the packaging or if they were just past their prime but they were rock hard and the flavor was not strong enough
negative,7/9/21,this was a disappointment i use other products from this line manufacturer on a regular basis i bought this item as a convenience to carry liquid stevia in my purse the first time i went to use it the liquid was a dark color almost black and i had to throw out the latte i was trying to sweeten all the manufacturer s other liquid products are clear and in fact this is titled clear liquid it must have been outdated spoiled i had already thrown the packing out so don t know how it was dated i tried calling the amazon supplier but the call rolled into voice mail it s not enough money to spend time following up but it was disappointing
negative,25/5/21,i ordered these lollipops for a friends wizard of oz themed shower the arrived packaged well but i noticed the box said they re from oriental trading company if i wanted a cheap product that i knew was low quality and from china then i would have bought them directly from their site at for of them however from the picture these looked well made the picture is very deceiving and so is the description they show same colored lollipops mine came in a variety of colors they also gave dimentions that the lollipops were x i noticed they looked a bit small and when i measured they didn t even come to long not any of them even though they re all differnet lengths this was very disappointing since i planned to stand them up in a vase of lemon drops overall i m very disappointed in this product and the seller for not being honest about the product they re providing to consumers
negative,22/5/21,i purchased these to give to children who come to my place of business when they arrived it says clearly on the back of the individual wrapper made in china no way i m giving these to children if they were manufactured in china following the whole poisoned pet food debacle the fact that these are made in china needs to be highlighted much more clearly
negative,19/7/21,i purchased these for my candy buffet at my wedding and i m not impressed at all i could have saved money by ordering them directly from oriental trading company which is clearly where they came from they look cheap and they re not as colorful as shown in the picture the oriental trading company information is on the back of the wrappers on the lollipops most of the lollipop sticks are bent and two lollipops arrived broken the box only has lollipops but in the description it says there s i would have expected that if i knew they were coming from oriental trading company but that s not in the description so i feel ripped off
negative,7/9/21,these lollipops are not as pictured they came in assorted colors some really drab not the rainbow brights shown in the picture they are also completely flat rather than being the rolled old fashioned candy style so they look cheap i need them for a birthday party and i was really disappointed when i received them
negative,25/8/21,i opened this product to find that the lollipops were all broke i was very disappointed they did not package this product in a way that would help keep it from breaking you are better off buying them from a store around your area
negative,6/9/21,not happy with the product once they were cooked the potatoes were flat and didn t look any thing like the product picture that was seen the shipping cost as much as the potatoes did
negative,25/5/21,loose prickly pear tea makes a great iced tea but it is very difficult to find in pure form this tea is black tea with prickly pear flavor the shipping cost is twice the cost of the tea if there is a prickly pear component it is all but undetectable when i drink it it just tastes like regular black tea very disappointing
negative,7/9/21,so disappointed with this frosting the first time i used this frosting i was disappointed but a year has gone by and i thought that maybe i had gotten a bad container i really should have thought twice about buying it again but i wanted to give pillsbury the benefit of the doubt boy was i wrong in doing that both times that i used it the frosting pretty much sagged off of the cake my cakes were definitely cooled i had even put the latest one in the freezer to slice into layers after thawing it in the fridge i began to ice it sure enough after putting the frosting on it just started to slide off of the cake again this product needs to either be marketed as cupcake frosting the recipe needs tweaked or it needs to be pulled off of the shelves all together shame on me for trying it a second time
negative,13/10/21,i remember well the beer nuts i used to savor those were the days of the big redskin type peanut surrounded with a glaze of honey sweetness punctuated with a salty tang i remember so well these nuts i now have in the palm of my hand are not reminiscent of beer nuts in any way yes there is a discernible salty taste but the sweetness is more to me imagined than real plus these nuts are simply the common inexpensive spanish peanuts in short i would just ask beer nuts what happened
negative,2/10/21,the flavor of the old beer nuts is almost entirely gone the beer nuts are now just plain spanish peanuts with a slight flavor hardly noticeable extremely disappointing
negative,23/9/21,it is not the best way to buy beer nuts perhaps the product had been exposed to high heat and a whole lot of shaking most of the coating and flavoring was off of the nuts even though the individual cans are sealed it is like the nuts had been sitting out in a bowl for a long time on a hot humid day
negative,26/6/21,the current product certified organic raw cacao powder from ecuador sold by saaqin is of terrible quality somehow reviews for a similar item produced by alive and aware were associated with this product the cocoa i received when ordering through this page is made by organic herbal essence alive and aware is delicious organic herbal essence is not another warning after receiving the lb bag of organic herbal essence and hating it i ordered alive and aware certified organic raw cacao powder from ecuador pounds shipped by halaleveryday i thought for sure i d get alive and aware given it s in the product title but halaleveryday actually shipped me organic herbal essence grr
negative,25/5/21,as another reviewer stated many of the reviews for this product are actually for a different raw cacao powder from alive and aware ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder that is what i ordered about months ago and it was awesome i am almost out and when i went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product from saquin which is not what i ordered and it is more expensive the same base price but i got it with free shipping not bucks so that is a big price increase i know it was still from alive and aware mid february but recently something changed i am really confused irritated how my review for alive and aware raw cacao got switched to a different brand from a different seller i mean can t they just say out of stock or currently unavailable like they do with other stuff why would they switch reviews around seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one especially since as the other reviewer stated they are not comparable and this stuff from saquin is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware also the price increase is pretty shocking i guess it is the market and raw cacao is in higher demand too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao i did recently order alive and aware s raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those they are as the description states from alive and aware not another brand frankly i am beginning to wonder about some of the brands and vendors that ship from amazon i know they have warehouses in different parts of the country but it is a little suspicious and i just wish there was more transparency about what comes from amazon and what comes from a different company seems like halal everyday alive and aware etc are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday saquin are these really different companies under the auspices of amazon or is it amazon by a different name only like the other reviewer said he ordered something that said alive and aware in the description and when it came it was from saquin halal everyday who knows i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon for now i am going to seek out another source not through amazon that stands behind their cacao it is very important to me for health benefits and the ecological social impacts of where it is harvested to know that i am getting top notch certified organic raw cacao if amazon is going to be so wishy washy and sneaky i m going elsewhere wagging finger at amazon i think for now i will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back heavens to besty this stuff rocks it is such a good value too maybe the best out there as i have def shopped around i have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder and this is certainly top notch kudos to alive and aware for offering it at such a reasonable price i am not a raw foodie per say but i try to follow a neo paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao properly prepared with just enough natural sweetener i think this is a truly guilt free pleasure it is loaded with antioxidants as you probably know so go ahead get the big bag you can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food of the gods theobroma as they say my favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa i just whisk it into gently heated fresh raw whole milk or cream so it s not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible i know it s not raw but hey this is how i love it add just enough sweetener i like sorghum molasses a scant t spoon a bit of maca powder a dash of real salt and after that s thoroughly whisked i top it off with a spoonful of evo coconut oil yumm i have converted everyone even the kids i babysit who used to prefer swiss miss or i make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk lightly sweetened you better believe it goes fast i love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins a d and the x factor read weston a price and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry i am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy also process it with evo coconut oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil i often toss in soaked dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars just process in batches so it s kind of homogenous like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw go for it buy this huge bag share the goodness and you ll be healthier and happier for it i guarantee peace be with you
negative,7/9/21,ya know when you re on a gluten free diet you yearn for those forbidden treats like licorice and malted milk realizing that true licorice on this challenging diet is in the past and not likely to ever be repeated in the near future we need to alter our expectations for this treat i had tried this company s raspberry laces and strawberry laces pretty good although not easy to chew think bubblegum not real licorice you understand but pretty doggone good as an alternative so i thought i try these too how bad could they be i found them pleasant to chew not tough at all but the taste nasty and medicinal cough syrup with an aftertaste that is truly awful so i m stuck with packs see if you can t find a source where you can buy just one pack to try out your tastes may be different than mine and you might enjoy them
negative,15/7/21,i bought this pack to have some inexpensive caviar to use for garnish over the holidays the other night i decided to go ahead and use one for some dip it was so bad i couldn t believe it it wasn t spoiled it just had an odd flavor with a terrible aftertaste it didn t even taste like caviar i threw the jar away
negative,3/6/21,i would never have ordered this had i known i was only going to be sent and one of them was open and leaking powdered spice out i complained to amazon and i know from experience that they always have awesome customer service since i just got my package today and just opened it now i have to wait a bit to hear back from them on this issue will keep you updated i just wanted you guys to know that even though it states packets it is not must be a misprint double check with amazon before you order this what sounds like an awesome deal is a meh deal if you are getting only of them
negative,27/9/21,i found this product doing a search for edible gold leaf i decided to purchase after reading rave reviews about food items that were created using it however it is clearly marked not to be consumed and for decorative use only so this is a misleading product
negative,19/6/21,me and my wife have tried a wide range of the hormel compleats and this is by far the worst tasting one of the bunch i could complain about the lack of chicken but the horrid taste even overshadows that minor drawback i know its a cheap meal but i do expect something at least a little edible if you are looking to the compleats then go with something at least worth you money pick up the far superior tasting spaghetti or turkey dinners and feed this thing to the family dog
negative,25/5/21,this is a starchy soup rather than the meal portrayed on the outside there is very little taste and very little chicken it is mostly rice in a weak chicken stock thickened with potato and corn starch it is not repulsively bad if you want a light convenient snack the chef boyardee microwavable meals are tastier and more substantial and also more convenient because you just have to pull off the lid which comes away easily with these hormel compleats you have to pierce the top first and then peel it off afterwards which is not so easy especially as it is hot
negative,7/9/21,the taste isn t good at least isn t good for japanese and chinese its taste is basically sort of american japanese taste plus the price isn t competitive i d suggest asians never buy it
negative,3/8/21,i read the reviews for this product and had high hopes for a healthy decent tasting cup of noodles needless to say i found this not to be true first the consistency is gross and second the taste is awful maybe i am just not accustomed to eating crap think twice before ordering this product i wish i did
negative,5/9/21,i have purchased locally many other flavors of da vinci syrups and ordered blueberry online to try it because it is not available locally and i love blueberry well this was a disappointment to me very very sugary sweet with little blueberry flavor not to mention i paid x what i would pay locally very disappointed
negative,25/5/21,i tried the martha white turtle fudge chocolate chip cookie recipe and these are the worst cookies i have ever made either there is someone on the staff of martha white who has a lopsided sense of humor or their taste buds have taken a permanent vacation i wasted my time a lot of money on chocolate and pecans and my effort martha white either needs to tweek this recipe or take it off the website so no other unsuspecting housewife will waste her money and time on these worthless cookies my husband picked up one on his way through the kitchen and within two seconds he came back in and threw it in the garbage
negative,7/9/21,i simply don t like it it is easy to prepare but when i eat it i feel that i am eatting a lot of artificial ingredients i cannot even finish one fourth of it
negative,11/9/21,we enjoy a taste of tai s peanut noodles they rock that peanutty flavor mmm so we decided to try these um ginger not so much nothing really distinguishes these from any other noodle flavor and the ginger is a bit overpowering take this review in stride though if you re a ginger lover and i m not talking gilligan s island here then these may be right up your alley just a bit outside for me though if i may mix my metaphors
negative,13/7/21,i had recently tried a similar product from trader joe s and not having a tj s around me presently i decided to try this more readily available variation i didn t really like this thing too much for starters there is too much packaging for my liking too many things to throw away and i agree with a previous reviewer that they re kind of big cartons for how much they hold inside the container are packages one for noodles and three for various seasonings then you have to add water they give you a fill line but it s kind of awkward then microwave for minutes then stir then microwave again for one minute the one from trader joe s only has two packets one for noodles one for sauce and no water involved just microwave for minutes and you re done and those are a lot tastier i didn t like the texture of this thing everything clumped together too much and it really didn t have much taste especially considering the three different packets of seasoning i put in time to try a couple of the other brands of these things
negative,22/7/21,i bought these for my son to take to work for lunch apparently his co workers found the smell so offensive they asked him not to eat it at work again maybe it was a bad batch
negative,22/6/21,i had high hopes when i ordered this tea as years ago in san francisco i used to buy a lovely rose black in chinatown which was my favorite tea ever unfortunately this blend lacks body and is very high in caffeine i prefer the opposite a full bodied tea i can brew strong without sending my blood pressure through the roof but for someone who wants a light tasting tea with a powerful caffeine punch this might be a good choice
negative,28/7/21,i was giving my shihtzu the fromm adult gold dog food she didn t seem to want to eat it though so i thought i would try something different i found the harmony farms and thought i d give it a try she actually liked it it s cheaper then the other food and it seemed to contain really healthy ingredients i couldn t believe how she gobbled this up but after having her on this for a week she developed a rash on her stomach took her off and the rash went away completely in days her hair also wasn t as soft this kibble did not do well for her
negative,13/10/21,i read the reviews on this and thought id get some for my dog and pup they will not touch it even if i mix it with home cooked food they like the dollar store dog food better than this amazon let me down on even allowing this dog food to be sold under their name
negative,19/2/21,i bought these and tried each flavor i could not even finish any bag but the barbecue i really liked the barbecue but all the other flavors were gross and the texture is really like fingernails on a chalk board to me how is this the best selling item amazed anywho to each his own godbless and enjoy but if you are like me and enjoy barbecue just get the barbecue kind
negative,14/12/20,very tasty chips original and other flavors but ones with salt flavor way too salty not sure who likes so much salt in chips
negative,14/12/20,i hate to type this because there are so many people that really enjoy this product but take a look at the ingredients in this so called all natural product i have the cheddar cheese flavor right in front of me so that is the only flavor i can vouch for right now about halfway down the list of ingredients you ll see yeast extract unfortunately this is the new message many people are still unaware of this fact and natural food companies are taking advantage it is a chemical flavor enhancer whose potential side effects are very scary google message yeast extract for yourself or check out
negative,19/2/21,these are to potato chips as pringles are to chips as instant coffee is to brewed coffee and stephen baldwin is to alec baldwin same family but scant resemblance so i d buy a single small package at your grocers and try them out not for everyone and certainly not for my family which includes two teenage boys even they take a pass on these unless they are truly desperate crispness is ok even mouth feel is good but there is a lingering not good taste again kind of like pringles ps the flavors are ok but definitely taste like they were made at that flavor factory along the jersey turnpike
negative,10/1/21,purchased the oz bag seemed the same size as the other bags when purchased but didn t realize it was ounces as compared to other bags just be aware might be perfect for some but not for us having a bag with potato chips in it doesn t cut it for me might be perfect for kids but just a heads up
negative,26/3/21,i don t know why everyone loves these chips they are healthy but taste disgusting only the original flavor tasted good so getting the variety pack was a very bad idea i would not buy this again and would rather go with baked chips than these pirate s booty makes popped chips that are way better
negative,24/3/21,despite the plethora of positive product reviews for these snacks i see no reason to buy them again read those positive reviews and compare the content in some of them to the guidelines of a non profit consumer organization for reviews they contain a lot of wow with little specifics that would have been included by a true believer weigh the others as you will but the proof is still in the pudding the texture is their best asset if you like that sort of texture that s about it for me they appear to be an extruded potato product many of those out there with various seasonings that do not impress me either the most basic of them puts mg of sodium into the tiny oz package if you were a deer you might eat them for that alone the fat is reduced that much is true but unless you are ready to trade fat for sodium it s no deal but wait baked kettle chips in a oz serving up the fat to g the same as the of the basic flavor you got oz free on that one the baked kettles possess mg sodium vs these chips give you g fiber in vs in oz of baked kettles this product loses again the only place you might gain is in carbs for the kettle chips for these but remember you have oz extra in the kettle s nutrition info just about a wash and then topping it all the cost an oz vs for baked kettles in subscription wow these wonderful snacks cost per pound packed as they are the prices will fluctuate but think about the things you can buy for that money instead these are microscopic bags that does not help the environment either portion control aside with product largely deriving its kick from sodium and cheap spices the most positive thing i can say is the product is packed very well lots of air in the bags to protect the chips and they will mostly arrive intact in their tiny portions in tiny bags you won t have many crumbs in the bottoms of these little bags so that is a good thing but bottom line expensive junk health food wow
negative,24/2/21,i decided to give these a try since one of my good friends and her son raved about how good they were bad idea i almost ordered two since they were such a good price i am so glad i didn t we don t care of these at all the concept is nice chips that are crunchy and better for you than most but they taste funny they have a funny aftertaste and are not that enjoyable we have been slowly and i mean very slowly making our way through the the box brought we still have left and we received them over two weeks ago so they are not so horrible that you can t eat them its just like forcing us to eat them so we don t have to throw them all away if you haven t had them before i suggest trying them before committing to bags of various yucky flavors
negative,19/2/21,i love shrimp chips and i love healthier alternatives as well so i thought these would be a match made in heaven not so much the flavors were too strong most of the time i am a huge fan of pepper but even i had a hard time enjoying the salt pepper flavor and the salt and vinegar made me shudder with each bite because of how strong the vinegar flavor is and this is from someone who currently lives in the uk and enjoys all types of vinegar crisps here and too bleh in others the only flavors that my husband and i both liked were the bbq and sour cream and onion and we didn t enjoy them enough to want to buy these again i wish these were as good as all the hoopla regarding them said but we still have bags of these in our cabinet four months later uneaten so needless to say i will be giving these away and avoiding them from now on
negative,14/12/20,i bought those chips after reading good reviews but i was very disappointed with the taste it was nothing like what i expected granted that i expected good old kettle cooked potato chips i bought the flavor variety pack and there were many flavors i did not care for it was worth trying them but i am not going to purchase them again in the future
negative,19/10/21,the best flavor in this box is the salt and pepper and the bbq flavor all the other flavor was just so so
negative,18/5/21,i was at a charity fund raising event where they were handing these out they seemed pretty tasty so i bought a couple bags at target the ones i bought barbeque and salt and vinegar were awful i ended up throwing away most of them neither i nor anyone else who tried them could choke them down the ones they were handing out as samples were clearly very different from what they are selling don t waste your money
negative,19/2/21,the only flavor we could stand was the barbecue which was the reason we purchased them in the first place i had to give the others away i won t be buying this again for lunches although the size packaging was great i just wish the other flavors tasted better plain salt pepper etc weren t really kid friendly
negative,14/12/20,these chips taste so dry and gross i would rather eat carrots or something than these they just didn t satisfy the salty craving and weren t worth the calories
negative,1/6/21,i bought this because i had been seeing this pod in magazines and other places i thought it would be a great addition to my fridge to save money on cilantro however this is very poorly designed i could not open it what is or ever even after searching through reviews after reviews finally my genius boyfriend found the solution basically you will need to open it from the bottom you will need to squeeze the two sides next to the cap in order to open it you will have to be careful when you are opening or closing it while there s water in the pot if any one who is reading this still having problem opening it let me know i ll try to explain it better there but anyway this is a pretty useless product for its productivity but a bit more useful if you are too lazy to make your own and wants a prettier fridge you can make you own with a cup or any container filled with a bit of water and wrapped in plastic bag with the herb so unless you have money to waste don t buy this useless pot
negative,1/4/21,i have had the herb pods for about months they are a great concept but have a poor design the plastic cover is very hard to take off and snap back on i m constantly afraid that i m going to break it the pods do keep herbs fresh for several weeks in the fridge as long as you replace the water unfortunately i don t use them half of the time i buys herbs because they are more trouble than they are worth
negative,15/4/21,with no clear instructions on how to open and close the unit the first few times are an act of frustration when i finally realized that if i grip with my thumb and forefinger over the clear plastic shield about one third from it s bottom and squeeze the sides the bottom lip pops out nicely i will agree that this size is too small for most popular herbs like parsley basil ect the company does now make a larger unit and it looks like it is more user friendly all in all i like it i took away one star for the lack of instructions after a few months i have thrown this thing away it became increasingly harder to open and the size was just too small for the herbs i use most i have seen some newer larger units that don t have the issue with opening it like this one has i m going to order one of these i no longer recommend this unit and have lowered it to stars
negative,19/5/21,despite reading the reviews of others on how hard this was to open i was confident i knew the secret so would be fine not so no matter what i did couldn t pop off the clear plastic lid instructions showed the bottom part screwing off didn t husband couldn t even do it and he opens everything for me he finally got it open only held about half of the aspargus which is what i wanted it for so tossed it in the garbage and then bought one from progresso that we both can open note to self pay more attention to what people are saying
negative,19/2/21,even with the tips shared on how to open it it s still pretty difficult to open i guess i have weak hands my husband usually has to open it for me and even he doesn t do it with ease i would recommend getting the larger prepara herb savor instead of the pod it s much easier to open and can hold more i could hardly fit any cilantro in the pod considering that the grocery sells them in such large bunches and i only use half
negative,14/12/20,saw this on oprah s favorite things and thought it would make a great little christmas gift for my friends that love cooking as much as i do since they come in packages of three i kept one and gave two away i couldn t open mine to clean it so my husband had to open it and he had a hard time i thought it was just too tight from the factory my basil looked great after ten days but when i went to use the basil i could not open the pod husband not home neighbor not home dog missing thumbs i tried lightly rapping it against the counter edge and the seam cracked right down the middle okay maybe a little harder than lightly i was pretty frustrated luckily i had emptied the water so i only had a small mess to clean up the pod went into the garbage forcefully i checked with my friends friend had the same problem and her pod is now a rooting capsule for plant clippings because she had to throw away the clear cover it also broke when she squeezed the pod to try to open it friend has now been warned there were no special tips included on how to open the pod and judging from comments i ve read we re not the only ones who have had this problem i think this was designed by the same guy that invented the security wrapping tape on music cds i ve gone back to my old method a wide mouth mayo jar with pretty hair band holdingdown a circle of fabric it works
negative,28/7/21,i ve been told that the refrigerator of the future will have herb vegetable salad bins inside to grow vegetables and i thought the prepara herb savor pod looked like the perfect precursor wrong the detachable bottom comes loose continually and leaks water everywhere similarly the plastic plug at the back does not hold a good idea a nice looking product but poorly executed refrain from purchasing plastic bags are much much better
negative,29/6/21,the prepara herb savor pod is advertised holding asparagus that was why i purchased it thinking it would be good for keeping asparagus fresh in reality the pod will hold very few spears and they would need to be quite thin and short the ad is misleading i ll keep it for storing herbs but asparagus is out of the question
negative,15/10/21,after reading a previous review i carefully inspected the cans when they arrived the cans were immaculate and very clean so i felt relieved after cooling in the fridge i ate the first can the fruit was very mushy and not attractive to look at and frankly a disapointment but did not taste rotten per say only minutes later though my mouth felt like acid was eating at it and was very painful for hours even after washing out my mouth i eat much canned and fresh fruit and this was a first for me only days later my teeth and gums were infected and i had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad he found infection and i had to undergo a treatment of antibiotics and painkillers before i was finally ok again after about weeks sheesh needless to say i threw out the remaining cans of fruit the problem must be at the source as the cans and packaging were st rate and shining clean quality control must really suck i m all for natural but great care must be taken so contamination is avoided this is a foreign product and their health standards may be lacking there i would stay far away from this stuff if you value your health
negative,20/7/21,edit i just noticed each bag is only pounds not my review is not stars instead of three first off as you can probably guess by the pictures these are sour gummies that isn t said in the description also each one is about to inches in length and inch wide texture and flavor the came to me soft and with the same texture as most gummies such as peach rings the sourness is average not overwhelming but not too little where i took off the stars was the flavor most important part as i chewed them a few different flavors hit my tongue none of which tasted that great i couldn t make out any of them in particular not good at that anyways but the combination was just plain strange i could see myself getting through one bag but will probably give the other away to nephews niece after all they will eat anything sugar coated right
negative,12/10/21,i purchased this item because it was cheaper than other olive juices i was looking for a good quality olive juice for martinis i was pretty disappointed the juice is very strong i followed the instructions and put the ratio on the bottle into the shaker and made a martini the ratio was part vodka to part olive juice it was way too salty the olive juice was over powering i made a decent dirty martini with parts vodka part olive juice i would not recommend this item
negative,19/2/21,ordered this a few months ago only to find it is just basically lactic acid read the ingredients the main label says olive juice by no such thing i am going to suggest that amazon take this off the website
negative,14/12/20,this product is simply for cheap liquor since taste and quality is not important i prefer to drink my grey goose straight however on occasion it is absolutely delicious with a very tiny splash of olive juice this product was a a quick fix for me to stop purchasing olives in order to use the juice it s not worth it the after taste is worse
negative,2/7/21,sea salt is more easily administered with a salt mill this is just a salt shaker that delivers uncontrollable amounts of sea salt and anti caking agent into your food and no iodide the anti caking agent isn t event that effective so the salt either comes out in clumps or gets stuck at the exit stay away
negative,11/3/21,this candy tasted like sugar without much rose flavor at all i ended up throwing most of it out because i don t like so much sugar i prefer strong flavors like altoids twin pack mints wintergreen tins the center of the candy does have a licorice flavor because it s an anise seed but there are better licorice candies out there like twizzlers twists black licorice pound bags pack of
negative,10/4/21,my husband just bought a keurig coffe maker in the box was samples his favorite was donut shop i ordered the k cup for him i was so disappointed out of the k cups were decaf giving me k cups of each of the flavors i also ordered the wolfgang puck sampler i got flavors each how cool is that i would order donut shop again just not the sampler
negative,22/7/19,i ve used cento san marzano dop certified tomatoes many times in the past and was always pleased with the quality of these great tomatoes that said this is the st time i ve ordered this item from amazon and all cans arrived completely dented and banged up terrible presentation for an expensive item as an aside none of the cans i received has a dop certified label but only certified and no serial on the side of the cans so i m not sure if these tomatoes are actually dop certified or not
negative,2/2/20,the can that is shown says d o p certified but when my relative ordered them from amazon com the cans that were shipped only indicate certified one can buy these non dop at any walmart what do they mean by certified certified as to what unfortunately the venders are making fools of amazon com as a consequence i am staying away from cento products entirely fool me and amazon once shame on cento fool me and amazon twice shame on me and amazon there is no way i can make this review fun
negative,2/2/20,these are not dop they re just certified which means nothing significant they should go a step further with a little more nonsense and write department certified real dop tomatoes are much better
negative,31/8/19,they tomatoes are certified san marzano but not dop like the item shows in picture i called amazon and they sent me another box of for free to fix issue the new shipment was still certified not dop so please know this tomatoes are ok but not the best fyi
negative,22/7/19,i purchased a case of these tomatoes a couple of months ago and the cans were so badly bent and warped my can opener won t open them i complained to amazon and they shipped another case out right away but those cans are worse than the first case i won t order again
negative,12/1/20,the product image is misleading the image has the tomatoes as d o p certified but the tomatoes i received are not
negative,19/2/20,merchandise was not damaged during shipment but supplier send me damaged and incorrect merchandise of the cans were badly dented and the cans they shipped were not dop certified they sent me lower standard merchandise received full refund from amazzon
negative,27/11/19,of the cans shipped of them had very very serious dents in them i m not talking dings i talking serious dents so dented that i truly thought of throwing them away my husband stopped me though because at a can he felt that it was too wasteful in my local grocery store items this dented are put into a reduced price bin because they usually don t move otherwise cento san marzano certified tomatoes ounce cans pack of
negative,12/12/19,it s a shame to use so much corn syrup for babies i m very disappointed when i noticed that the same kind sold in china is even better
negative,26/9/20,do you really want to be feeding your baby a bottle of corn syrup i used this until i realized that i switched to gerber its so much better for your baby
negative,22/7/19,i decided to try this formula for my baby since he started being very gassy however this formula made him more gassy the formula is very thick and produces a lot of bubbles that gets fed to the baby i tried to make the formula with anticipation to let the bubbles disolve but that didn t work
negative,2/2/20,if your newborn cries inconsolably you should try a lactose free formula right away even though they re so expensive however the ingredients may not look so good it s important to shop around if you re going to use a lactose free formula lactose free formulas always are the most expensive and this one is loaded with processed corn syrup solids from wikipedia baby colic also known as infant colic three month colic infantile colic and colic is a condition in which an otherwise healthy baby cries or screams frequently and for extended periods without any discernible reason you ll know it if it happens to your baby and it s awful to not be able to do anything to immediately relieve your baby it contains dha ara and iron but all baby formulas do because it is required by law lactose free formula is expensive is because it goes through a very specialized and difficult manufacturing process i m told by the company s public relations representative so much food in the you s is prepared with corn syrup solids so that shouldn t be a worry i m told ok but i notice the obesity rate is high
negative,23/5/20,the description of this product is disceptive this product was represented as a powder but it is not a powder it s a granule it is nothing more than shredded coconut and doesn t even dissolve in a high speed commercial blender unless you are using this product to manufacture a dark chocolate coated coconut patty to me it is useless my intention was to use it as an additive in a healthy shake it ended up ruining the shake as i had to resort to chewing the undissolved tasteless coconut pieces rather than drinking the shake additionally the way the product was packaged there was no protective cardboard preventing the slashing the top package when the box was opened if i could have rated this product zero stars i would have the only redeeming quality was that it was rather inexpensive i gave one package away for free to a patient who loves coconut and she gave it back to me two days later complaining that it was terrible
negative,22/11/20,i bought this same brand from an online indian grocery store that usually has excellent products i was able to turn it into cream butter using my super blender and adding some water but it barely had any flavor i usually buy the chao kah brand of coconut cream which is quite tasty and flavorful and read another review for a different product for making your own coconut cream my complaint is not the shreds or texture mine was just virtually tasteless
negative,30/3/20,i bought this for our young son and was disappointed in several aspects of this dispenser it s made of cheap plastic and arrived w the globe scratched and cracked the top doesn t screw on it just pops off w very little exertion part of the appeal for me was that this dispenser is coin operated what the description on amazon doesn t tell you however is that a coin is not necessary to dispense the candy furthermore when the crank is just barely turned the candy usually two pieces flies out so quickly that some goes on the floor w o your hand there to catch it a young child is often not coordinated enough to turn the crank and put his hand out to catch the candy the dispenser only came w enough candy to just fill the bottom of the globe it is very much over priced at
negative,8/7/20,i was disappointed when i received this dispenser it said a large dispenser it looks like something for a child to play with i bought it for my husband to put in his man cave he is a huge m m fan i buy him a tree ornament each year from the m m collections i was hoping it had more substance to it i also did not realize i was unable to return this item
negative,4/1/20,i found this muffin to be dry and very disappointing if i cut it up and put it in a bowl with yogurt it was ok would not order this flavor again
negative,30/1/21,the picture shown is for three packages and the price is fair for three but i was only sent one but was charged for three also the item sent was not the item shown i can buy the item shipped all day long at any local grocery store i went to amazon because i was looking for the type shown when i contacted the seller and told them about this they said they would give me partial credit for the item but nothing for shipping seeing as how i was shipped something i didn t order i should be entitled to a full refund including shipping i was not offered that if i could give this seller negative stars i would any future buyers beware
negative,2/11/20,too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest
negative,17/10/20,the treats were ok my main complaint is they were small about the size of a lifesaver which made it hard to give them to my medium size dog as a treat one treat just di not do it this package should be labeled for toy or small dogs
negative,22/7/19,i bought bottles of this tart cherry juice because they were cheaper than tart is smart they may be providing the anti oxidents that they say but they completely failed me in helping to sleep better at night i returned bottle to amazon went back to tart is smart i used to wake up times a night have trouble getting back to sleep being nearly retired i can sleep in if i choose with my it is formula i get to sleep fairly quick wake up hours later get anothert hour or two after visiting the bathroom this product may work much better for you but i found one that works for me will stick with it forever i hope to read your opinion of this product soon
negative,2/2/20,i ordered this item in a large quanity but wanted the items packaged as shown they were for favors in a holiday bag for the company employees when they arrived a few were packaged as shown but the bulk were loose if i had know they would come like this i would have gone to costo or some other discount store for the purchase the cute little box that would have helped make them special and what i thought i paid for was missing
negative,4/10/20,if you are ordering cookies beware the cookies arrived in crumbles so if you want a box of stale crumbs order away
negative,1/4/20,two of aunt gussie s cookies contain of daily fat allowance the cookies are so full of grease they fall apart they may be sugar free and gluten free but they make it up with mostly fat i can t even give them to my grandchildren
negative,8/5/20,carabou mahogony is the worst tasting cup of coffee i have ever had and i ve been drinking coffee for over decades it tastes just like a piece of burnt toast the only way i can make it palatable is to put it over ice add lots of vanilla sugar syrup and milk i ve got to find some way to justify the purchase and icing it seems to help
negative,18/6/20,if you like strong coffee as i do this coffee is over rated i found it weak with a sickening after taste
negative,20/8/20,honestly i m not sure why so many folks like this coffee in their reviews it s a little weak but mostly just doesn t have a rich flavor it is really missing something i drink coffee black maybe it tastes better with cream and sugar before buying this coffee i had been drinking starbuck s french roast and folger s black silk both of which taste so much better than this coffee
negative,1/6/21,please contact the manufacturer and ask them to change back to the old formula if you love this product we just cancelled our subscription of cases per month because the new formula is disgusting not buying again unless the change back to the old version
negative,4/7/21,ugh i tried this as a replacement for the coconut water with pineapple that was available before in the automatic ship program this stuff is awful it s got added sugar which is not needed at all and actually makes the drink taste pretty gross never getting this stuff again and i do love coconut water in general as it is a fantastic hydrator and tastier than gatorade well usually not this stuff
negative,5/2/20,almost gagged at first taste i have used other coconut based products water milk cooking oil etc and this is the first time i have been disappointed my teenage kids hated it my son is health food nut and drinks all the protein shakes and he couldn t stand it i am sure done is not the healthiest but one you try that there is no comparison in flavor tolerance
negative,22/7/19,i ve had amy and brians coconut water yum vico s plain in the tetra pack great the ones in the plastic bottle and some in the larger tetra packs are from concentrate blah and yuck don t get those and the ones in the glass bottles green cover can t remember the name but pure coconut water great too this one with pineapple no good the added cane juice is superfluous to the natural sweetness of coconut water and pineapple juice it makes the water taste thicker and not so healthy i wish these brands can just stick to the name of the drinks in their ingredients i e coconut water and pineapple juice no more
negative,2/2/20,i love coconut and pineapple but i was not wild about the one coconut water with a splash of pineapple it wasn t bad it had a mildly coconutty though not sweet flavor but it just wasn t anything special it was rather bland and i had a hard time finishing it as it started to warm up since i m not a competitive athlete and don t have any great need to replenish my electrolytes i d rather just drink water
negative,22/11/20,this product is billed as an all natural anti oxident and electrolyte replacing beverage sort of like all natural gatorade with anti oxidents like a sports beverage it too is also kind of bland i love some of the gatorade flavors some not so much this drink falls into the not so much category for me it is sorta sweet sorta pineapple y and also sorta bland my wife commented that it has a slippery feel in her mouth like the glass had soap in it still i didn t think it was that bad but the drink really didn t appeal to me in the end yes this drink is probably much better for you than a glass of apple juice and definitely better than some sugar infused punch but as a sports drink i think i ll stick with plain old gatorade it s cheaper and contains fewer calories per serving if going the all natural route with your juices drinks is of the utmost importance this may be something to consider and bump this review to stars
negative,1/3/20,i received a single once container of one coconut water with a splash of pineapple as part of the amazon vine program for review it would have been nice if it had come with a straw especially considering the price of the product now as to the splash of pineapple well it must not have been a very big splash because i never did taste any pineapple so what did i taste it is hard to describe it doesn t taste like coconut or cane sugar or any natural fruit flavor to be honest it tastes like water sort of like water with an odd undefinable extra flavor it s not a bad flavor or a good flavor it s just meh flavor i don t care how healthy this drink is supposed to be for it s price it should have a better flavor or just have a flavor and as a thirst quencher it doesn t equal up to gatorade or even a lemonade i feel a glass of tap water would do just as good as job to quench your thirst
negative,23/11/20,coconut water with a hint of pineapple shipped to the us from indonesia packaged in usually non recyclable disposable containers and catering to the sports drink market good source of electrolytes i took a ounce container and poured servings for teenagers and adults first impression the teens serious athletes were not told what the drink was but i did mention that it was being marketed as a potential sports drink the result no negative votes but no one would choose it over existing drinks everyone recognized the pineapple flavor instantly it leaves a strange feeling in my mouth one teen said this was probably the coconut water it had a residual flavor and feel there was no straw included with the package so the opening and pouring needed the assistance of a fork or knife it s mostly cane sugar water so why bother but the biggest issue is the waste coconut sugar water from indonesia what s the carbon footprint of this product and the container has recycle symbols on it but like milk cartons it is difficult to find a community that will actually keep them out of the landfill bottom line it s not that tasty being little more than sugar water and the transport and packaging waste really don t fit into a culture for me focusing on sustainability
negative,5/4/21,sojo s diet lacks calcium and if fed as directed will because severe metabolic bone disease in your dog this diet requires supplementation with a balanced calcium phosphorous additive to be safe
negative,27/4/20,this paste is actually what first got me into thai curry at the time i loved it made it all the time then i discovered a better brand of curry paste hand brand curry paste premium stuff amazon doesn t sell hint to amazon stock it but you can get it at its based in seattle and they import everything from thailand the flavor of hands brand is so much better the mae ploy a huge difference i went back to mae ploy after having hand brand and i did not even finish my meal very bland boring by comparison also as a side note these are very small containers i was used to buy the large ones at my local asian store these are like the size of those ones not a good deal if you can find it locally
negative,8/3/21,there s one important thing not mentioned on their label and that it is not for use in containers why hide that info to make more sales of course you ll only learn that if you read their q a on their website i studied the labels and opened the back label and it s never mentioned you can t use it on potted plants thanks bayer now i have to go back to the store to return it i guess a lot of people have wondered why their potted flowers or roses died not knowing it s because of this product if you see your bees dwindle and disappear then this is the reason will systemic products affect your fragrance of your flowers after years of use they will not have a fragrance got earthworms you wouldn t know unless you thoroughly dug through your dirt avoid this
negative,30/1/20,if i could give this product a minus stars i would there is now very strong evidence that chlothianidin which is in this product is one of the pesticides that is affecting honeybees and contributing to colony collapse disorder this us has yet to ban this pesticide but it has already been banned in other countries avoid this product and any others containing clothianidin
negative,22/7/19,it is ok soup but i expected more as i love lobster bisque and tried so many different kinds in different places this one is very watery and i could not find any lobster there i guess it is ok for the price but i would never buy this brand of the lobster bisque again
negative,2/2/20,i gave this product a one because zero wasn t an option this is like a can of generic tomato soup with some overcooked bits of fish scraps in it the only lobster in the soup was some she will it was salty fishy nasty and inedible not only that but of the cans were dented a complete waste of money beyond disappointing it made me angry
negative,2/9/20,saw this soup in the supermarket and bought a can opened can heated soup tasted soup dumped soup down drain rinsed mouth with mouthwash enough said
negative,26/1/21,as far as canned soups go this is ok i was disappointed with the texture extra unexpected bits she will pieces and overall quality having been spoiled by living in maine for years before relocating to the south i tried different brands of canned bisque i have come to the realization that lobster bisque is best when made fresh
negative,9/1/21,i wasn t thrilled because i had to pick out tiny bits of gravel the flax seeds themselves were fine top quality if it weren t for the gravel bits that get through the sieve w the seeds i guess this would get stars
negative,30/7/21,i m a little shocked that this so called health food product is made from chinese grown ingredients i d be curious to see what the carbon footprint of each bite is also keep in mind that chinese ingredients and products have been found to have all kinds of contaminants such as lead in toys and melamine in milk and other exported food products all the ingredients in this snack are widely available in the united states why not support products and companies who source locally and consider our own economy before we sell out for a slightly cheaper price your purchasing choice does make a difference let s stop expecting corporations and governments to take care of our safety and economy they never will we can change the way these companies do business for the benefit of our long term health and economical well being make purchase decisions wisely
negative,30/10/20,mrs may s should inform their customers where exactly their products are made and take a stand i won t be buying any more of her products until further notice no matter how yummy they are do no harm and quality control is a concept not understood in china totally frightening what they re getting away with
negative,3/8/20,i used to like this product until i learned that it is made in china how many more horror stories do we need to hear about such atrocities as lead in baby toys made in china contaminated baby formula made in china contaminated tooth paste made in china and poisoned pet food before we learn that if it comes from china it should not go in your mouth your baby s mouth or your pet s mouth
negative,29/1/21,i expected the flavor to be more like that of brewed green tea it really does taste like dried green tea leaves simply dissolved in water although i m sure this is probably a good way to get a concentrated amount of antioxidants i wouldn t order this again
negative,24/10/21,as others have said this is really mild in flavor the instructions call for packet per oz of water there are packets per box i decided to give it a try as i am basically lazy and wanted some unsweetened unlemoned iced tea that i could make on a moment s whim i started with packet per oz of water then packets per oz of water and got some flavor now i m using packets per oz of water i placed a fairly large order so i could experiment with it and have it throughout the fall and winter since i m using triple the amount of product in order to get some flavor i will probably not order this item again
negative,24/10/21,i wanted desperately to love or even like this drink mix but am not having success doing so i love mint tea but this tastes all green tea to me it s too strong a green and too weak a mint flavor for me to enjoy it every once in a while i ll try to tolerate a bottle again hoping i change my taste it s not gross and so clearly is appealing to some people
negative,16/10/21,the tea was very weak and not that good now i have six boxes of tea i that no one in my family likes
negative,24/10/21,i bought this tea as i like blueberries and stash is known as making good teas however when i first emptied the drink mix in the water the color was an odd green not very appetizing once i mixed the powder with water the resulting tea had no real flavor i feel like i wasted my money and can t get a refund
negative,25/9/21,this tea was horrible it tasted like potpourri i have really enjoyed other davidson s teas many also containing flowers and thought to try something new i think the last ingredient is where things went bad it was natural flavor which must have been rose oil or something since my tea chemical taste and making a weaker tea did not help at all
negative,19/10/21,i ordered this because amazon recommended it to go along with the redenbacker popcorn popper i got from them hey only a few of these actually pop most of these small unpopped kernels get thrown out of the popper what an absolute waste of money
negative,20/10/21,we opened a can of bar harbor clam chowder and could not believe how few clams were in the chowder there were mostly potatoes
negative,19/10/21,well when i bought this item i thought it would be a direct japan import it is taiwanese it was bought at costco and resold the price label was still the product the product can be bought at costco for half the price if not less the expiration date was not printed on the product which makes me think it was expired i believe this as most of the mochi is dry and tough will shy away from this product
negative,15/6/21,this comes in a case of so i bought one can locally before ordering the large amount good move i have cats and none of them would eat it this review is for the mature gourmet beef entree haven t tried the other favors yet
negative,4/8/21,i feed hills science diet to my pet because i love him and the vet tells me i should but in all honesty this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap lock reseal that i have ever encountered it is painfully difficult to get it to close properly and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product packaging is important it is no better for your pet to live on stale oxidized food than it would be for you oxidized fats are also called rancid if you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human well you get the idea this is about more than just inconvenience i am posting this review for all the hills science diet products with this kind of packaging if you have had the same experience as me with this product please take the time to let this company know about it i love my animal i want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him but this quite literally the worst reseal that i have ever had the misfortune to encounter theo
negative,4/8/21,this review will make me sound really stupid but whatever i don t really care as long as people find out what s real and can avoid my mistakes i got my wonderful little sweet bella bean when she was a few days shy of three years old she had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap i have had cats around me my entire life for about twenty five years now my mother always just fed them whatever the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket friskies nine lives kit kaboodle stuff like that and our cats were always fine at least in terms of their eating habits they would eat in the morning stop when they were done come back and eat some more when they got hungry my housemate at the time was working for hill s and assured me that this was the best food ever made so great so on and so forth i now know that she is an utter buffoon but i initially trusted her judgment which is so unfortunate because she doesn t think she also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags which made it a much more attractive choice i first tried feeding the little bean an unmeasured amount of science diet in a bowl but that didn t work as she would devour it in one sitting so then i took to measuring it and she did the same thing then i started parsing it out to twice a day that didn t work either because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day running around intentionally destroying things deliberately spilling her water crying etc until she got more food so then i split it into three servings same thing then it got to be four servings that was a little better but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times so then it went back to three all the while i was trying to reduce the amount of food i was feeding her to less than of a cup because she was a little chubby reducing was hell she became even more hungry but i figured she would get used to it not really for over a year she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way knocking things off my desk ripping up any paper she could find scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief as soon as she got food she was back to her sweet self but only for three or four hours we thought she was bored we thought she was a little nutty and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder she always wanted food it was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad a few weeks back we took her to a new good non money factory vet for her second checkup since i ve had her i talked with him about her being always hungry he asked what she ate and i told him the adult indoor science diet without saying as much he basically told me that this food is garbage and i should look for something else he said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients science diet does in a very loose by product kind of way ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it healthy instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning not that i care about spending money on the bean but this food is way too expensive for what it is so we began transitioning her onto wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago she is still eating percent science diet with percent wellness you really shouldn t just give a cat different food one day out of the blue but she never freaks out anymore it s amazing and it s percent because she is eating real food now along with that sawdust and chicken hearts i still regrettable have to feed her we have her down to eating twice a day only cup in total she was eating three times a day of a cup in total now she eats some in the morning walks away eats some more a few hours later and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding no more knocking things over no more trashing dad s papers on the desk no more howling no more deliberately spilled water on the floor it s incredible i feel so bad that i was doing this to her for so long we really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever but no she was genuinely hungry because she wasn t eating any real food do your cat a favor buy her or him so food made with real ingredients things you would eat wellness halo innova evo whatever figure it out for yourself but please don t feed your cat this it s garbage
negative,18/7/21,we have five cats one an elderly cat of years the other four in the year range the oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease his numbers didn t warrant being on prescription food yet but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food because we have five cats and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats since we made the switch weeks ago all of the cats have gained weight this was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight not good for the rest of them our other male went from a slightly chunky lbs to an obese lbs almost three pounds in weeks the females gained between to pounds each we noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl like they couldn t seem to get full we also saw a lessening of coat quality lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly including with a furminator and one developed bad dandruff the stools developed a really bad odor although i do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which i am grateful for most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened i am very disgusted with science diet they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags one of the sites i researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available if you compare the various science diet formulae that have different health claims on them the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive with other brands such as innova or royal canin there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae now to deal with the weight gain as well as the other problems we noted we are switching foods again this time we are trying royal canin indoor mature wish us luck
negative,18/10/21,although this seems like a great product it is definitely not minced the cans say it is minced but it isn t it is ground beef my cat only likes minced not chunks not ground although she will eat ground cat food sometimes it has to be inviting and delicious yet she just walks away from this i hate it when the packaging lies about the contents of a product the shipping was speedy and the value is great as long as they deliver what the promise now i am stuck with food my cat will not eat at all
negative,15/6/21,i made the mistake of believing that science diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use after doing some research i realized that science diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or iams i would not recommend any of these options the main ingredients are chicken by product and corn here are some interesting facts cat s can t digest corn in fact they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition when i fed my cat the science diet he ate all the time constantly after switching him over to castor and pollux indoor cat formula he eats much less now also by product means just that beaks feathers toe nail clippings meat not suitable for human consumption dead animals etc totally not worth the it s cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself doesn t sound so appealing does it science diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find don t let your vet fool you either vets usually get a cut from hill s to sell you their cat food my recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research try brands like newmans own or castor and pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record i later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals science diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers a requirement is to exclusively feed science diet to the animals try this instead castor pollux ultramix indoor feline fomula dry cat food pound bag
negative,4/8/21,i did not know anything about chutney until i went on a known recipe cite and found out that they mix the fruit with peppers and vinegar i thought chutney was a different form of marmalade but i was wrong
negative,8/6/21,i received this box with great anticipation since they don t sell these on the west coast i got the package opened the box and was extremely disappointed the cookies looked like a gorilla shook the box to death and left most of the box filled with crumbs and there was a rodent sized hole on the side of the box so needless to say i will not not be reordering these again
negative,15/6/21,i made cupcakes with the vanilla cake mix they were just ok they were dense but not overly so so that wasn t too bad the flavor however is where i was disappointed the vanilla flavor was so subtle that i missed it entirely and i felt like there needed to be a little more sweetness which probably would have also made them a bit more moist the child i made them for only ate a few bites
negative,4/8/21,i tried vanilla cake mix and pizza crust mix and was disappoined in both they had a medicinal bitter taste and even smelled strange i threw both items away
negative,25/9/21,the chocolate cake is fantastic so i had reason to think that this would be as well not the case it was very dense tasteless totally unlike the airy tasty chocolate i want my money back or an even exchange for the chocolate cake mix
negative,19/10/21,i was expecting these cookies were going to be normal size but i was wrong i was planning on dipping them in chocolates but they r not those average size at all so disappointed i now have to go out n find the normal size cookies what a waste of money i also needed but of them were broken they do not put fragile on the box outside
negative,4/9/21,reading in earlier reviews that these were genuine chinese fortunes i served them with a chinese christmas dinner and was greatly disappointed as were my guests three sample fortunes are life is not a struggle it s a wiggle management is doing things right leadership is doing the right things if you re feeling down try throwing yourself into your work these are not fortunes they are self help mini bites a fortune is your love of travel will soon be satisfied and it doesn t matter if they are predictive or not what matters is that they state a fortune beware the dog in the corner house would be fun to get life is a wiggle is boring the cookies arrived on schedule as promised and in good condition in their individual wrappers all of that was as i d hoped but content counts in fortune cookies especially
negative,31/8/21,i love these cookies they taste exactly like oreos but unfortunately every time i eat them cookies at a time i get horrible headaches and migraines which i don t get from real oreos its obviously caused by some of the nutritious ingredients another thumbs down they include vitamin k which should not be eaten by anyone on blood thinners or for anyone middle aged or older who overindulges in these cookies be warned vitamin k can because blood clots headache migraine sufferers beware of these cookies
negative,9/10/21,i ve had many types of pepper jelly and this is by far the worst ever the price is high and the taste is not good the shipping was outrageous more costly than the green pepper jelly don t waste you money
negative,15/6/21,i m a big fan of hodgson mill products we love their bread mixes i use their pancake mixes i m not afraid of whole grains i mill my own grains wheat kamut rye barley and i even put milled flax seed in my home made yogurt i ve been a baker for years and love to try new recipes i had high expectations for this product but was very disappointed by the results the box calls for too much fat and the baked brownies have a distinctly oily feel in the mouth i can enjoy the grittiness and the chocolate flavor is fine but i would caution buyers against the results if following the instructions on the box one of the problems is that the coarse texture of the mix does not allow the fat to be absorbed well i will go back to making whole wheat brownies from scratch a little bit of time required a little less convenient but brownies being a treat and comfort food the texture should be right
negative,4/8/21,first off i love whole wheat products and flax seed so i hope we just got a bad batch and no it wasn t expired i checked the date but my mom and i just had some of these and we re not fans they had an oddly fishy grassy taste to it kind of like you might get with rancid flax oil tablets o o
negative,15/6/21,i have made potato bread before with great results but this hodgson bread mix is way too dry it needs some more moisture don t buy it unless you want really dry bread
negative,4/8/21,white bread is not my thing so that s probably why i don t like this one i like herby white breads and really full bodied white breads but otherwise i always choose whole grains this one is not full bodied and has no particular flavor not interesting at all to me
negative,15/6/21,i ve been eating snow s clam chowder for years so i buy a few cans when it s on sale well it looks like bumble bee has taken over what a big mistake when i opened the can it was all watery and smelled funny i put it in a bowl to microwave and noticed how thin it was but thought i d try it anyway it was nasty to say the least it about made me sick so i went and opened another of the new cans more of the same then i got an older can of the non bumble bee chowder and it was great like always if i could give the new junk no stars i would sucks bad
negative,4/8/21,looks like and tastes like chocolate colored water no chocolate flavor whatsoever this was a complete disappointment i got the hot chocolate k cups from swiss miss instead how people can be giving this product four and five stars is astounding to me is the amazon ratings system being gamed for this product
negative,1/10/21,when i bought my keurig brewer i eagerly looked for other beverage options for my wife who is not a coffee drinker i m still looking the grove square hot cocoa had a nasty aftertaste almost metallic no amount of cleaning tinkering with the brewer made any improvement i used the brewer to make hot water for a nestle hot cocoa pack and that was a far superior beverage the grove square quickly found it s way to the trash i ll find quality mixes and use the keurig to heat the water from now on
negative,1/7/18,since i am willing to try alot of new things i thought that i would buy this product and since i do like hot cocoa i bought boxes worst thing i could have done this is bland with very little flavour it also has a grainy texture near the bottom of the mug personally i will not buy this product again i will stay with swiss miss or another hot cocoa brand for the keurig k cup
negative,10/8/18,just plain nasty this item tasted like cardboard very watered down and no flavor to it at all very disappointed
negative,1/7/18,thin runny and the fake milk powder used to add creaminess has an off flavor better off eating your ceramic mug
negative,10/8/18,i don t expect great hot chocolate from a k cup but it should at least taste like there s some cocoa in it i can t believe how bad this stuff tastes i tried it times and then threw the rest away
negative,13/9/18,i wish i had listened to the other bad reviews the artificial sweetener taste is awful i gave two stars only because my husband doesn t seem to mind i can t drink this even if they were a bargain
negative,17/7/18,so bad i returned it my children didn t even like it and they are not difficult to please when it comes to sweet drinks or food
negative,16/1/19,the artificial sweetener ruined this for me it leaves the fake sugar taste in your mouth and my husband who drinks diet soda even noticed at least it wasn t pricey
negative,16/1/18,i tried to find the ingredients for this hot cocoa before i bought it but couldn t find anything online turns out it has one of those mile long ingredient lists and yet that didn t help the taste at all it is awful i had three boxes of the stuff sitting around for a month and couldn t find any takers i finally got rid it of it at the christmas white elephant gift exchange at work i put it with a nice cookbook which was the real present and wrapped it real prettily unfortunately the boss ended up with it i haven t asked him if his family enjoyed it because i don t want to put him on the spot judging by the reviews there are a lot of people who like it hopefully he will too maybe it just depends on how your taste buds are trained mine grew up with hot chocolate made on the stove with milk cocoa and sugar and maybe a tiny pinch of salt compared to that this stuff tastes like a chemical experiment anyway instead of trying one of the other brands i now heat some milk in the microwave stir in a couple spoonfuls of hershey s cocoa and some sugar to taste it takes about three minutes and it s delicious now where did i put those mini marshmallows
negative,16/1/19,well you get what you paid for while this milk chocolate k cup is pretty cheap per cents per count but it is not good it tasted like watered down chocolate as if you put in too much water and not enough milk or chocolate cacao for that matter this thing is sweet though in fact kind of too sweet for my taste i am beginning to think half of the powdery content is sugar sweetener i thought it was the amount of water that made it taste watered down so i lowered the cup size from ounce to ounce on my keurig brewer and it s the same thing
negative,1/8/20,this is much too watery it tastes very much like the tasteless hot cocoa one gets out of a vending machine after receiving the box and reading the list of ingredients i ve decided not to order again this product if definitely not worth the money
negative,1/7/18,with green mountain hot cocoa being perpetually out of stock in the winter i thought i d give the cheaper grove square brand a shot since the k cup patents are starting to sunset grove square is one of the first unofficial producers of we can t legally call these k cups but they work in your keurig r tm coffee maker pods and i thought that i d be getting the same overall quality without the licensing fees tacked on to the price well i was right about grove square being cheaper but i think that s the nicest i can be as others have pointed out there s a definite diet or splenda aftertaste this hadn t been reviewed yet when i bought it so i didn t see the warnings from others and re checked the ingredients several times to make sure well it s got calories which seems a bit lower than green mountain but a bit high for something that diet conscious people would want and the ingredient list didn t seem to point to obvious diet sweeteners the overall taste is kind of like someone dropped a sugar free tootsie roll in your hot water using the normal cup setting going one size down didn t seem to improve much beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter but that just meant a heavier shot of low calorie sweetener to the taste buds the way i see it i saved about by going with this brand on the other hand now i ve got of these cups left that are probably going in the trash if i can t sucker someone er please my discerning guests with a few cups if you drink diet soft drinks by choice you re probably going to like this
negative,10/8/18,this tastes terrible like putting aritficial sweetener in already sweet hot chocolate the best i have tried so far is swiss miss hot chocolate k cups don t think they are sold on amazon yet
negative,15/2/20,my whole family people tasted all flavors and they are sickly sweet very disappointed that product has sucralose i wouldn t buy it again
negative,22/4/21,using oz water as the directions state made the cocoa much too weak it was like hot water with a few drops of chocolate syrup using oz made the cocoa much too sweet and still too weak in the chocolate department it uses sucralose as a sweetener which gives it a very intensely sweet flavor this may not be a problem for those who like very sweet things or don t mind the taste of sucralose unfortunately i m not one of those people
negative,25/9/20,can t tell you how this tastes because i read the ingredients first but it has trans fats in every flavor the seller should disclose all ingredients in the description i wouldn t have purchased this otherwise
negative,16/11/19,i received my order of grove square hot cocoa mix today and was very shocked to see that hydrogenated oil was one of the ingredients in the mix i have avoided using any products that contains trans fats because of the negative effects on blood lipid levels i would urge amazon to require an itemized list of ingredients for all food items listed for sale if the ingredients had been listed those of us who have concerns about our health can avoid these products
negative,9/9/20,this does not taste like cocoa it is very weak no matter what cup size you use i is just not good
negative,1/7/18,when i got my keurig i fell in love i bought a bunch of different sample packs and two boxes of the grove square hot cocoa i m a bit of a hot cocoa nut partially because i can t have caffeine and partially because it brings back wonderful memories of playing in the snow and the fun of warming up afterwards i really wanted to love this hot cocoa i tried all three flavors multiple times in different ways i tried them on the different cup sizes adding things etc there s just this strange taste to them that doesn t sit well on the tongue i m not sure what it is but it has a faint ring of sour milk it really lingers and i haven t found anything that takes the taste away i m going to give my second box to a friend she doesn t seem to notice it my daughter and husband both said it tasted weird so it s not just me i also took it to a friend s house and have tried them in three different keurig machines just to make sure mine didn t need to be descaled so i guess my suggestion is to try it before you go for the multiple boxes
negative,10/8/18,this has to be without a doubt the worst tasting hot chocolate ever the best way to describe the taste of this stuff is really cheap suger free instant hot chocolate swiss miss instant is way better and cost less after only cups threw the rest in the garbage where it belongs and canceled my subscribe and save for this slop
negative,15/1/20,i guess there is a reason that the ingredient section on this page doesn t mention that the first ingredient is trans fat partially hydrogenated oil had i know i would not have purchased this consumers need to vote with their dollars and avoid buying items where the manufacturer is using cheap and unhealthy ingredients
negative,1/9/20,please stay away from artificial sweetners some of them actually change the shape of human cells this has an artificial sweetner
negative,22/7/21,i ordered the dark hot cocoa in hopes it would be real chocolatey and it was no better than buying a pouch of hot chocolate and adding it to hot water i actually think the pouch added to hot water is loads better and a whole lot cheaper v e r y d i a p p o i n t e d for the price it s a rip off
negative,1/7/18,i can t believe i didn t check out the ingredients for this i never would have bought it if i would have known there was artificial sweetener in it first cup though i got that weird after taste it gives and that was all she wrote if you don t have a problem with a chemical taste or concerns about health problems you may like it not worth it to us
negative,10/8/18,found my kids actually cutting open the pods and dumping them into a cup to add hot water too they complained that lots of the good stuff stays in the pod kind of defeats the purpose of the packaging so we switched back to packets
negative,14/5/21,we prefer the swiss miss brand k cup this one was watery in both milk and dark chocolate this is my least favorite of all k cup brands
negative,17/10/19,we bought both brands to try and found this one with much less chocolate taste then cafe escapes dark chocolate it was also thinner in consistency won t buy again
negative,3/10/21,we bought this to replace our cafe escapes dark chocolate cocoa they are less expensive but you get what you pay for this cocoa is watery brown sugar water with an aftertaste i do not recommend it grove square hot cocoa cups dark single serve cup for keurig k cup brewers count
negative,15/9/20,i love hot chocolate and was very excited to find a variety pack however these are gross horrible after taste my kids do not even like them now i have boxes of the stuff that no one will drink very disapointed
negative,30/8/20,i was very excited to get some hot chocolate cups for my keurig and even happier there was a variety pack i read the reviews and even there were some negative ones i went with it anyways i tried the milk chocolate it has such a weird taste to it but i gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried another later that night same weird aftertaste i asked my husband to try it to make sure my taste buds weren t off he commented that it had a hot plastic y aftertaste to it not even worth drinking too bad i have more cups that will go to waste
negative,1/7/18,as a hot chocolate lover i was verrrrry disappointed when i tried this product i first had the peppermint disgusting and then tried the dark chocolate a little better the problem is that you can really taste the artifical sweetener i am a diet soda drinker so i don t have a problem with artifical sweetener it s just that the taste was so strong in these hot chocolates that it overpowered the chocolate taste i definitely will not buy again i would not recommend these to anyone
negative,10/8/18,i m an avid hot chocolate drinker and this is just doesn t measure up it reminds me of the sugar free swiss miss no matter what size you set your cup on it s just missing that cocoa flavor maybe the dark chocolate would be better i personally like the cafe escapes milk chocolate better i bought a pack and then i was able to find it at my local grocery store so i bought another one now i m stuck with the pack
negative,5/12/19,ingredients sugar glucose syrup solids coca processed with alkali partially hydrogenated vegetable oil may contain coconut soybean sunflower palm and or canola nonfat dry milk modified whey maltodextrin salt natural and artificial flavors cellulose gum sodium caseinate cornstarch lactose dipotassium phosphate sucralose mono and diglycerides silicon dioxide soy lecithin artificial color contains milk and soy people please read labels
negative,21/10/19,i bought this to include in my daughter s party bag it worked so well with the circus theme that we had unfortunately the cracker jacks were stale when i heard this the first time i thought no way can t be but then someone else told me the same thing and then i heard it again from someone else really disappointing i am so embarrassed
negative,8/9/20,arrives postage due in a used friendly s box unfriendly don t you think worst service ever totally unfriendly aweful aweful aweful service
negative,22/9/21,ordered this and most of the boxes were stale and stuck together checked the expiration date and it wasn t expired starting to think they just changed the expiration date and shipped everything that went bad
negative,2/10/20,i don t know the deal is here but they are terrible i love cracker jacks and not just because there is a prize especially now that the prizes are pointless compared to what you use to get these arrived and the first box i ate seemed very stale checked the date and was not expired and the date was a long ways away so i figured maybe it was that box but i m a few boxes in now and they are all the same it s like chewing on cardboard i event went to the local to get some to compare and those at were timex better since it was so cheap to get them it s not worth the hassle to send them back so i think i ll just give them out for halloween
negative,25/7/20,cracker jacks were horrible stale not crunchy and tasted awful even though the expiration date on the package had not expired
negative,4/7/21,becareful if you plan to use these more then two months after you order them they expire quick i can t use these i ordered them to use in my november wedding but they expire in march
negative,11/9/21,original description and order said assorted chocolates what i got weeks later was one pack of all white chocolates the least desirable not worth the bother of returning even with prime might be better just buying at local store same or cheaper price when you can see what you get
negative,4/7/21,these look like typical sugar plum jellies but they are actually grape flavored you would assume that they would have a sugar plum flavor they taste like cheap kool aid and not the yummy jelly belly ones i can t seem to find on amazon
negative,21/9/21,they decided to ship both my order in one huge box of cans instead of green beans in one box corn in another and i was barely able to get this inside my house then every single can of green beans was dented and cans of corn were dented
negative,11/9/21,the purchase and receipt of the box of chocolates was very good and made my home in plenty of time for christmas the box was opened the day after new years the cholocates were discolored and dry the box had expired two months before i made the order i made a complaint with amazon which was resolved in a few days with full credit to my charge card this company wanted me to mail them back the chocolates which i had saved along with the wrapper they would not reply back to my inquiry as to who would pay for the shipping the chocolates back to the seller i still have the out of date and bad box of cholocate and will keep them for inspection for the next month or so then trash can
negative,12/10/21,what more can i say barley edible crunch on sugar did come on time but have a feeling that they wanted this unloaded because it didn t sell or maybe bad batch doesn t make you sick or anything like that but you can actually find yourself crunching on sugar like you put a sugar cube in your mouth kids probably don t care hope this helps
negative,11/10/21,the box has only pasta and dried up sauce no tuna if you can see the words in the spoon on the bottom right of the box it says just add tuna so the products is making a false claim shame on you annie
negative,28/9/21,instead of a resealable tub with the jelly beans i received a cardboard box with a plastic bag full of jelly beans they were closed with a twist tie and there was no labeling on the bag on the box there was a typed label that said green apple jelly belly oz new there was no ingredient list company logo allergen information or anything else you d expect to find on food packages i certainly wouldn t eat food that arrived in a plastic bag with a twist tie i did ask that it be shipped next day so maybe they couldn t take the time to package it in the advertised tub amazon was nice enough to give me a full refund which was the only positive part of the experience
negative,19/10/21,i bought this for fathers day my father loves dried fruits and nuts it came in a somewhat cute crate box and each compartment was in a plastic bag that means that if you don t eat the nuts in one sitting they will go stale as they are now sitting in the open same story for the fruit while all the bags were closed when my father opened them he found that the nuts were stale and the fruit were hard chewy i recommend purchasing this if you need a centerpiece but not if you actually want to eat it
negative,4/7/21,i have to say that i really wanted to like these muffins but i could not they have a really bitter after taste whether this is attributable to the gluten free nature of the product i do not know the hodgson mill blueberry muffin mix is a far better choice on a positive note they do raise very nicely but it is unfortunate that i find them barely edible and have five more boxes of the mix left
negative,11/9/21,this product comes from a very good company that makes a number of excellent gluten free as well as non gluten free baking products do not let the poor quality of this one product keep you from trying other products they make this mix is a classic example of a very poorly designed and likely untested gluten free product it lacks enough sugar and moisture ingredients to make the finished product taste good and mix well as with many gluten free products new to the market you find yourself constantly adding something to try to make it right to these i had to add nearly a full cup of sugar to begin to dissipate the very bitter taste i added both applesauce and plain yogurt during different baking sessions to get a consistency that would feel and move like a muffin mix this mix takes too much doctoring to be recommended at all until hodgson mill goes back to the drawing board and fixes this but hodgson mill does have other good products try their blueberry muffin mix and hope that one day amazon will carry a wider array of their gluten free offerings as many are very very good
negative,12/9/21,i bought these at my local grocery store i wish i would have read the review on here first the positive is they do hold together well and look like a muffin the negative is they are so bitter i could barely finish my half i just recently found out i have celiac disease so i cannot have gluten i have never tried a gluten free muffin mix before so i can not compare it to any others i have tried the betty crocker gluten free brownie mix and that is wonderful so i do believe there would be a good muffin mix out there
negative,13/7/21,i was really excited and surprised when i found this mix in my local wal mart given it was a good price i figured id give it a shot before i whipped up a batch i figured id do a little investigating to see if there was any input suggestions on the mix wow is everyone using the same mix or what reviews from its great to its horrible like a total split soooooo before i wasted a bunch of money on products to whip up a batch and see for myself i figured id simply open the packae up and take a taste to the mix all on its own ummmmm yeah it totally has a pretty strong bitter after taste and like another reviewer i had figured this mix would be adequately sweet enough for me and not need any extra sweetener i do not like things very sweet at all but its def not as i re read the ingredients i realized there is not any sugar sweetener in this mix so you would def need to add sweetening but overall i do not even plan on taking this mix that far i am pretty certain that adding sugar will not take that aftertaste away that is an issue with the flour mix and no amount of sugar is going to make that go away id strongly suggest avoiding this mix i hope the company works on this mix it has good elements to it i like the fact you can determine how sweet you would want it and the apple pieces are pretty tasty and i think it could be really tasty
negative,23/10/21,if i could i would give it zero stars i am not a picky eater but this mix did not rise can you say hockey puck was extremely bitter and not sweet even with the recommended amount of sweetener added save your money
negative,22/9/21,i concur with previous reviewers in that these muffins have such a bitter taste i also bake often and i m certain it wasn t me my gluten eating husband didn t like them either they were also dense if you are looking for an apple cinnamon flavor and need a mix you might be better off using pamela s baking mix which is awesome and adding apples and cinnamon to it the muffin recipe is on the back of the pamela bag in conclusion i don t recommend these they were really disappointing
negative,4/7/21,i really didn t notice elmo on the package these are for kids more than adults nothing wrong with flavor but priced for kids that scream alot
negative,11/9/21,this hot cocoa is the nastiest tasting instant cocoa i ve ever had i know it s not going to taste like the real thing but after just three cups i can t bring myself to finishing the box i think i ll just throw them out our k cup machine is about a month old and the coffee flavors we ve tried are all fine so we wanted to try the cocoa the first try was very watery so i thought the cup size needs to be reduced this results in just a sweeter cup of hot water stick with coffee
negative,8/8/21,these were a little disappointing the hot chocolate is very watery and the flavor is a bit strange kind of plastic tasting haven t been able to find a good brand of hot chocolate for keurig
negative,9/7/21,after trying several of these k cups we threw the rest of the box away it only ever created flavorless brown water we then tried the grove square dark chocolate cocoa k cups and were much happier
negative,24/10/21,sure to be a hit with chalk a holics everywhere from first sip to last this product suggests its european heritage deep in the chalk mines of southern france some seem to be making a case for it only having calories but the keurig chai latte only has and that product actually tastes pretty good i have yet to find a keurig compatible hot chocolate that stands up to plain old swiss miss scooped from a tub or a foil packet and swiss miss isn t that great to begin with although it sure is cheaper than this stuff i wonder if the size of the keurig capsule limits the amount of cocoa and powdered milk that can be put into a cup so what ends up there has to be strong and highly compromised
negative,4/7/21,gross i tried these thinking they would at least taste like the regular powdered mixes the flavor is all fake sweetener odd since sucralose is the last ingredient and no dark chocolate i am bummed because now i have a box of these cups and don t want to drink them
negative,11/9/21,my son would rather have no cookie than one of these cookies the taste is okay the texture is hard and weird even when microwaved short shelf life if you are buying in bulk not absolutely terrible but worse than average try pamela s chocolate chip cookies they are wonderful or try a baking mix
negative,24/10/21,i went to check out and found out that the freight is on an canned not fresh produce ridiculous
negative,22/6/21,my husband didn t care for this coffee at all he complained it lacked flavor and aroma
negative,30/7/21,to make a decent cup of coffee i have to use two pods at a time i prefer a strong cup of coffee even if it is decaf what happened to senseo decaf
negative,10/7/21,this coffee melitta one one java pods breakfast blend coffee count pods pack of is terrible cheap beans bad roast whatever my lot actually tastes like it is moldy maybe i just got a bad batch i have tried the buzzworthy dark roast melitta pods and they are drinkable even though i prefer medium roast coffees suggest you try one box of these not the box lot i m stuck with also to help you evaluate this response better you should know that i like quality roast kenya aa or sumatra or columbian supremo etc rich flavor type coffees i don t like folgers maxwell house pedestrian type blends but even those are way better than this coffee
negative,4/7/21,i have a melitta one one machine and have been using juan valdez pods in it when i ran out i searched for pods for it only came up with these melitta brand ones i figured incorrectly that the others weren t available purchased these very disappointing my coffee had been nice strong tasty but coffee made with these is weak tasteless i bought a box package of three different types am now stuck with them forget these head to juan valdez same price range unless you like weak coffee
negative,11/9/21,i m flabbergasted by the glowing reviews that truffle oil is receiving on amazon those of you espousing a desire to drizzle this stuff on your food might be sorely disappointed to learn that the truffle flavor in those tiny bottles of truffle oil are made in a laboratory there s not a molecule of actual truffle in them it s a sinful shame that s perpetuated despite being outed a few years ago in an enlightening new york times article called hocus pocus and a beaker of truffles read it and weep and if you see truffle oil advertised on the menu somewhere you might ask if they re using any other artificial flavorings in their dishes
negative,20/9/21,i love the product but the bottle design is terrible in order to get the last or so of the body wash out of the bottle in a timely manner you would normally store the bottle upside down with the pointy top that is impossible so you must stand in the shower the try to shake the remaining product the length of the bottle to squirt it out this takes much more time that you ll want it to take redesign the bottle with a flat top please
negative,13/10/21,i will never understand the soaps from mainstream and sometimes otherwise great brands who claim to have a line of sensitive skin products which still contain sodium lauryl or laureth as in this case sulfate if you re someone who needs sensitive skin products there s a more than decent chance that you also need stuff without sls boo refer to their bar soap which is wonderful
negative,2/8/21,this product gave me a horrible rash it contains both soybean oil and fragrance which are allergens they need to list allergens
negative,11/6/21,i don t enjoy giving products a bad review but i was so disappointed i had to i ve tried quite a few teas and i ve been able to drink teas that others say taste like dirty dish water so i can get down some pretty harsh teas i usually don t use any type of sweeteners either because i drink my tea right before bed i ve tried to give this tea a chance i have tried it with sugar honey and lemon and masking the flavor with vanilla and a little milk to me this tea smells like dirty feet and probably tastes like them too i ve also tried straight chamomile teas before too so i know it s not that i would rather eat the plant itself than drink this tea i haven t tried any other twinings products so this review is strictly for this product
negative,2/8/21,it saddens me to say i had to return this item the item s page specifically said the calamares were packed in olive oil however on the actual boxes the ingrediant showed it was packed in another oil an unhealthy oil that was the bad news the good news is amazon as usual was gracious and professional in allowing me to return this item which is considered to be not returnable that is why i buy everything online from amazon com they are the best
negative,18/10/21,these bags never close well so if you are a compulsive bag closer forget about it ah the taste you ask dry and dusted with its own carnation in powderized form snack creators branching out by offering traditional products in slightly different forms results in me expressing negative comments via reviews and why oh why does everything have to be miniaturized in order to appeal to rugrats and the type of people who have to proclaim their brood with stick figure ish stickers on the back of their vehicle please just go straight for the original chips ahoy in standard size pig out and forget about the kids for six minutes
negative,23/7/21,when i eat junk food i d like to enjoy it the guilty pleasure it is these cookies are neither healthy or tasty stick to chewy chocolate chip cookies
negative,8/7/21,tastes pretty crappy it s like raw cookies it s not even like a cookie it s a squishy thing in a cookie shape
negative,11/6/21,i purchased these thinking they would just be ordinary oatmeal raisin cookies wrong i like chocolate chip and i like oatmeal raisin but these combination cookies just don t work well together i wish i had read the item listing more carefully even my kids said blech
negative,25/6/21,after eating tang s chocolate and double chocolate cookies all other cookies will taste like expired tepid dogfood to you her cookies will enhance your life in ways you never dreamed possible tim horton s timothy s second cup starbucks treats and those horrid packaged cookies at zupas are just pathetic imitators to the grandeur that is a tang cookie her cookies are da bomb a hawt damn
negative,2/8/21,overall i was not happy with the crumbiness of these cookies they were way to fragile and crumby there is just too many crumbs in my bed how am i supposed to sleep like this
negative,11/6/21,i bought these because i had decided i wanted to eat and even snack healthier these had so many good reviews so i decided to try them i admit it was a big mistake to order a whole stupid case without trying them first when i opened them they looked totally unappetizing and then i tasted them it tasted just like a rice cake styrofoam with salt on it they also have a very unusual texture the combination of taste and texture was very disappointing my teenage daughter tried them and felt the same way not even the dog would eat them we tried them with a variety of dips and couldn t come up with a tolerable way to choke them down luckily i have a niece that is newly vegetarian hungry all the time and she took these off my hands i am still out for buying the case of these to begin with what a waste
negative,9/7/21,just plug and play with your preferred software no hassles worked great for about months then just stopped working didn t drop it it is made of a flimsy plastic and is light as a feather feels cheap it just stopped working when i buy a product i don t just want it to work great for three months totally dissapointed
negative,22/6/21,i will admit the icicle does allow you to plug any mic with an xlr jack to your computer using a usb jack it does indeed provide phantom power to condenser mics and it will deliver a signal to your recording software beyond that the usefulness depends on your mic and what you consider an acceptable recording level i tried this with an akg blue encore and an akg all deliver very nice sound when used in a conventional recording chain i could barely get an audible record level yelling into the encore my staple for location voice recording normally i plug the encore directly into a digital audio recorder with an xlr cable no mic preamp no phantom power no eq and i get a good clean clear sound level near the peak of input level this is one very disappointing product if you route your mic through a preamp then put the icicle between the preamp and the usb input of your computer you can get a decent record level but that extra equipment is what this light weight gadget is supposed to avoid personally i think you might be better off getting a decent channel strip or mic preamp and an xlr to to mini jack to go between the channel strip and your computer input and forget the icicle altogether blue makes some great products but this is not one of their better ones for those that don t know channel strips combine several pieces of equipment into one box typically a mic preamp and a compressor higher end units add some eq capability as well or have other options
negative,2/8/21,i was told by the salesman at guitar center that the icicle was easy and very high quality it is perfectly easy but i have had nothing but problems from mine there is a constant popping in anything i record i am using an akg c b microphone i have had for a long time and it is in perfect condition so the problem is not with my mic anyone else having this problem haven t been in touch with tech support yet but i will say i am not happy with the icicle
negative,11/6/21,i find that even with the gain on maximum the volume is not very loud i use it with a shure sm mic and my macbook using audacity one must be very close to the mike and speak somewhat loudly when i use the shure mics with a mixer the analog way there are no volume problems it is simple to set up being almost plug and play you have to choose the input source
negative,8/7/21,the product was simply not recognized by my windows home premium computer very disappointed considering on the blue website it says that it is i gave this the extra star because i am sure its a great product but the lack of communication of the compatibly was very disappointing most likely will not be buying anything else from blue
negative,28/9/21,i had this product for literally only a week and had only used it one time when trying to use it again i found that it wasn t sending the sound through when i plug it into my pc it recognizes it and the icicle lights up and i select it as my recording device but then when i actually try to record it makes no sound at all and i have tried moving the gain knob around so it s not that this was a complete waste of money unless there s an easy fix that i m missing
negative,23/8/21,this does not work on windows tried reinstating software and to no surprise it din t work this was a waste of time and money be aware of this issue
negative,1/8/21,i have been using a standard xlr to usb cable with my shure dynamic mic which works okay except for an annoying hissing noise that accompanies the majority of my vocal recordings i bought the icicle in hopes of eliminating those noise issues when i received the icicle i couldn t wait to plug it in and take it for a test drive unfortunately right off i got an error unable to load drivers this is a plug and play device so there are no drivers to download and i knew something wasn t right after restarts and uninstalling the usb hubs and ports numerous times as suggested by icicle s troubleshooting website it was still a no go i went to icicle s website and logged a ticket explaining the issues in detail and that i was running windows the next day i received an email instructing me to send the icicle back as it has a defective driver amazon was great about sending a replacement while the return was on its way so i received the replacement icicle today pulled it out of its packaging and with bated breath plugged it in hoping for success no such luck the same error message came up about the drivers i decided to google my issue icicle compatibility with windows and bam it took me to a guitar center review of the icicle that clearly shows in the product specifications that it is not compatible with windows amazon needs to get on the ball and add this to their information it is nowhere in amazon s description and the icicle techs themselves didn t have a clue about it either i found this inadequacy with the blue mic technical team to be unacceptable they probably have non technical csrs pretending to be techs for all their troubleshooting that s one way to save a dime but please people if you re going to give us technical support then say so if it isn t really technical support then say it is customer service i am terribly disappointed that this device has not been upgraded to accommodate the newer technologies windows has been out for some time now there is no indication in the little mini booklet that comes in the icicle package that says windows is incompatible it only gives set up info for mac and windows does not show which os i am sending my icicle back to amazon for a refund and will need to look for something that will work with windows if you have a pc that was purchased in or later save yourself the hassle and don t bother with this product as your os will more than likely be windows
negative,16/7/21,picked one up to use with a laptop running windows home premium the computer saw the item but said it needed troubleshooting nothing worked after researching online i found that many people had run into this problem apparently the firmware is not compatible with windows it s supposedly been corrected in newer runs but there s no way to tell if the one you re purchasing is newer or not i tried contacting blue twice hoping to get a firmware update or check into exchanging it but never got a response from both attempts so i finally just had to return it
negative,2/8/21,purchased and it came looking new as i had bought it new but it was actually damaged customer service with the actual company is awful as i needed to contact the company itself to return it
negative,11/6/21,used it a couple of times over the course of a month and it worked great third time high pitched noise and no mic signal coming through not too surprising given how flimsy this thing feels this is apparently a known issue just look at other star reviews of this product nuff said
negative,26/6/21,i wanted to like this product as it would have been a fast and easy solution for many of my needs but it didn t work well at all very noisy lots of hissing and pops that are completely absent when using the same mics and computers with other adapter devices considering the decent reviews by others i may just have a defective unit either way it s going back in the mail today
negative,20/8/21,i used the icicle for about two hours after taking a break i plug it in and my laptop will not recognize it i did everything i could think of to fix this even hours of searching google nothing in the process of a return it would ve been perfect if it just worked
negative,25/8/21,it works reasonably well with condenser microphones with dynamics the hum exceeds the signal works with windows not with linux the build is very cheap anything more than for this is too much
negative,19/10/21,been gluten free for years now thought we were done with mixes that tasted awful we threw it away because we did not like it for my money you can t beat pamela s baking mix but the betty crocker chocolate chips are the best so don t give up betty crocker just work on this one
negative,2/8/21,i was hoping bisquick got it right when they released this product but they missed their mark i made both biscuits and dumplings chicken dumplings the biscuits came out okay but the flavor was bland the dumplings were fluffy but not very flavorful and turned hard after a day or two
negative,11/6/21,i love pancakes so giving up gluten was hard for me i ve used bisquick for pancakes for years with great results alas the best i got from the gluten free version was edible but not enjoyable it tasted a lot like pillow foam not in a good way i will probably keep the mix for breading things but not for pancakes i ve found much better options
negative,22/10/21,overall this mix is okay but the sugar content is very very high you can actually see the sugar in the mix if you look closely for pancakes or waffles this is fine but for savory concoctions this is not acceptable sausage balls casseroles and biscuits all come out almost inedible this mix is also oddly gritty the grit is very fine but still makes my teeth want to curl i recommend pamela s baking and pancake mix as it is smoother and much more versatile because it s not as sweet a good cook knows you can always add more of something but you can t take it out if you ve added too much that being said if you re traveling and this is the only mix they have it s better than nothing
negative,6/8/21,i made the waffles and was not impressed definitely not worth the expense it s only redeeming quality was that i seasoned it to bread oven fried pork chops i would rather have saved my money and made up a flour mix from scratch
negative,24/6/21,thought i had died and gone to heaven when i made the bisquit recipe i was wrong went to indigestion hell i had serious hope for this product i truley loved the mix but it didn t love me i haven t had indigestion since i gave up gluten until i ate a bisquit from this mix best luck on getting it right bisquick
negative,17/4/21,i will first say that i have only tried making pancakes with gf bisquick my family s experience with these pancakes however was very disappointing and i will not be trying any other recipe i have tried betty crocker s gf brownies and loved them so when i decided to spend a little extra and try gf bisquick i was greatly let down by the result we couldn t even finish them we just threw them out if you can tolerate tree nuts and milk products i recommend trying pamela s pancake mix otherwise if you are looking for great gf pancakes look elsewhere gf bisquick is not worth it in our opinion
negative,10/3/21,my personal preference is to stay clear of this i did not like the smell or taste i was attempting to make pizza crust for the first time on my second attempt it came out better but i did not like the taste of it if i at least liked the taste i would buy again and make my crust very thin
negative,17/4/21,i bought these for pancakes and i haven t used it to make any other recipes so i cannot speak for how it makes biscuits or any other item but for pancakes it s a no go they have a hint of pancake flavor with lots of butter syrup but i don t like smoothering my pancakes in fattening syrup so these pancakes are not for me moving on to other mixes
negative,21/1/21,when i saw the ingredients on this box i knew it would be a disappointment it would be much better and pretty easy just to make your own mix also there are plenty of other quality mixes out there like pamela s and bob s red mill this will be a huge disappointment to you so don t waste your money
negative,30/1/21,reading other reviews i was excited to try this mix since it appeared to be gluten free dairy free technically the dry mix is gf df but the basic pancake recipe calls for eggs and milk technically i can use my own egg and milk substitutes but then i could already do this with so many other mixes i ve found that mixes that request eggs and or milk really are better with the originals not substitutes the best gf df mixes already include a substitute so the directions only require water and or oil or other non dairy ingredients in this case i will return to my old favorite mixes by the cravings place these are truely targeted for a gf df lifestyle that said if you are not df then perhaps this is a fine choice it would have been better to have a print picture of the back of the package to more clearly see that this is not a great df option
negative,13/2/21,these pancakes are gross they are pale and do not taste like pancakes i bought these based on the reviews because the maple grove farms pancakes were out of stock that week i expected a lot more from bisquick i mean when these pancakes are fully cooked they look like pale wafers of cream of wheat if you leave them in a little longer to get some color they just get hard and taste worse i hate wasting food so i forced myself to finish the boxes but i do not think i ll buy these again even if my other ones are out of stock the only reason i gave these stars is because they are gluten free other than that they re awful i m so glad i ve got my maple groves back this week and that these are out of my pantry
negative,15/1/21,was awful the sight of this in my pan made me sick smells like potato duh potato starch would not brown my child laughed the entire time as i complained because i was so hungry and thought i could have a late night pancake session totally not the case yes i am a gf newbie i tossed the box
negative,6/3/21,pure toxic garbage eat poison if you want to toxic metals go ahead and buy this junk and feed yourself poison look at all the high ratings apparently people love eating toxic metals not harmful would you eat sodium mercury phosphate enjoy your metals
negative,8/6/21,a great idea that falls short bisquick gluten free still uses an aluminum based baking powder that is toxic to humans aluminum lodges in our bodies and has been found in quantities unacceptable in autistic individuals the company refuses to respond to customer inquiries concerning this i cannot give this to my family until the baking powder formula has been changed
negative,7/1/21,i actually was delighted to find this product and my family and i loved the recipes made with it however it has sugar as the nd ingredient and worse it has aluminum in it why would i intentionally feed my family something neuro toxic when i am trying to avoid gluten to keep healthy i sure wish those companies who jump on the gf bandwagon would keep health in the equation my kids bowel movements are gluten free too but i wouldn t serve it to them for breakfast just sayin
negative,17/4/21,i am thorougly disgusted with betty crocker for this product gluten free bisquick which is a shame because i do applaud them for their excellent cake cookie and brownie mixes i m not upset with them for for coming out with a gluten free baking mix but for marketing it as though it s an equivalent to bisquick and for pricing it so ridiculously high ingredients for regular bisquick enriched flour partiallly hydrogenated soybean and or cottonseed oil leavening dextrose salt ingredients for gluten free bisquick rice flour sugar leavening baking soda sodium aluminum phosphate monocalcium phosphate modified potato starch salt xanthan gum notice anything missing from the ingredients of gluten free bisquick yup that s right there s no shortening or oil that was the whole point of the original bisquick a baking mix that already had the shortening mixed in that avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits that is why people buy baking mixes for that specific convenience betty crocker has decided to leave out the shortening or oil altogether even though shortening or oil is always naturally gluten free so they can t pretend it s a safety for celiacs factor it s a cost savings to them pure and simple here s the breakdown of what you re paying a pound for rice flour cents a pound at my local asian store sugar for a pound bag at walmart potato starch also cents a pound at the asian store baking powder a pound at emergency essentials salt for ounces of morton s xanthan gum for ounce on amazon yes xanthan gum is expensive but very very little is needed a ounce box of gluten free bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gum maybe cents worth of xanthan gum betty crocker is charging over times what it would cost you to make their mix at home while eliminating the major convenience factor and cost to themselves but not to you of their regular baking mix i don t mind their making a fair profit especially if the product really were the equivalent of regular bisquick but they re gouging us and being misleading about the product make your own easily and for less than of what they charge since there s no oil in gluten free bisquick you can easily stir up an equivalent make pounds or more at a time with very little effort and it will keep for several months or if you want a real bisquick substitutes betterbatter org has a recipe on the site for a cup for cup substitute for bisquick that does use shortening and non fat dry milk powder or you can use buttermilk powder or even vance s dairy free powder it makes cups at a time stores well and you don t have to use their gluten free flour you can use any gluten free flour replacement you want like rice flour and potato starch from your local asian store mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum about teaspoon for every two cups to find the recipe do a google search of betterbatter bisquick substitute master mix boo on betty crocker
negative,10/3/21,i regularly purchase this item in the bulk and loved it because it was also dairy free however my last purchase was disappointing after opening a brand new package i noticed a black thing in the mix carefully removed to find out it was a dead flour beetle i sifted the mix and found more dead bugs this is the second time i writing this review amazon didn t publish my first review thank you amazon i will not be purchasing this item again
negative,14/1/21,i have been gluten free since and this is i think the worst tasting gf mix i have come across i have found all to have their own pros and cons but this one have very little to brag about i appreciate the effort anyone puts into a gf product but i couldn t buy this one again it was like eating reconstituted potatoes that lookes like pancakes no butter or gravy just dehydrated spuds the only real good thing to speak of was the texture it was light and moist but i would have to seriously alter the recipe to add flavor
negative,24/5/21,i read lots of good reviews and loved the idea of the convenience of this mix for pancakes and waffles so i whipped up some pancakes breakfast for dinner style i m newly diagnosed celiac and thus new to gf so perhaps i should let a little more time go by on just a diet of naturally gluten free foods before i start trying substitute foods for the wheat foods i used to love but i swear i cried a little bit when i ate these pancakes because i thought they sucked frankly they are completely bland and have no flavor at all and the texture was reminiscent of wallpaper paste i don t know if that s gluten free but if so it s probably cheaper to just put some syrup on that and eat it after letting the batter stand minutes to thicken up a bit it was more like kindergarten paste but still totally flavorless my year old daughter gobbled them up so that s something then i cried a litle bit more thinking about the fact that i guess i ll never get to teach her how to make a real delicious fluffy wheat pancake but that s a whole other thing i m giving it stars just because it is useful for breading oven baked chicken but you could do that more economically with another gf flour
negative,14/10/21,the pricing is quite a bit higher than in the grocery stores it is not available in all stores but i have found it conveniently enough for my purposes
negative,7/2/21,i am giving this two stars as my family did not mind the taste but the texture was so grainy and the biscuts fell apart easily i was not a fan of the pancakes at all i believe they really did not have a good flavor will not be wasting my money on such a tiny package either when you can but a bigger package of regular mix for less not fair to us with allergies in my opinion
negative,29/3/21,going gluten free is not optional for those diagnosed with celiac disease but eating a pizza made with a dough created with this product is optional and definitely not recommended i knew something was amiss when i opened the product and it was the consistency of very fine white beach sand putting my reservations aside i proceeded to make pizza dough as directed on the box needless to say the pizza dough was chewy and tasted very strange i would not recommmend this product for pizza dough
negative,17/4/21,bisquick gf is easy to use pancakes and muffins are very tasty the product is quick and easy to use it makes my day gram
negative,10/3/21,these sticks definitely don t look like ones in the picture they are much thinner and imho not worth the money i should have returned it but instead gave my dog gsd at a time to keep her busy i d stick with the redbarn or equivalent from another website
negative,10/7/21,i just received my order of count regular bully sticks and am extremely disappointed only valuepetsupplies bulk bully sticks are hand measured for consistent thickness i beg to differ the regular size is quoted as thickness the product i received is less than in thickness out of pieces less than five actually measured up to the regular thickness advertised my blue heeler dispatched one piece in less than a minute it usually takes him five minutes on the other hand my toy fox terrier is still working on hers and won t leave leftovers for the big guy to clean up while i understand that valuepetsupplies com sponsors good causes i will be spending an extra cents per piece and get a much more substantial treat
negative,27/1/21,i ordered these despite my concerns after reading other reviews re small diameter size absolutely true and i regret making the purchase for the same price i briefly ordered from a different amazon vendor the same and length bully sticks for the same price difference original vendor bully sticks were on average thick this vendor bully sticks are at most thick with most closer to what difference does it make our dog a slender lb mixed boxer chow would take days to get through a bully stick and would get hours and hours of good gnawing time in on each one these new thin ones she completely consumes in less than mins that makes a huge difference in how fast we go through the bag will not order again from this supplier
negative,1/6/21,apparently regular size thinner than standard sized pencils my chihuahuas finish these in a matter of minutes when it normally takes them days to consume a thicker bully stick
negative,20/8/21,i have used this mix for years for yellow pound cake and everyone seems to love it i m still able to purchase the oz at my local grocery i was going to order this product but saw that it was oz and was afraid it wouldn t go with the old duncan hines pound cake recipe hope these companies realize the damage they are doing to time proven recipes when they downsize their products
negative,14/8/21,in the past i was able to make so many different cakes using this cake mix i made rum cakes today thinking i had done something wrong when the first one didn t turn out as usual i now realize i didn t do anything wrong duncan hines did something wrong by reducing the size of their product i would gladly have paid more for the larger mix now i will never buy another dunkin hines mix how dumb do you think we are
negative,21/4/21,duncan hines used to be my favorite line of cake mixes i bought them all of the time but now they like betty crocker have downsized their packages of cake mix these new mixes will not work with older recipes that called for the ounce size of cake mix that rules out a lot of our favorite cakes even a plain cake will be changed it won t bake up as high or as big in the pan duncan hines just lost me as a customer pillsbury has not reduced their cake mix sizes at least not yet i will be buying them if they shrink in size i will bake from scratch
negative,1/4/21,i have bought duncan hines yellow cake mix in the past and have made a favorite recipe with it in the past it had ounces pillsbury and betty crocker have the required ounces i bought duncan hines at safeway because it was less expensive than the other brands and after i got home i discovered why i will not buy duncan hines again unless they go back to the ounces or go to ounces for consumer beware and read the number of ounces in the product
negative,17/4/21,maybe i got a bad one it s very plain nothing special in flavor i felt like i wasted my time and money i will not buy this flavor again
negative,10/3/21,i made one for my daughter s birthday party and everyone but her died of uranium poisoning still tasted pretty good though
negative,22/4/21,be advised you will only receive one box they are less than in the local grocery store will not purchase again
negative,25/4/21,four of the eleven glass vials arrived broken the product is apparently not able to be returned so i just wasted dollars
negative,1/4/21,one of the vials was broken when we received this product but you can t return the product or get a refund what a rip off
negative,30/6/21,while the flavor and quality of this chili is great the ounce can is mostly liquid the number of servings is listed as but the reality is that it will only serve about unless you add more of your own ingredients as the first reviewer indicated i won t be purchasing this again
negative,1/3/21,b you r n e d i read the other two reviews and didn t heed their warning that s on me they are usable but they were certainly burned
negative,29/1/21,i can t believe i wasted almost on this they were burned they were inedible it was so nasty and they took forever to arrive you should take this product off of your product list worst product i ve ever ordered
negative,17/4/21,i purchased boxes as gifts at per box i spent over and none could be used every piece was broken and could not be used for the seder sending a gift that is broken and can t be used is very embarrassing also the return window is april th which is ridiculous since the matzo was for the first seder which was on april th at night
negative,10/3/21,trader joe s pomegranate white tea is superior to this tea this is very bitter and perfumey maybe that is what you get when you brew whole leaves and stems i found it repulsive
negative,30/5/21,some reviewers say the coffee is bitter i like bitter but i didn t like this it wasn t a good bitter taste it was a cringe kind of taste i drink one of the strongest coffee s out there and this was too much for me the strange taste of it turned me off i once owned a coffee pot by melitta too and it took a cone shaped special filter i wasn t impressed with that either maybe i m just not big on arabica coffee or whatever it is but the taste was unpleasant to me not smooth bitter yes but not smooth it smells ok i agree with charlie another amazon reviewer who said the package was difficult to open it was sealed extremely tight and when you did eventually get it open the bag tore apart no way would i spend bucks for this if i was addicted to it possibly but even then that s steep and i surely won t buy this in the future you can go down to the local name of popular coffee shop here and get bags for this price of freshly ground coffee melitta makes it sound like it s the greatest thing since sliced bread on their package gourmet swiss water process from europe s charming sidewalk cafe s top quality hand picked beans if you want to pay this kind of money and like melitta coffee then get it but i don t think it s anything special
negative,28/9/21,the initial aroma upon opening the package was decent though subtle unfortunately it quickly dissipated i really couldn t smell anything after a minute which i assume is due to it being pre ground i brewed this coffee in a french press as well as in a drip brewer both results tasted flat and boring although there was a decent amount of body at least it was inoffensive perhaps a notch up from bad diner coffee for about the same price you could get better tasting fresher beans from a cafe or natural foods store
negative,6/5/21,i ve read lots of other reviews deeming this tea as coffee tasting or with roasted flavors but to be very truthful it tastes just the way i could imagine second hand smoke would it s very very strong requires minutes to steep and is not for the faint hearted i ve heard wonderful reviews related to weight loss regarding this product but i was not able to tolerate the taste long enough to actually see any weight loss benefits good luck to those who care to brave this roasted flavor
negative,20/4/21,this was the worst tasting tea actually the worst tasting anything that i have ever consumed i took one sip and could not bring myself to finish the cup it tasted like dirt which makes sense since it is a root the rest of the tea bags are going in the trash
negative,20/4/21,first let me state that i brew most of my tea in a gaiwan hence i use loose leaf tea white tea is one of my favorites so i m always on the lookout for a nicely priced bai mudan as much as i love bai hao yinzhen i just cannot afford to drink it exclusively due to the volume of white tea i drink i thought this was a pretty good price and when i opened it up it didn t look too bad either much to my surprise after taking the first layer off the top i transfer my tea to good tea tins it was nearly all powder dust with hardly any intact leaves this is extremely problematic if you don t use any filters or screens like me i don t mind when some tea leaves get in my tea and it is pretty much normal if you don t pour through a screen however this was so broken up that it was just unworkable i have only opened one bag at this point so there is a chance that it was just that bag or possibly even a bad batch but at this point i most likely won t be ordering it again that being said the whole leaves that were there on the top looked fine it does have a bit of a green tea taste vs some other high quality white tea i am used to however it isn t bad or anything definitely drinkable on a regular basis if the bag wasn t mostly powder i took a couple pics so i will post them keep in mind this came in two pouches i poured into tins and that is where i took the pictures the product does not actually come in tins
negative,21/4/21,i also bought two of these as gifts and will be returning them for the same reason as some of the others unacceptable packaging unless you have already tried the product there is nothing about this that makes you want to try it i assumed big mistake that there would be some kind of packaging but there was not this is really sad too because the product is great
negative,2/5/21,i purchased this as a present but it doesn t come as shown in the picture it is little white bags with the flavor written on them someone receiving it as a gift wouldn t even know what it was unless i explained it to them will be returning
negative,18/12/19,after reading all the great reviews i optimistically ordered some of this tea i ve had problems with sinus congestion very often this winter and have tried all kinds of remedies with little success unfortunately this really didn t do anything for me the taste is ok bearable but it did nothing to relieve my sinus congestion so far the only things i ve found that have helped me somewhat are the vicks personal warm mist humidifier and neti xlear
negative,19/1/20,this tea didn t do anything steal have issues with itching throat ear and everything else but i do enjoy the smell of it ill say it last up to a few hours and that s it
negative,19/1/20,i had high hopes when i purchased this produce shipping was amazingly fast and i ve tried it a few times i don t enjoy the taste and since i don t sweeten my tea it wasn t that great and it did nothing for my sinuses will not purchase again but i do recommend the seller
negative,31/3/20,i bought this tea during a major sinus infection crisis which included headache earache toothache i drink multiple cups over a few days and am sad to report it had absolutely no effect taste is so so but that s not really what matters as every sinus sufferer knows if eating dirt would make the pain go away we d eat dirt
negative,18/12/19,i have ordered numerous teas potions lotions and other remedies but have never had a lack of product in an order that was sealed the tea bag wrapping in question was sealed without a tea bag inside i would have said something sooner however i only tried these when i had a sinus infection and the last times i tried to use one the sealed pouch was empty beware
negative,13/10/19,all natural beef but too soft for my taste doesn t have the snap and drier outer surface that some like this is a matter of personal taste the product is good just not for everyone i suggest trying this company s old fashioned cold smoked beef sticks strong hickory flavor a good bite of spice and drier texture this company has superb customer service
negative,28/9/20,i couldn t resist the price so many beef sticks for so cheap however i think i was expecting something different the jerky has a good taste and at first it wasn t very oily but as they got older and exposed to the air i did notice some oil spots forming through the casings of the sticks overall if you can consume this say within week of opening they are great if you need something that will stick around longer stick get it then maybe this isn t the right product they also sent me a free sample of some of their other products with my order and the shipping was quick i like the company the beef sticks just weren t what i was looking for i guess
negative,16/11/20,i guess it does the job okay and it s much cheaper than hour brand but the packaging it arrived in was in spanish since i don t speak or read spanish i was a little leery of this item since it was impossible for me to read ingredients and nutritional information panel the item is labelled as being made in the usa but the website on the label has a mx extension for being a mexican company i don t have anything against our neighbors to the south i just expect that when i buy something on amazon that the labeling will be in english unless otherwise stated
negative,27/2/20,i took a chance with this product even though there weren t enough good reviews since they are cheaper than hour energy they did not work for me so i tried red rain which did work and was even cheaper red rain did work for me so i am done with hour energy and hour power the ingredients are pretty close to hour energy but someone is lying since it doesn t work
negative,26/2/21,i ve tried a few of the different energy shots and found that the hour energy have a flowery note lavender in all of their flavours i can t say i like it the effect is ok but the flavour is like bad flat orange pop and is otherwise uninspiring i think i d prefer the more standard berry flavour of other shots vs this one
negative,18/12/19,i had to be taken to the er in an ambulance earlier the day before yesterday i was having seizures near syncope passing out but still being somewhat conscious couldn t breathe and my blood pressure was at stroke level i felt like and thought i was dying or maybe already dead for about hours it was painful and horrifying i think i figured out what it was that caused my near death experience it was probably the energy shot i took minutes before then i don t usually take something like that someone offered it to me and i was so tired i didn t even look at the bottle and took it please don t use these
negative,19/1/20,i purchase banh trang spring rolls skin frequently to prepare a tasty batch of fresh spring rolls but recently i got a container with black spots mixed into the skin i tried to rinse them off when they were soaking but it didn t work and had to be thrown away at the bottom of the container skins had what looked to be tiny ants embedded within the skin at that point i decided not to have fresh spring rolls at all until i purchased a fresh batch of a different brand when trying to find the company on the internet to write them directly i was unable locate their company webpage although there were many references to the co name bahn trang
negative,13/9/20,i bought this brand and it was just horrible amazon needs to source and offer ladies brand wrappers as they are just superior to anything out on the market today
negative,10/7/20,i have one cat who cannot tolerate this particular fancy feast salmon product it is only the shredded one that gets her but get it does everytime she eats it she throws it up all over everywhere my shoes the white rug and gratefully the tile she ate this for several years with occasional upsets but now it is every time no more for this family i realize that this occurs on an individual basis usually but i also have one younger kitty who is at the occasional upset stage so if you have a kitty with a tender tummy i would avoid this
negative,14/4/21,i was not impressed with these cookies when i tried them when they first came out and the company had only one flavor i did not care for them but i knew that something more satisfying could be had because i d tried others i have found many great paleo cookie recipes on web sites and in paleo cookbooks that i love and they my friends cooking students and neighbors have really enjoyed if you re looking for rock your taste buds paleo cookies i suggest you check out the recipes for chocolate chip cookies and other flavors of cookies made from blanched almond flour found in the gluten free almond flour cookbook make it paleo and on elana amsterdam s web site
negative,24/4/21,formula itself is great works wonders for a baby that spits up but wtf why is it so expensive here for oz cans that s for a oz can when you can buy a oz can at any store for less than almost double the price i don t get it
negative,28/4/21,i love using generous amounts of vinegar on sandwiches salads etc but this drink was so vinegary that i got a bit of a tummy ache it tasted closer to salad dressing than it did a drink i tried really hard to like it but no go
negative,12/7/21,i bought these bars for several years at my local co operative grocery store and ate them daily they are tasty however the price increased nearly during that time and i noticed that although the individual wrappers within the box remained the same size the bar within the wrapper decreased when i stopped buying these the actual bar was only half the size of the wrapper that s deceptive packaging so i refuse to buy these any more i suspect that other shoppers likewise complained because last month the store where i bought these stopped carrying them
negative,18/12/19,these aren t as good as other bars of this type my kids won t eat them nor will my husband they are all fond of the nutrigrain variety but i thought these would be a healthier alternative
negative,19/1/20,looked like a good deal so i ordered the ground fennel as well as other spices and seasonings from this company but was disappointed with them all zero flavor not even the fragrance of the right herbs or spices when loosely sealed containers were opened the dill smelled like dried musty grass and the onion even worse ended up throwing them all away save your money do not buy this product
negative,28/4/21,most of the nuts in these bags were so old they had turned black totally worthless will never order again
negative,8/8/20,i did not even receive the correct product what i received were raw unshelled peanuts but had no option to return them becuase amazon does not allow this i attempted to contact but got no reply do not buy from here
negative,22/5/21,be careful when odering this because they say it s a pk but you will only get a pk plus the formula goes out in months so if you did like i did and got it early for grandchildren your out of luck so i know i will not be buying off of this site again for food for my grandchildren because they won t be able to eat it
negative,18/12/19,if one reads this products ingredients they will find that the first ingredient is cows milk then sugar diabetic maker then milk again the fourth ingredient is sunflower oil fifth ingredient is maltodextrin which is starch produced from grain containing the sugars maltose and dextrin with the seventh ingredient being get this tuna fish oil they even feature vitamin d which is animal derived there are four different sugar sources in it and some artificial flavor for good measure if we really think about what we are feeding our babies would we use this product i know i wouldn t know your food sources
negative,19/1/20,these were rancid upon receipt terrible very little sugar if any used something went wrong with these as i can t believe anyone would see this as a final product both cans
negative,3/8/20,i felt ripped off the photo clearly shows two bones and the price at plus is indicative of two i thought i was purchasing a bone packaged as two to a pack walmart sells identical big smoked knuckle bones for ea why doesn t the photo show one bone instead of two if they are just shipping one it wasn t worth the hassle to return the package to make my point of protest so i am doing it here beartoothjoe
negative,29/7/21,is that these are calories per serving however in all honesty i didn t make it through a full serving i was excited about these they looked like a grown up graham cracker first problem was the smell they smelled like melted plastic and something else i d hesitate to even guess what it is but it s bad i bravely pulled out one small crisp hoping that maybe it was the packaging that had the aroma it was not the crisp itself smells horrific i figured there was no way it could taste as bad as it smelled second problem is that i was very very wrong about that they have a funky chemical taste that just defies description the aftertaste is sort of like a skunky chewing on a plastic pen cap that went thru the wash wet cardboard kind of taste seriously it was awful i tasted these about minutes ago and after drinking an entire bottle of water and brushing my teeth i can still taste it i m glad these were an add on but they are still absolutely terrible their only redeeming quality is that they are cute not one single member of my family will actually eat them though so this was definitely a waste of had i known they would be this awful i d have just got a second bag of hi i m skinny sticks sweet onion multigrain ounce only cent more than these but miles better in taste
negative,8/7/20,tortilla soup is one of my favorite soups and i like both the tomato and chicken broth varieties although i didn t expect freshly fried tortilla strips or queso fresco in a canned soup i did expect something that resembled all other tortilla soups i have tried that is a light broth with a mix of vegetables corn beans chicken and mexican spices this soup is thick really thick like the thickest tomato soup you ve ever had with a grilled cheese sandwich it s also sweet and does not taste in the least like a mexican soup instead imagine straight tomato soup with a bunch of vegetables beans and some chicken thrown in i ended up giving it all away and to be fair one of the people i gave the soup to said her husband really liked it for a canned soup that much more closely resembles real tortilla soup try campbell s select mexican chicken tortilla ounce cans pack of
negative,13/4/21,coconut water should not be sweetened actually no sugar should ever be added sweeting things is an american custom which ruins the real flavor of coconut water i lived in jamaica for years and the bahamas for and the coconut water from real coconut does not have any added sugar its natural i will stick to buying the brown hard she will coconuts from the supermarket and drink that it s more natural and unaltered these boxed caned and packaged coconut water are nasty i am still yet to try a brand one of the many that i have tried that will make me want to buy it
negative,20/2/21,it says habenero peppers on the ingredients but my guess is they just waved it over the closed bottle smells like molasses and soy sauce taste like molasses and soy sauce absolutely boring
negative,9/12/20,tastes too sweet which jerk seasoning is not walker s woods is the most authentic to taste this was a waste
negative,1/4/21,i thought i would try this but i am sticking with my uncle joes jerk sauce this is sweet not hot should be hot if they are going to put jerk on the label
negative,25/2/21,first of all somebody is chasing me around and negging all my review so do not pay any attention to those no votes they both arrived within minutes of posting this review this sickly sweetish molasses flavored thing is not jerk sauce does not even remotely resemble a bad facsimile i do not know what world harbors is thinking because this stuff is horrible by the way i like their teriyaki sauce but this its as bad as it gets
negative,18/12/19,i wanted to love this because i love earl grey tea i need decaf and i adore the convenience of the keurig unfortunately i don t love these the flavor is very weak and doesn t deliver on the aroma i typically use the large cup setting on the size model but even the small cup is wimpy with these i did find that mixing this one with a stronger flavored decaf tea results in a more suitable strength but then you have to make cups of something the english breakfast decaf is a much better choice
negative,19/1/20,this slop has the color and consistency of baby diarrhea with whole peas in it our cat ate less than half a bowl of this slop and immediately puked all over the carpet she devours the felidae platinum which we feed as an occasional alternative to newman s own turkey she was raised on felidae dry so i can say that generally the canidae company provides quality products except for this grain free slop you can find the good stuff at felidae canned cat food for senior and overweight cats platinum diet formula pack of ounce cans absolutely do not order this slop from amazon because they will charge you for the privilege of returning the cans your cat will not eat before you make the same stupid mistake i did buy a can from your local pet food store and try it out first then when your cat pukes this slop back up you will only be out instead of the amazon nailed me in my opinion your cat and you will be much better off with newman s own organic cat food especially the turkey and chicken the newman food literally brought our cat back from the brink of death after we listened to our former vet and fed her science diet k d she dropped down to less than pounds in a month we switched her back to newman s own turkey and within one case of small cans she was back up to her usual weight of lbs and has maintained that healthy weight for over months she also gained increased mobility after we stopped feeding her the k d i read somewhere that science diet buys veterinary students their books in exchange for their later recommendations of their products nice just say no to science diet and felidae grain free formula here s the good stuff newman s own organics turkey vegetable formula for cats ounce cans pack of did they really want me to post a video with this review would you then its unanimous this review will remain video free
negative,14/10/20,i ve been feeding wellness grain free for a while now and all three of them love it i ordered the felidae last time because the wellness was no longer eligible for free shipping and the felidae was which makes the difference between whether it is a better deal to order it or buy it at petco brick and mortar none of my cats will eat it they actually at nothing for the past days since the only thing offered them was the felidae i broke down today and gave them a back up can of lives grain free and they are happily curled up and purring now i think felidae is a high quality food and i only feed the lower quality grain free food on rare occasion but the rest of this case will be donated to my local shelter hopefully something there will like it i m off for the trip to petco for the wellness
negative,10/3/21,i was really hoping this grain free canned cat food will work for my cats looks like it has good ingredients but none of my cats will eat it in fact one of them will smell it and start doing the scratching thing like he smells poop another weird thing is the whole can is kind of soft and meshed like baby food but there are some whole green peas in it not sure if that is by design or some green peas escape the meshing
negative,15/8/21,yikes what was i thinking when i ordered cans of this stuff the food pantry may be getting some it tastes like well i can t use the words i d like to let s just say that it has no character at all no distinct taste if yu blinded yourself and then drank the coffee i don t know if you d even know it was coffee i use just more than the amount suggessted doesn t help
negative,27/4/21,the taste is great but it gave me a terrible migraine from the message those who are sensitive beware also message addition is usually a way to fake true flavor
negative,24/1/21,the packet of these seeds that i received must have been old because i don t believe even of them grew i tried some several times in soil and water and only got a few sprigs of grass i garden regularly i live in florida so it s not that i don t know how and i even followed the instructions to the letter but they did not grow
negative,14/7/20,look at the ingredients it is made with black tea google black tea and fluoride and you will see that black tea is loaded with fluoride because it is made with the oldest part of the tea plant it contains the highest level of fluoride of any tea fluoride is not healthy for anyone if you want a healthy natural tea get one that is made with white tea leaves white tea leaves still have all the beneficial antioxidant properties but much much much less fluoride than either black or green teas
negative,5/6/21,spent for real kona coffee and didn t want the kona blend sold here the hawaiian roasters was disappointing tasted nothing like the kona we had everyday while honeymooning in maui not good
negative,9/7/21,i like my chocolate tempered to some level of crispness these nuts were chewy not crunchy and the chocolate coating was a bit mealy if you know anything about dark chocolate and like yours with some snap don t order these actually the best dark chocolate covered walnuts are called perigord and are available through a canadian company called kis global they are sun dried super crispy covered in a fairly thin she will of dark chocolate and dusted with unsweetened cocoa very adult and superb
negative,5/6/21,we ordered the product our dog loves them but no one cares if its degrees outside recieved in one big melted ball thought they would ship in dry ice if its summer or hot in your area do not order them
negative,25/7/21,by the time i received this product all packages were melted so all had to be thrown away because everything in each bag had melted together
negative,13/7/21,i can not believe that this is actually for sale it needs to be recalled sugar is absolutely unhealthy for all your pets they do not digest assimilate sugar like we do every vet will tell you the same thing and you will never see any quality treats or food that has sugar or corn syrup on the ingredient list if you do see it on the list do not buy it
negative,9/7/21,this is my nd review for this product the first one was supposed to be words that would be too long for this item the product itself is good but the price for shipping for such a small item was ridiculous the package was small and light weight but i was charged for shipping of a item i have bought many items from amazon com and it seems here lately that the shipping has gotten totally out of hand i bought several items and the shipping was all together therefore i did not know how much was charged for each item i will not buy from this vendor again since they are making money on the shipping enough said
negative,8/7/21,on top of the delightful aspartame this comes complete with hydrogenated oils and is a dead ringer for country time lemonade mix
negative,15/7/21,instead of just being pork rinds oil salt and vinegar they have lactose and maltodextrin on them contributing to g of sugar per serving many people myself included who buy this kind of snack who are on low carbohydrate diets they will not be happy about the sugar the labeling on the package is very strange and i am surprised it gets by the nice government men who worry about this sort of thing it says total carbohydrates are less then g so they get to put zero grams ok fair enough i have seen that before but then the label admits to grams of sugar which is a carbohydrate how they can get away with saying they have zero grams of carbs when there are grams of sugar is beyond me i assume it is just that nobody has caught them yet then there is protein the nutritional analysis says g of protein per serving not bad for a snack food right next to the g is says not a significant source of protein huh a slice of cheese is about grams of protein as is an ounce of meet i believe those are significant sources of protein i went to their website to check out the nutritional facts i did notice they were high in sodium what i missed was that they claim the number of servings in a oz package was three so the sodium in a package is actually three times higher i doubt many people expect a oz package to be three servings i just looked up fritos corn chips a oz package is considered a single serving package and the analysis on the back shows one serving so when fritos tells you the sodium level it is only mg for the entire package for these pork rinds the oz package is mg of sodium about half of your daily requirement a little steep for a snack although i went to their site to look at some nutritional info they don t shows the label or the actual ingredients on their site or at amazon if they had i would not have purchased it they use partially hydrogenated oil a kind of fat may be destructive to your health long term since the government broke down and required that partially hydrogenated oil be listed on the label a lot of the food industry has switched away from it as people are correctly suspicious of it to add insult to injury i was unhappy with the taste they have a chemical nasty taste i suppose that is subjective but a few bites left me a little queasy i feel bad having bought this but perhaps my error will be of some use to others looking for a low carb snack please pass this company s products by and let s find someone else who can actually provide us the food we want and the information we need in a rational ethical and legal way
negative,6/7/21,this product which i am not allowed to return has ingrediants of salt spices hydrolysed soy protein that last item is the common industry con for adding message to your food every soup on your grocers shelf contains message but i digress so the third ingrediant is a form of message further down the ingrediant list is proudly displayed monosodium gludamate message this does not add spice to your food it stimulats your tongue into feeling that the food tastes good when it does not message can make dogfood taste like hamburger anyone who thinks this is making their food taste cajun may be serving alpo tones and durkee sp do not contain message i prefer tones i have eight ounce cans of this stuff would anybody like to buy some hamburger from me
negative,13/8/21,i bought this seasoning because amazon stopped selling the count konriko cajun seasoning so this was the one they had in a count i bought it thinking it would be similar to the konriko boy was i wrong first of all like another reviewer said some of the ingredients are as follows hydrolyzed soy protein and partially hydrogenated cottonseed and soy bean oil i was completely stumped as to why these two ingredients were necessary in a spice blend mix now i know why with the hydrolyzed soy protein as the other reviewer stated it s a industry way of adding message well why in the world do we need that and what s up with the hydrogenated soy bean and cottonseed oil beside it being bad for your health it causes the product to cake and clump i steer clear of products with hydrogenated oils in them an even though this may not have many trans fat an accumulation over time is what makes this deceptively bad for your health when i purchased this last year they did not have the ingredients listed in the description now it is i think that amazon as a regular practice should require all food products company s to list the ingredients of their product to sell on their site why wait until the customer purchase it to find out i don t think this is a customer friendly practice not a good buy i am going to i found my konriko at another site and will be purchasing it from there unless amazon brings it back at a count offer otherwise to buy one at and s h is just way over priced and highway robbery
negative,5/6/21,i agree with a previous reviewer when it comes to the dinners just about all of the earth s best choices they are watery and sweet apples or some other fruit in just about everything and the first ingredient is nearly always water i ve decided to stay away from these as much as possible and purchase protein containing dinners from another jarred brand or mixing my own i d really rather not nurture a sweet tooth at such a young age the earth s best fruits and vegetables for the most part are great just check the label to make sure water isn t the first ingredient listed i just love how baby food will have water listed first but then some kind of flour added as well to thicken it up
negative,9/7/21,as i have with all other earth s best jarred baby food i won t be purchasing these dinners for my baby because the jar lids contain bpa i contacted earth s best s consumer relations dept personally and the representative read me a prepared statement saying that the epoxy resin that lines earth s best baby food jar lids contains trace amounts of bpa but it doesn t come into direct contact with the food that kind of lukewarm response wasn t enough to put my concerns about bpa to rest after all packaged food is jostled around so much during shipping that these jars could spend days upside down with the food resting directly on the jar lids so i guess i ll have to pass on these jarred dinners for now the earth s best rep did say that they were doing accelerated testing of bpa free alternatives for lining their baby food jars this is such a shame because earth s best is the only company that makes organic pre packaged stage complete meals e g with meat protein veggies carbs starch in puree form all the other organic baby food manufacturers such as plum sprout ella s kitchen etc only make stage meals in chunky form earth s best does make some baby food in bpa free squeeze pouches but that doesn t include its dinner line i was hoping to be able to expose my little one to a wider variety of flavors and well balanced meals while still at the puree stage but i guess i ll have to wait until she s old enough for stage chunky meals or make her baby food myself virtually impossible for this super busy and domestically challenged mom lol
negative,17/6/21,i ordered this from amazon and they were pure liquid like water i did not feel at all comfortable feeding them to my daughter amazon customer service however was awesome and gave me a full refund
negative,31/8/21,bought this after reading the good reviews not sure if it has to do only with my package but rice and lentil mix literally has a smell of mold i actually opened two containers to make sure it wasn t just my nose playing tricks on me i love this brand and i am very disappointed
negative,7/8/21,we ordered the earth s best nd dinner variety pack along with the fruit variety pack we got the fruit variety pack and an oatmeal and fruit variety pack not the dinner pack found out we can t return the item either we will try the amazon phone help but if all else fails maybe my little one will like this stuff
negative,6/9/21,google propylene glycol to find out why i bought this product along with several others without running the ingredients by my wife first a nurse of years she was surprised when she noticed it we went a googling and poured my order down the drain afterwards there s pure and then there s not so much from the website propylene glycol a cosmetic form of mineral oil found in automatic brake and hydraulic fluid and industrial antifreeze in the skin and hair propylene glycol works as a humescent which causes retention of moisture content of skin or cosmetic products by preventing the escape of moisture or water the material safety data sheet warns users to avoid skin contact with propylene glycol as this strong skin irritant can because liver abnormalities and kidney damage also used in tyre sealant rubber cleaner de icer stain removers fabric softener degreaser paint adhesive wallpaper stripper i wrote the company about this concern and they never responded
negative,5/6/21,received bottles of concentrate from paragon mixed exactly to their specs and was extremely disappointed in four of the six flavors i am truly saddened to have to encourage you to not purchase the watermelon flavor this item has be returned for a refund
negative,9/7/21,i was disappointed to find out that the lids of earth s best jarred foods are coated with an epoxy lining that contains bpa i thought i was avoiding the whole bpa issue because these are in glass rather than plastic containers if it s in the lids it s going to get in the food as the food moves around in the jar during packaging shipping storage etc i was planning on being a devoted earth s best jarred food user because it was organic and in glass but then i found out about the bpa as a note if bpa doesn t bother you most of earth s best food is tasty
negative,19/6/21,packaging was fine but the baby food were rotten however amazon com does not let me return it this is not right i have put the pic of the food on packaging review page buyers should all take a look at it
negative,5/9/21,just off the phone with them aug and they said that yes they stopped putting bpa in the liners in oct of course there is old stock on the shelves so i asked how to tell whether the liners we have are the old with bpa or the new without bpa and the person there said to look at the inside the surface of the lid if it is all white then it is bpa free if it is metallic or gold then it s the old lids which did contain a bpa layer thought this might help some of you out there
negative,10/10/21,i ordered this because i really like this brand and i have never had any issue with them my son usually like all the flavors i ordered this and the pears were sour spoiled the other flavors my son refused to eat i am sure there was something wrong with it so i am not sure what happened but i will not be buying these online anymore
negative,29/9/21,i just called up customer service and found that since october all the jars are bpa free but the jars manufactured before october are still available in the market usually all these products have a long shelf life as they are vacuum sealed so the jars with bpa lining on the lids are still floating around in the market the consumers cannot tell the difference so what is the point in buying this when you do not know if you are giving your baby something that is bpa free or not this is very very disappointing from earth s best
negative,11/9/21,i usually feed earth s best baby food to my grandson he has never had a reaction of any kind to any baby food i have given him this is the first time i have tried this particular variety pack i fed him the peach oatmeal banana and apples and apricots for breakfast this morning shortly after i noticed he was scratching i looked and he had a rash i remembered reading a baby food review where someone mentioned an allergy so i checked and yes it is this variety pack i don t know what is in it that would because this type of reaction unfortunately i fed him two different jars so i don t know which one caused it but i don t want to take a chance of him having another one so out they go just thought i would let others know
negative,5/6/21,there is bpa in the lids and company claims it doesn t touch the food so it s okey why do they even write organic times around the lid not honest to their costumer i wouldn t even give star if l could
negative,9/7/21,i have a month old who eats food all of the time i bought this variety pack and noticed that the peach oatmeal is thick like a paste coincidentally as i was thinking that as i was feeding him he started choking and gasping for air he couldn t breathe and i had to give him the heimlich maneuver and luckily he started crying very scary and those jars went right in the garbage
negative,26/8/21,i love fact that this drink is neither too tangy or tos sweet the combimation of both is perfect and therefore quenches yor thirst without leaving an unpleant after taste t
negative,26/7/21,i would never buy this cake it looks horrible some of the fondant work on this seller s other cakes is shabby the piping is horrible worse than a cake you would buy at the grocery store the flowers look like red and green blobs how can you possibly think you should sell these to people
negative,11/9/21,i love green tea and green tea beverages when i saw this on sale i was happy to try it once i received it and tasted it i was not so happy first off tasted like the smell of dirty water best way i can describe it lol this has cane juice yet tastes like it doesn t have anything added calories for what no flavor no thanks so yeah all in all pretty flavorless beside the dirty water smell taste was a huge disappointment worse yet i bought pk cases now i have to doctor the rest up maybe just buy some lemons and make them into a green tea lemonade oh well i tried
negative,11/9/21,in the attempt to make blueberry cake for my brother i used the whole bottle and still didn t have a blueberry cake i added about half the bottle to the cake mix white cake not vanilla and the other half to the frosting white frosting not vanilla and it still only had a hint of blueberry flavor i was completely disappointed in all the time effort and money spent making it and it barely tasted blueberry i would have thought that using the whole bottle would have made a blueberry flavor i guess i will have to see if i can find actual blueberry extract and not blueberry flavored extract will not be wasting my money on this again
negative,15/9/21,something is very wrong the product is excellent i have been buying it for several years first at whole foods and then when they dropped the product i have been purchasing it online in fact i purchased it in its original larger size jar when the size was decreased to oz the selling price remained the same at whole foods i also purchased all flavors as this product is really delicious the price has been going up considerably i purchase jars per order to save on shipping with each order there is always another price increase my recent order of september for jars was apparently packed at the warehouse and sent to the store the store did not repack it each box of six was sealed with warehouse tape identifying the item it stated the name of the store it was shipped to as well as the flavor the following information shocked me and i quote rigoni fruit sprd oz pack retail did you note the price retail it did not state wholesale it said retail price no one sells it for yet the warehouse stipulates that is the retail price am i missing something here how many hundreds of dollars have i wasted i guess it is a matter of what the market will bear outrageous of course there is the additional shipping chg on principal alone i will give up on this product the greed is beyond comprehension i gave the product a low rating even though the product is excellent because it is incredibly overpriced
negative,5/6/21,so as soon as the delivery guy gave me the package i opened it ready to eat some gummy bears and all i got was a big goo of gummy bears due to the heat of the delivery truck it all melted into gel of course it is not refundable so now all i have is a bag a liquid multicolored goo thanks for making me throw away dollars good game amazon so think about if its summer or kind of warm stop and wait till december
negative,9/7/21,the taste is not horrible but it is not very good there is not a very good mango flavor i would not buy again
negative,14/9/21,this egg pasta ingredient was powdered egg product and as such not as tasty as those containing the real thing i don t like anything powdered but price was right can t have it all i guess
negative,29/9/21,i was really disappointed in these olives the are very mushy and i prefer a more firm texture cat cora s olives are much much better
negative,10/7/21,the picture and description was pure butter mini shortbread round then i decided to order it because i love them so bad but when i got the package it came out at mini chocolate chip shortbread which i don t like
negative,1/3/20,when habanero is in powder form it doesn t taste the same nor does it have the same heat it s almost physically impossible to get a habanero powder to taste decent go with habanero flakes instead they taste better and pack a lot more heat
negative,28/7/20,wasa crisp n light inside packaging cannot be recycled the crackerbread is excellent but its inside packaging is a cellophane or type of plastic that cannot be recycled anywhere in the six states i have contacted todate wasa has not revealed what the inside packaging is made of nor where i can recycle it
negative,28/7/20,this was my first experience of a bad darjeeling before i hadn t known there was such a thing the first brew yielded a dark rust color tinged with olive green the bottom of the cup was invisible the taste was sharp and astringent thinking i d brewed too long or too strong i set the first cup aside and tried again and then again a light brew of minutes improved the clarity however nothing i have tried since has removed a level of astringency and a furred taste that i associate with lesser teas the wet leaves are the typical size light brown but unexpectedly interspersed with limp green squares the aroma of dry tea in the bag reminds me of old hay neither moldy nor spoiled just old in contrast the davidson s keemun conjou which arrived in the same shipment smells and tastes like delicious keemun conjou and nothing else given the price i knew i was gamboling and consider this a lost bet i have given the product two stars instead of one because i haven t thrown it out yet i keep a supply of lipton s bulk tea for emergencies such as long periods of unemployment and i don t really need more emergency tea perhaps it will work for iced tea by no means am i an expert but i do value tea and so i hope this opinion helps other buyers who are trying to decide between two darjeelings davidson s ships quickly with value pricing and so i am not giving up on the merchant just on this particular darjeeling
negative,10/11/19,the price is right organic tea at a great price but that s as far as it goes i ve tried about of the davidsons so far and they just lack character
negative,1/3/20,i have never received anything like this from amazon before the product was packed in an old used golf ball box bizarre the cans were all dented and old looking the bowls were chipped up i thought oh well maybe the soup will taste good wrong three different flavors but they were all awful completely inedible all of them were horribly fishy and metallic tasting the worst canned soups i have ever tasted in my life poured them all out and donated the chipped bowls to charity complete waste of money
negative,3/8/19,while the product is delicious it s annoying that the peanut butter stays on the waxy paper instead of on the product you need a fork to scrape the peanut butter off the protective top sheet
negative,6/2/21,my cats are not picky eaters and lick their bowls clean of virtually anything i feed them wellness fussie cat fancy feast bff i tried feeding them tiki cat on separate occasions and my cats threw up both times i thought they may have gotten sick the first time from eating something off the floor but when it happened a second time i was certain it was the tiki cat i m not sure if i received a bad batch but i will certainly never be purchasing a tiki cat product again
negative,24/2/21,she liked the food a little at first but didn t want much to do with it the price is very high and not worth it if she ll only eat a couple of bites she had tried most of the flavors and would always have the same reaction
negative,13/5/21,this product smells so bad that i couldn t even try to consume it it smells sour and rancid and is detectable even before the package was opened the seller has a no return policy so i m out the i spent on this as it will go right into the garbage
negative,1/3/20,i have been making wonderful homemade vanilla with a recipe that i found on line using vanilla beans purchased from williams sonoma i decided to try spicy world vanilla beans rather than the much more expensive vanilla beans from williams sonoma two vanilla beans from williams sonoma in a pint of vodka resulted in a very dark richly aromatic vanilla after only two months i used three spicy world vanilla beans in a pint of vodka and after two months i had a liquid that looked like weak tea and had the aroma of alcohol i added three more beans and waited the results were disappointing so i added three more vanilla beans you can still see through the vanilla and it doesn t have the aroma of vanilla i am completely disappointed with the vanilla beans from spicy world they are totally worthless a complete waste of money i would not recommend them or purchase anything from spicy world
negative,28/7/20,i purchased these beans based on other reviews my plan was to make a premium vanilla extract for family members i purchased a very expensive vodka unusual bottles to fill and waited for my bean order to arrive i wasn t happy about the wait the beans arrived after the th and i rushed to open the package i could not smell the beans as others reported most of the beans were skinny shriveled more dry and a great disappointment i would not recommend this product i will be looking for another source
negative,13/5/20,this product had pretty good reviews so i thought it would be safe to buy packages so i did boy am i full of regret now i m stuck with packs of these beans and i can t return any them the moment i opened the bag i should ve known it had a stale sour smell to them but the optimistic side of me said these beans look fresh and plump maybe it won t smell like that once i scrape the seeds out i was wrong i made two test batches to see if it was the salt i was using to make my vanilla salt but they both have that weird sour rancid smell i ve made vanilla salt before so i know what it s supposed to smell and taste like unfortunately even after a few days this smell isn t going away i was really looking forward to making jars of vanilla salt to give out as cheap gifts but now i need to go buy more vanilla beans to replace these which is going to end up costing me i m so disappointed i haven t cooked with these seeds so i don t know if the taste and smell transforms with heat or with any other mixed in ingredient i know for sure though that if you re looking to make vanilla extract vanilla sugar or vanilla salt i highly discourage you from buying this product
negative,26/3/21,true the beans were huge moist and plump with a good mixture of really big fat ones and smaller skinny ones however the most noticeable aroma coming from the bag and the beans is best described as pungent with a side of sour is that normal i ve only ever used the crappy dried out grocery store version and was thrilled when i saw such a good deal on these can a vanilla bean expert tell me if that odd unpleasant aroma is what i m supposed to be smelling
negative,29/8/19,would have rated no star if available beefeaters chicken liver freeze dried treats for dogs are a product of china and irradiated for your protection according to the company s hold message called amazon com customer service and requested a full refund with pre paid returned shipping too bad none of this is in the product description amazon csr was very helpful and very cooperative postage paid shipping label received via email immediately thank you amazon com
negative,7/2/21,anyone see where theses are made i am avoiding treats from china because of all the problems lately and i do not see a country of origin here
negative,14/10/21,i m of russian descent and have been eating buckwheat for my entire life i live in the us and usually buy buckwheat in local russian or eastern european stores this is the first and last time i tried american made buckwheat here are things that i found it takes only min to cook this normally it takes min and this item is not branded as an instant buckwheat it tastes quite different than usual there is a strong metallic smell this item is overpriced just go to the closest russian or eastern european shop and buy the same thing times cheaper
negative,7/8/20,i really wanted a decaf product so didn t have a lot of options this powder essentially makes a chocolate flavored blended drink even when i use cold decaf coffee or espresso as the base the chocolate is what you taste when i think of an iced coffee drink i think of coffee with a hint of chocolate mocha not the other way around as other reviewers point out the calories is for half the packet and no milk added i will try a different brand next time i m still on the hunt for a mix that creates the same flavor i ve experienced once in a great while at a coffee shop or like the iced blended at a west coast chain cb tl that is overpriced to have shipped and i think is available sugar free
negative,1/3/20,i really wanted to like this as it was organic and came in a glass bottle but there was hardly any flavor at all i could barely smell it and even when i poured a generous amount on my dish it imparts little to no truffle flavor aroma my truffle salt is much more potent
negative,28/7/20,this was not good the flavor was lacking and barely came through unlike the hint water which i really enjoy i wanted this to be good and was so excited to get it but it just disappointed
negative,14/9/21,the oatmeal inside the canisters was good however the packaging by amazon was terrible every single can arrived dented and several of the cans popped open amazon treats products terribly i haven t ordered from amazon in a long time not since they sent me expired pirate s booty which i tossed i thought they had gotten better and decided to give them another try what a mistake never again customer service at amazon leaves much to be desired as well if you get someone they ll probably speak broken english and be very hard to understand then they will not understand the problem you ll have to ask for a supervisor who you hope will speak better english be prepared to wait a long time for a supervisor and you may be disconnected several times before actually getting through to a supervisor the supervisor will ask for every piece of identification imaginable not short of your ssn before saying well what do you want me to do uh you re customer service service the customer amazon has lost my business forever
negative,17/12/20,my baby enjoyed this flavor when i purchased it at a store i ordered a case of it from amazon the whole case arrived moldy each jar popped when i opened it too showing that it was properly sealed i contacted earth s best they said they would look into it but would not follow up with me given what is going on in our food industry i will not purchase any more products from this company it is to scary when feeding a baby amazon refunded me but did not take it any further be very careful and inform other families too update i was so disappointed with the lack of concern from earth s best and amazon i contacted the fda they referred me to the usda because the product contained meat they took it very serious and had also received several complaints they have come to my house and written a report if anyone else noticed this problem please contact the usda to report your claim problem they will investigate the problem and the earth s best plant to make sure they are following regulations

negative,14/7/21,i don t think it s eb i think it s amazon i buy eb from babies r us target and whole foods and haven t had any problems it s only the shipments from amazon that come moldy
negative,18/7/19,when i saw some of the earth s best jars offered as a gold box deal i remembered that i needed to offer a caveat to other parents my children have previously enjoyed many earth s best flavors which in general taste quite good so in february when there was a promotional offer through amazon we ordered two packs when they arrived one of the packs seemed ok but the other pack contained several broken jars and was leaking it smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second pack i noticed that the shipping box holding the two packs had air filled padding on only the top side of the box which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side i don t know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery but either way i was afraid to use the unbroken jars too because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too for more durable items i still order from amazon but i canceled my subscription of the earth s best jars and from now on will buy jars at a physical store where i can check them first
negative,1/3/20,i also ordered a flat of food they were on sale that contained the turkey and wild rice dinner one of them was also improperly sealed the lid popped we were lucky because i just happened to check that one now i m so paranoid that i check all of them several times i called earth s best and they assured me that they haven t had this problem before and that i shouldn t worry about it i m so suprised that this got passed qa qc inspection at a baby food manufacturer why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety
negative,28/7/20,my daughter thinks this tastes nasty and i agree she is sensitive to carrot so i was looking for a food for travel that delivers protein but doesn t contain carrot though she eats homemade turkey and peas all the time she wouldn t even take a full bite of this i tasted a little bit and i can see why
negative,13/6/20,this was not a hit it s bitter like maybe the carrots were not sweet and or not peeled and the main ingredient is carrots amazon should include the ingredients for all items quality control seems to be an issue this is the second gourmet meal flavor with this issue i had never had a bad experience with the eb products before very disappointing
negative,10/3/20,my girls seem to like this food they ve only ever shown an opposition to green beans but it is so messy it s apparently tomato based and it gets everywhere where we usually just wipe their faces gently you really have to clean them it simply turns their skin orange and the bowls and spoon end up crazy oily even after soaking
negative,9/5/20,my mo old daughter only eats earth s best products and loves all of them that is except this i can t figure out what it is but we finally concluded that it smells a little like catfood i tried feeding her this mango chicken flavor a few different times and she would only eat a few bites i gave up and donated the rest to the food bank hoping someone else s child would like it i have had a good experience with the subscribe and save products in general no broken jars and the quick delivery is great i find that it is cheaper than whole foods even with the coupons this is the only flavor of earth s best baby food that my daughter dislikes for what it s worth i suggest skipping this one or trying it in a variety pack first
negative,14/5/19,it was bad before we open them i saw them when we got i did open it had some spot green color i did not know what it was i was very upset do not buy this product
negative,19/10/20,when i saw some of the earth s best jars offered as a gold box deal i remembered that i needed to offer a caveat to other parents my children have previously enjoyed many earth s best flavors which in general taste quite good so in february when there was a promotional offer through amazon we ordered two packs of the tender beef spinach when they arrived one of the packs seemed ok but the other pack contained several broken jars and was leaking it smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second pack i noticed that the shipping box holding the two packs had air filled padding on only the top side of the box which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side i don t know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery but either way i was afraid to use the unbroken jars too because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too for more durable items i still order from amazon but i canceled my subscription of the earth s best jars and from now on will buy jars at a physical store where i can check them first
negative,1/3/20,this is for puppies the bag is super small the bag didn t last more than a day i thought it was funny when i got the bag i thought it was a gift to be honest
negative,28/7/20,i am big coffee lover this was some of the worst coffee i have ever had it smells wonderful but the taste is horrible i would not recommend purchasing this coffee at all
negative,7/3/20,several of the seller s listings indicate kona blend but the delivered product does not have this package printing as a long time kona coffee drinker the contents are more indicative of or less kona coffee have ordered twice and completely disappointed
negative,4/8/20,you have to put a lot of sugar in this to make it taste good the coffee just by itself kind if has a stinky smell like a poopy diaper or a pee pee poo poo puppy in a cup next time i am going for raspberry flavored coffee because the chocolate is like poop yuck
negative,26/12/19,i bought this bag and found it cheaper at smart and final it was also old and and white this was terrible i bought it to put in the candy canisters i give to co workers so i didn t find out it was old till a co worker informed me i was so embarrassed do not buy this candy it all ended up in the trash very disappointed
negative,28/3/21,this candy was obviously old each chocolate was discolored the krackel krispies were not crispy and the chocolate wasn t right peant butter cups and goodbars nasty the nuts are horrible hersheys pulls their candy off of the shelves in the stores when it is getting old seller must have bought it up sold it here last year or the year before it has to be at least or more years old do not buy chocolate from zany values it isn t good for you i m sure that if the candy were fresh that it would have been just fine i have re ordered from a different vendor and will let you know if theirs is fresh as it should be or not
negative,6/2/20,i don t know what all the positive reviewers here are raving about i tried ghiraradelli s premium cocoa mix and found it much too sweet that it was almost unpalatable and not a very chocolatey taste either the directions given for one serving are tbsp of the powder to oz of milk did they meant tsp using their directions would yield a total of cups of hot cocoa not very economical for a product with so much sugar i had high hopes for this product but was very disappointed
negative,25/4/21,very bitter i couldn t taste the coffee at all it basically tastes like baking cocoa no sweetness no richness not coffee i bought the pack though so i ve begun mixing it half and half with swiss miss in the can and then sprinkling it with instant coffee after i ve made a cup even making it with whole milk couldn t make this yummy by itself if you like a rich chocolate taste with just a bit of coffee shop elsewhere
negative,3/8/20,i love hot cocoa and hot chocolate and have tried many different brands ghiradelli is by far the worst that i have ever tasted i honestly don t have any idea how they ever became famous for their hot cocoa this cocoa has an awful stale taste and you can tell that it is made of cheap ingredients it even tastes worse than the much lower cost brands like swiss miss and nestle if you want a real hot chocolate look up marie belle it is thick and rich not weirdly processed garbage like ghiradelli
negative,15/4/19,not really sure what i expected but since i like ghirardelli chocolate and i like hot chocolate and hot mochas from coffee shops i thought i d like this product unfortunately despite following the directions and making this in milk it s not as rich and satifying as i hoped i hate to say it but i think swiss miss mixed instant coffee tastes better than this that s unfortunate because this is a four pack of cannisters and i m only half way through the first one
negative,9/3/18,i only use c h bakers sugar for all my baking needs and i go through it fast with a lot of baking i looked on amazon to see if i could purchase it in a case for ease and cost savings at the grocery store one lb carton costs less than so to get three of them it would cost or less here on amazon it is plus shipping that totals for a product yep that s almost times more expensive than if i just purchase it at the local grocery store i love amazon and was really shocked to see this price this is a definite no thanks i know better than to purchase this item here
negative,18/5/18,too soft i just used this sugar to bake one of the layers for a firm pound cake like layer cake intended for decoration wilton butter cake recipe this is a pretty hardy cake and can stand up to changes in temperature etc and still turn out well i had already baked several of the layers with regular granulated sugar before i ran out and decided to use some of this baking sugar be forewarned this sugar makes cakes far too tender the layer literally fell apart coming out of the pan and it was well cooled and in a pan liberally covered in cake release even when i was mixing the batter it for some reason stuck to my stainless bowl and was impossible to scrape entirely out i m sure this is good for meringues and such but i would never attempt to use it again for a cake or even cookies you would never get them out of or off the pan
negative,9/3/18,the seeds are fresh the shells are hard and the seeds are jumbo sized the taste is good but the over powering amount of salt ruins the experience the ranch flavor would be much tastier if the salt used were lessened then again without the overwhelming amount of salt david might have to use a bit more of the flavor for which you are actually paying by the way i don t often find items too salty but this borders on the ridiculous i am going to i wholeheartedly endorse the jumbo size seeds as they are much more enjoyable than the puny regular sized sunflower seeds by david i will be buying another brand of sunflower seeds in the future hoping that it will not have the amount of salt the david s have update i finished all but a little of the case of david buffalo ranch flavored seeds and bought a case of the jumbo brand ranch flavored sunflower seeds i compared them back to back the jumbo brand is far less salty and flavorful compared to david s it will be interesting how i will find the jumbo brand to be after eating them for awhile right now they seem a bit under flavored still that is preferable to david s overuse of salt
negative,27/2/18,the product is a good value for the amount you get however it is way too salty the product is very dry and firm i think this would be good if they cut the salt content in half
negative,20/2/18,i m really disappointed with the changes in quality it s not even the same product that we used to love a couple of years ago the product was consistently fantastic but now the taste quality of the meat and freshness are hit or miss and recently it s all been a miss
negative,22/3/18,i read the reviews and thought i like salt i thought the saltiness was on the exterior of the jerky there is very little salt taste on the outside of the jerky but the saltiness comes out with every chew the strips are about the size of a chopstick or a very thin pencil ounces for is way too expensive there is very little beef flavor but too be fair it is probably covered up by the salt these taste very similar to the chopped and formed cheap jerky at the convenience mart that you swear you will never buy again but much more salty the amount of salt made my tongue numb if you want good jerky keep looking jack link s smokehouse beef jerky strips wood smoked count jar
negative,12/3/18,the jack link s jerky strips were verrrryyyy skinny some were only about inch wide and counted as one strip if i had known this i would not have ordered the beef jerky strips tasty but totally not worth the money
negative,9/2/18,too salty enough said i order the wood smoked count jar remember the price is for only one jar not two
negative,7/12/17,i like almost everything about this jerky the toughness and chewiness but it is just too salty if you nibble it you may enjoy it but that is not how i eat also it is not good for my health to eat something this salty i have run into too many of salty beef jerky patches recently this review is for the wood smoked but if other flavors contains the same amount of salt per serving they will be just as salty why everything is either too fatty sweet or salty are they trying to get us addicted
negative,24/5/19,i buy jerky all the time always willing to try something new i ve even made my own at home i agree with the review that called these salt sticks they are way too salty for my taste also being a jerky eater for years i eat it because i like the toughness and chewiness of jerk but the tube i got was nearly un chewable i have bit into some hard jerky in my time but jeez louise these were literally like chewing leather many of the strips would not yield to my super powered bite
negative,9/3/18,this is a good name and a good value the texture and size of the jerky is fine but be prepared for the salt it ruined it for me
negative,18/5/18,wow the hickory smoked jerkey sticks were incredibly salty i could not even eat half of the stick i have had different people try them and they had the same problem they are so terrible it tastes like you are dumping salt into your mouth avoid these at all costs
negative,23/3/18,first time ordering this jerky from amazon and i highly recommend to everyone do not buy it it is harder than a rock i have bought it from other sellers not amazon and it is much better the experation date is not for another year but you cannot even bite it or chew it horrible i think its the worst jerky i have ever bought
negative,8/9/20,i don t eat beef jerky and i wanted to buy some for a christmas gift i read all of the reviews at amazon com and decided that jack links would be the best purchase it came nicely packaged but there is liquid in the packaging a lot of it if you turn the packaging upside down the movement of the liquid is obvious so now i have to pay to return soupy beef jerky and buy a different type three days since my original review amazon cannot accept returns of food items so it kindly replaced the beef jerky the replacement also has liquid in it it s not fat but a liquid as described above this time i m asking for a refund
negative,23/2/18,i buy jack links peppered jerky every month i tried these as this was the first time seeing them don t waste your money they are so tough even the kids would not eat them they do not taste anything like the other peppered jerkys stick with the oz or the oz sticks they are moist and not so much grizzle
negative,18/7/20,this is the worst jerky i have ever tasted it is not edible i actually gave it to my dog and he spit it out i kid you not don t buy this product unless you are a bar owner and want your customers to guzzle beers to put out the salty fire that is created when you eat a small bite of this crap i deserve a refund for buying this dog food oh excuse me i forgot even my dog won t eat it
negative,14/6/18,i did not realize when i decided to purchase these that they were boxed and because of that i found them stale and hard i had previously purchased these at a local store who packaged them in plastic and they were soft and fresh sorry that i could not give these a better review
negative,2/11/18,i haven t had a cat yet that liked this one it s just a little too interesting for them i think it smells nasty but i think it s just the taste that really gets them my current cat just won t touch it he might eat a couple of bites if he s really hungry but i always wind up throwing it out this one is ground so if your cat likes pieces don t try this one
negative,14/10/18,this says pack so i assumed like other purchases that i made that it was boxes each with packs big mistake you only get four little pouches who would pay over for a little squirt of applesauce don t make the same mistake buy elsewhere
negative,6/4/20,i honestly have to say that i just won t buy this variety it looks bad smells bad and i m sure tastes bad because my cat won t touch it no way no how won t even look at it my other cat was the same way with this one it just looks like a huge ground up mess of leftovers they had at a fish market i m sure some cats must like it because it s still being made but there s other things out there much much better than this one
negative,9/3/18,instead of a black graduation cap a top hat was sent instead not great for a graduation gift also i think any buyer should be aware that by godiva pack they mean pieces of candy very confusing description especially when you consider that the picture shows at least pieces of candy definitely not worth the price
negative,18/5/18,many people are buying this food believing it is safer because it is made in new zealand it is now made in the us by performance pet products i have been feeding this food to my cats since the recall horror of and prior to the change it was excellent food and i was thrilled with it since ziwipeak has been switched to canning in the us it has been a nightmare several times in the last year i have opened the food to find it is a green or blue colour i had to return those cans because it made both my cats vomit and have loose stools also recently i have found large sharp bone pieces are present and very large strange chunks of greyish pink material that looks like connective tissue i ve contacted the us distributor twice but they have never replied a batch i got this month with an expiry date of has caused severe vomiting and shedding with both cats who were previously healthy
negative,7/3/18,my cats absolutely would not eat this food so it was a waste of money it is just sitting in our cabinets i will donate it to a shelter
negative,24/1/19,in christmas i first ordered clayton fruit cakes they where great nice big cherries and other fruits and nuts these were overloaded with the good stuff that makes a fruit cake really great so i re ordered in christmas of what a disappointment i ordered one pound cakes when my order arrived i was so excited yes i like fruit cake only too be very disappointed not only where the cakes void of very much fruit unless you want too count the raisons as fruit i will not be ordering clayton fruit cakes next year i can get the same results from a hostess fruit cake and only spend instead of close to dollars for the clayton cakes
negative,27/2/19,claxton dark fruitcake has been a holiday tradition in our family since the mid s i ordered it directly from the company this year and when i served it at thanksgiving my guests and i thought i must have been fooled by a counterfeit website just claiming to sell claxton fruitcakes it was at best fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored cake i emailed the company and expressed my disappointment after several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners they assured me that it was the original dark recipe in reading the ingredients i noticed that corn syrup sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the th ingredient at the very end were listed molasses spices and artificial food dyes high fructose corn syrup wasn t widely available until the mid s to mid s so i m not sure how it was one of the original ingredients all of the people i talked to seemed to have the attitude that i was so stupid that i couldn t possibly be observing what i had correctly although they offered to send replacements if i returned it at my own expense they told me that what i would receive would be identical to what i have one of the owners informed me that they had received zero complaints this year i am grieving the loss of an almost year tradition but the other cakes are now in the trash
negative,19/4/20,aweful they arrived immediately and still were as hard as cement the bags supposed re sealable zipper didn t re seal once and maybe the large amount had something to do with it but again i cannot believe how stale and terrible the candy inside was
negative,17/4/20,get this type of sugar any other way than through ordering it because the shipping is insane the sugar is fine but for the price of the shipping it was not worth it
negative,3/4/20,i bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep my dog hardly touched the stuff and then i looked at the ingredients one of the first things on it was corn a grain known to because allergies in dogs as a matter of fact corn might be the most allergy prone food amongst dogs not to mention thanks to our friends at monsanto it is almost always genetically modified gmo or a franken food unless it s organic real premium dog foods brag that they ve no corn right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken by products another no no among real premium dog foods this means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it s not real meat cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it s cheap but it s not real meat a little further down you will notice bha an artificial preservative which again real premium dog foods do not have in short biljac is a joke it is basically insanely overpriced alpo with no organic ingredients whatsoever and uses all the shortcuts filler and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use don t be fooled by the old fashioned appeal of the company s years in business there is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap lousy ingredients calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a kia a mercedes for nearly the same price as this overpriced alpo one could buy organic dog food free of preservatives corn and cheap by products
negative,7/8/19,i am celiac and have been keeping a strictly gluten free diet for over six years and was excited to learn about this product after eating it the taste and texture was not bad i became sick in the way that i always do when ingesting gluten nana s also makes non gluten products and clearly are not careful about cross contamination if you are concerned about ingesting gluten or keeping a strictly celiac diet i strongly recommend you avoid this product i also think that the company should not deceive their customers many who suffer from celiac disease and should more clearly label their product as it is a danger to the health of many who would be inclined to buy this product
negative,9/3/18,the flavor is decent berry vanilla but i just can t handle the texture it s like a mouthful of sawdust that just disintegrates when you bite into it i ve been gluten free for about years and there are much better products out there my kids won t even eat these
negative,18/5/18,like other reviewers i rarely eat cookies because i have an anaphylactic response to wheat gluten therefore i generally love any cookies i m not allergic to these are an exception the taste is mild and fleeting the texture is like sand and leaves a dry feeling in your mouth the only purpose these cookies are good for is dieting because they are simply inedible blah
negative,27/1/19,i love the other nana s cookie bars and cookies so i thought i d give these a try even though they are no gluten and made with rice flour instead of wheat flour they look nice but the texture is a bit strange it s kind of like eating really fine sand and they are too dry and crumble at the slightest touch they don t taste bad which is a plus but i won t be buying these again
negative,10/11/19,these are so gross i can t believe i wasted my money on them they gave me an immediate migraine from the overwhelming artificial smelling fragrance i am not that picky an eater and i generally love any gf cookie just b c i am so grateful they exist but omg i immediately spit this out and rinsed out my mouth even my snack loving toddler didn t like these eating them that is she did have a great time massaging it into a fine powder which takes almost no effort at all what a mess and what a waste of money
negative,8/11/19,we have a gluten free household of no one in our family likes these my children are begging me to throw the box away i think they are afraid i ll sneak one in their lunchbox the cookie crumbles leaving a dry mess of rice flour and hardish chewy fruity bits in your mouth have a glass of water nearby if you try these i hate to leave a bad review but there are way better gluten free options out there i won t throw the box away i ll pass it on to another gluten free family i know and let them form their own opinion
negative,25/10/21,i was disappointed in the unpleasant flavor and dry texture of nana s chocolate munch cookie bars to me there was an odd artificial almost chemical like after taste in them that cocoa powder can t even cover up i threw away the entire box after tasting the first bar
negative,8/5/20,tastes like dry brownie w invisible pieces of puffed rice which get stuck in your teeth come on we can do better than this for cookie bars
negative,28/9/18,it s crunchy i m now love the smoother nana s like nana s no gluten lemon cookie ounce cookies pack of or nana s no gluten chocolate cookie ounces pack of you get the idea i hope i don t have coffee or chocolate anymore if you don t have a problem great but i found out i do
negative,29/7/19,this product is definitely not as good as some other gluten free cookies try pamela s
negative,9/3/18,i know what you re probably thinking they re vegan they re gluten free they re a dream come true the taste of these bars is very banana y but i doubt you ll be able to ignor the texture long enough to enjoy that the texture is akin to eating a handful of dirt i m no dirt eating pro but when i was trying to chew that s all i kept thinking please if you re thinking about trying these go down to your local natural foods market and pick up a box there first while you re at it you may want to get some of your favorite soymilk and lots of it ps if you re in the market for a yummy vegan bar try the betty lous brand the strawberry is super good
negative,18/5/18,i bought a box waist d my but people love me that i could give them this after having a bough of having to rush to bathroom i re read the posts and looked at ingredients closer gluten free whole grain dextrins if you don t have a problem great if you do you may end up re reading the s later i like the idea of bites had them before going to try out pamela s i love the nana s cookies but it s very hard not to eat the whole cookie the nana s no gluten lemon cookie ounce cookies pack of nana s no gluten ginger cookie ounce packages pack of it s two servings plus the texture is soooo smooth it go s down very easy i don t have coffee or chocolate anymore have green tea decaf need to go to the nana s banana bars modify or delete my post only bites i hope pamela s ginger works out for me i do love this too lundberg eco farmed honey nut rice cake ounce units pack of lundberg eco farmed buttery caramel rice cake ounce units pack of lundberg eco farmed brown rice cake salt free ounce units pack of
negative,17/5/20,be careful even though this is listed under gluten free section it is not gluten free
negative,26/3/20,after eating this product i had a stomach ache followed by hours on the toilet those of you with a gluten intolerance and celiac disease know exactly what those symptoms mean somehow this product is contaminated with gluten it is not gluten free please spare yourself the pain and suffering these cookies are not worth it for those of you who are tempted to continue eating this product even after you have been informed that it is not gluten free please keep these facts in mind if you eat gluten it damages your intestinal lining if you keep on eating gluten the damage to your intestines will get worse and so will your symptoms if you further continue to eat gluten you will end up in malabsorption increase your risk for intestinal cancer and lead to all sorts of problems including infertility autoimmune disorders oteoporosis in other words cheating on your diet is not worth it don t eat nana s products instead i suggest you buy something like pamela s chunky chocolate cookies they are one of my favorites
negative,24/2/20,i was a bit disappointed in these they crumble very easily and have an unusual texture my son does not like them
negative,3/5/19,i don t think i ve ever eaten anything drier than these cookie bars ever in my life they taste okay but i just can t choke them down even with coffee
negative,27/3/20,this device s lid does not seal i am not sure why it is being sold as anything other than a trashcan did work well for beer as long as it was transferred to a secondary right at the end of fermentation
negative,31/12/20,i m sorry to hear about the difficulty in finding the details about the hill s science diet savory chicken entr eacute e adult cat canned food on our website i checked our website and found that the item hill s science diet savory chicken entr eacute e adult cat canned food is currently only offered by the third party sellers on our website amazon merchants and marketplace sellers are independent third party sellers who offer a variety of new and used merchandise through amazon com when buying from a third party your order is fulfilled directly by the merchant as a result amazon merchants set their own shipping terms in general these charges reflect the handling costs for assembling and packaging each order as well as shipping costs products listed for sale by amazon merchant should be identical to the new items sold by amazon com with any differences noted in the description of the item s condition when you shop with an amazon merchant their merchant s shipping terms will apply to your purchase rates restrictions and methods vary from merchant to merchant and are not set by amazon com for instance while some merchants will ship to international destinations others do not you can always view details of a merchant s rates and policies from the product detail page of an item you re interested in buying and from the order form before you submit your order as amazon com doesn t handle the shipping of amazon merchant items you ll need to contact the specific merchant with any questions you may have before ordering they ll be happy to help answer your questions
negative,13/1/20,my kids love these fruit roll ups and i remember having them as a child so i was delighted when i saw i could buy a large box however when they came we were disappointed the were were very old and hard we only opened one and it broke into pieces because it s a food item you can t return which i think is ridiculous we couldn t even eat them i order lots of stuff from amazon and have had a great experience except for these fruit roll ups don t buy food from amazon the only reason i gave it star is because i had to click on something and they did arrive on time
negative,21/9/20,we have two dogs and after a few weeks of switching to the beneful healthy weight we ve noticed very unpleasant results they whine to go outside much more than they ever have and actually had bowel movements right in front of us if we don t get them outside in time our dogs have gone from needing to go outside a few times a day to or times daily to handle the number of bowel movements they have my theory is this dog food just goes right through the dog and not much of it actually is being utilized by the body which makes me wonder how many nutrients my dogs are actually receiving poor dog food in my opinion and should only be used if your dog needs a laxative i will most likely be going back to purina one
negative,2/12/20,i have noticed that my dog has had more frequent bowel movement than usual he is on a strict schedule for potty break and has been very good on it for the past years until i tried this food now he poops in my apt in front of us because he has to go so bad like the poster above its one hell of a laxative when my very well trained yorkie cannot even hold it in
negative,20/11/19,i bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat and with a name like beneful i thought i was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food my dogs did eat this food but after reading the ingredients i completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs the first three ingredients are ground yellow corn chicken by product meal and corn gluten meal how disgusting is that the main ingredient is a corn filler one thing my vet told me a while back that i never forgot when you eat corn what comes out of the other end the same thing happens with dogs basically dogs cannot digest corn it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full poop out more and retain less nutrients the only meat in beneful at all is a by product its not even a real meat by products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested we re talking beaks chicken feet eyeballs even chicken poop i would not recommend this product to anyone for any reason ever it is an absolutely awful dog food i can t believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising i recommend to stay far away from beneful and most purina products when purchasing a dog or cat food the most important thing to consider is the first ingredients just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself now that i know what to look for i usually buy my pets all natural organic foods such as blue buffalo halo or wellness
negative,2/12/20,i started giving my dog this a couple of weeks ago he really loved a different beneful and so i gave this one a try he loves it and is excited when its time to eat he would barely touch purina little bites i took him out of state to my mom s place and he pooped in the house times i took the blame for not paying enough attention to him however since we ve come back home he s pooped in my apt times in week he never does that i thought that maybe he was being spiteful but i really think he just can t help it the food is one hell of a laxative if that is what you re looking for i m glad i only bought the small bag because i will not be giving this one another try it only gets stars because he likes it and because i m sure he would lose weight if he keeps pooping this much terrible
negative,11/12/19,disappointed the big boxes had a very different flavor than the smaller boxes i am not sure why but not good
negative,20/11/19,this is a really easy way to make terrible iced tea sometimes convenience outweighs taste but not always what this product doesn t tell you before you buy it is that the ingredients are black tea with tea extract hibiscus and citric acid it s not just tea and it doesn t taste like just tea either it tastes like powdered iced tea from a jar it has an overtaste of lemon that s probably the citric acid and that fake tea flavor that comes from powdered iced tea mix i ll probably drink it when it s really convenient but i won t serve it to friends and i won t drink it if i have time to make a glass of real tea and pour it over ice
negative,28/6/20,not a big fan will not buy this again plus she eats it really quick too other than the throw up part
negative,8/8/20,the product was hard as a rock i could not even break it in half both dogs had hard time chewing them puppy could not either will not get product again unless the two packages i got were old and dried out
negative,14/7/21,we have a year old pug who will eat just about anything but these unfortunately he just would not go near them no matter how hard we tried to peak his interest
negative,2/12/20,i had high hopes for this product because it is healthy and affordable but neither of my chihuahuas liked it one just sniffed at it and walked away the other dog chewed on it for a short while and then walked away from it one dog likes nylabone nutri dent original minichews for mini dogs count pouch and the other dog likes bully sticks free range standard regular thick select inch pack by downtown pet supply i was looking for some alternatives that were healthy and more affordable i guess i ll be sticking with their current treats for now
negative,20/11/19,although some may like this drink it will not be a repeat buy for me calories for an oz serving is too much when that amount of orange juice is actually this drink isn t orange tangerine juice but a mix of juices secondly if this were unaltered juice seems you wouldn t have to add ascorbic acid to get of your daily vitamin c since that amount of orange juice naturally provides over perhaps the processing requires it but alas the biggest issue for me was taste it tasted to me like dishwashing liquid smells on the good side the carbonization is just right and the flavor is bold for those who seek that there is no sugar added and the non traditional taste is not overly sweet the taste may appeal to some but i m not a fan
negative,1/3/21,yeah it s gluten free and whatever but unless that s a really big issue for you and you re having trouble finding sugary drinks to enjoy on your gluten free diet there s no real draw to this drink over say orange fanta or any number of other carbonated juice type drinks i thought it was massively overly sweet and i have something of a sweet tooth the orange flavor wasn t particularly authentic or delicious and it left a sour aftertaste i got a free sample this time and i cannot see actually paying money to buy this product again on an environmental note packaging and shipping these things in tiny little cans makes for more waste and i don t appreciate that either not a fan
negative,5/5/21,switch is a tangy drink that s more reminiscent of sprite than orange juice it s carbonated all the way and you will even burp after it as you would ve after consuming any soft drink the drink doesn t feel sugary but a quick glance at the nutritional facts reveals that each can contains grams of sugar the claim on the can is that there are no additional sugars added so i m assuming that s the sugar from the orange and tangerine the can
negative,2/12/20,i ve become a fan of the switch sodas the black cherry flavor has a great balance of flavoring and carbonation that had me ready to give up traditional sodas the orange flavor however leaves a lot to be desired it has a really strong after taste and despite being juice it tastes like bad artificial orange flavoring i d opt for the grape or the black cherry for sure the switch black cherry ounce cans pack of also you ll want to note that the switch sodas aren t exactly healthy they are simply not overrun with artificial flavors they actually have a fairly high calorie count that being said they have some health benefits over pop like the vitamin count and no added sugars
negative,20/11/19,i could not finish this drink it is like drinking orange syrup it may not have any added sugar in it but one can of ounces has sugar grams and carbs i ll stick to water when i want to quench my thirst
negative,9/10/21,this product advertises that it is a soda made from fruit juices and is refreshing i was quite disapointed in the flavor if you have ever been unfortunate enough to drink canned not refrigerated or fresh squeezed oj you know there is a huge differance in flavor the bad almost rotting component is carried over into this soda it even carries a rather odd aftertaste i was not able to finish the entire can this may be a feature of the orange flavor other fruit flavors of this product might indeed taste good but i recommend skilling the orange version
negative,6/3/21,i did not find this drink anything special in terms of taste it is orange juice infused with carbonation the juice is quite acidic and you don t feel that there is fruit juice the drink comes in cans rather than glass bottle which would have helped the drink maintain the juicy taste longer it does not have any preservatives and it is gluten free no sugar and no artificial flavors this drink doesn t have any special features and it doesn t stand out well in a market crowded with many drinks izze fortified sparkling juice pomegranate ounce cans pack of minute maid mixed berry juice fl oz bottles fl oz cal valls certified organic juices clementine fluid ounce by igourmet com
negative,12/2/21,i have a tendency to avoid products with artificial sweeteners and this includes sodas with high fructose corn syrup the switch is a line of fruit juice sodas with no added sweeteners not even cane sugar it has carbonated water fruit juice some natural flavors and colors and vitamin c if you re going to drink soda carbonated fruit juice is the best way to go the switch has several flavors including orange tangerine however it s clear some flavors are better than others the orange tangerine has a harsh aftertaste that another flavor i tried does not i ve tried other citrus juice sodas and enjoyed them but something went wrong in the flavoring of this particular soda if you re looking for an orangey soda try izze s sparking clementine instead
negative,2/12/20,described as an alternative to soda switch is a carbonated fruit drink made from natural juices although not necessarily the ones listed as the flavor made mostly out of apple and grape juice the switch orange tangerine does in fact have an oversweet orange tangerine flavor followed by a strong vitamin aftertaste it tasted like drinking a soda made from crushed flintstone vitamins want a better carbonated fruit drink pour half a glass of orange juice and add club soda
negative,20/11/19,i like the idea of a healthy soda type drink but this flavor just missed the mark the tangerine overpowered the orange and left a bad taste in my mouth carbonated juice is a great idea they just need to tweak the flavors a bit ranking the switch drinks from best to worst watermelon strawberry kiwi berry black cherry orange tangerine
negative,25/6/21,the can says it s juice but the taste is powdery if you ve ever had a glass of kool aid or crystal light you ll know what i mean so there s that from powder taste also there is an aftertaste and all comes in a can the size of a red bull for calories i did not like it
negative,17/3/20,i m a fan of all natural anything especially when it s a tasty and healthy alternative to something i ve enjoyed my whole life but i know is bad for me regular soda is one of those bad things loaded with artificial colors sweeteners corn syrup yuck hardly seems worth the risk when i m also getting empty calories on average and now switch has come along true to its claim there s nothing artificial in it just juice sparkling water and other all natural ingredients that s great so i chose this particular flavor orange tangerine because i wanted the strong citrus taste i love this drink however failed to meet their promise yes i can taste the orangy citrus but as much i can taste the apple and grape juices used as well moreover this doesn t have that bold pop to it as other carbonated beverages have i ve had mineral water with more bite but the worse part about this good for me drink is in clocks in at calories the same as a regular can of coke and gcarb g sugar compared with coke at on the up side it has less than half the sodium as many regular colas and does deliver vit c and vit a but if i wanted those kind of health benefits i d rather take them directly from the source an orange overall the all natural health pros of switch orange tangerine simply don t justify the high calorie and carb count the switch beverage co may have done better to sell sparkling water with a twist of orange peel if they wanted to provide a truly healthy alternative to traditional sodas
negative,20/10/21,i have a big sweet tooth and thought i would really like this but it was too sweet even for me i even tried adding water but that didn t help i haven t tried any of the other flavors so i can t comment on the brand in general but i ll never try this flavor again
negative,21/7/20,if you think this is going to be a healthy product you are sadly mistaken it still contains g of sugar per can if you want to end up a fat diabetic by all means try it otherwise try the zero calorie zero sugar zero chemical naturally fruit flavored seltzers like those by la croix
negative,22/2/21,these are definitely not worth close to a dollar a piece if they were at my local grocery i might give twenty to thirty cents per can for them i didn t really like the flavor that well but if you did they might even worth up to fifty cents per can otherwise pass these up
negative,8/6/21,this had a nice citrus flavor but it was too sweet and actually flat i did not get any kind of fizz or sparkle for the amount of sugar and calories i rather would have eaten a piece of fruit and drank a glass of seltzer water less calories and more satisfying in my mouth i got this on gb special for about for the case i don t think i will purchase again
negative,2/12/20,i ve tried other flavors of switch carbonated juice drinks and have enjoyed them however this particular flavor of orange tangerine was way too sweet i felt like i was drinking some sort of carbonated orange ade drink and could barely get it down while i would probably purchase the other flavors of switch i definitely would not purchase this one
negative,20/11/19,i was anxious to try this but upon the first sip it was apparent to me that this drink was not going to go well for me it has a very sharp harsh citrus y metallic flavor and combined with the overwhelming sweetness the two seem to battle it out in my mouth for dominance after awhile it seemed like the drink was going down more like syrup more than a carbonated beverage the can is small at oz a regular sized pop can is oz and the cost of these little guys seem a little bit astronomical i also am a bit dubious of its attempts to seem like a healthy alternative to pop it still has loads of sugar in it so when they claim no additional sugar this may lead you to believe no sugar or low sugar but it does in fact have grams
negative,25/1/21,to me fruit juice in small cans are simply a staple first example that comes to mind is good old dole pineapple juice the trend towards trendy little health beverages in overpriced little cans is nearly tragic there is nothing about this product that would compel me to buy it if i want a soda i ll just grab one i don t drink enough of them to have much dietary impact and despite the claim of what you want there is nothing in here for me if i want of what i want i will buy a few oranges and some seltzer water if i want of what you don t want well why buy it this is a time when we had better look pretty closely at what is an indulgent convenience and what is a necessity and how to find a happy medium i consider the likes of pellegrino aranciata orangina and izze a luxury and when i indulge it is a true delight switch is a product that is not better tasting proven healthier or even less expensive than any of many other alternatives once again marketing is driving product creation and design and that is a hateful concept if you want a similar taste experience for about the same price pick up some alka seltzer cold plus nighttime you ll stop sneezing and sniffling and get a great night s sleep
negative,1/7/21,pros not overly sweet like some juice drinks no caffeine no corn sweeteners if that matters to you cons expensive for the size ounces can t taste the orange or tangerine juices in it lots of calories i grew up eating oranges and tangerines off my grandparents trees i was surprised that i couldn t taste those flavors in this drink but then i looked at the ingredient list on the can and those were the juices that were used in the smallest amounts probably to keep the cost down i ll stick to the sobe low cal drinks and the calorie vitamin water because they are cheaper and i d rather save up my daily allotment of calories for something with more flavor
negative,30/9/20,i grew up on orange sodas and thought this might be like a healthy crush that would be a no of course tangerine has a bit of a different taste than orange as it s that much sweeter adding the carbonation to it just made it an unappealing fizzy ultra sweet drink not unlike cough syrup proceed with caution perhaps kids would find it super tasty
negative,15/3/20,i didn t like this drink at all it had a very strange almost chemically taste to it i also didn t appreciate switch marketing itself as all natural but had ingredients like natural flavors and colors what are they are they even natural i even let my three year old try it but she couldn t even swallow it and spit it out in the sink too bad it would have been a good alternative to sodas but not with this horrible taste my daughter and i much prefer the ooba hibiscus drink
negative,6/7/21,i wrote a star review of the kiwi berry flavor that isn t usually my favorite flavor of anything but it was surprisingly good orange tangerine which would generally be among my first picks of fruit flavored beverages is flat by comparison literally it seemed to lack the right amount of carbonation it also tastes weaker and too sweet try the kiwi berry instead
negative,29/6/21,i thought it would have a clean crisp taste but it honestly tasted just like every other orange soda i ve ever had maybe that s deliberate maybe they re targeting people who would otherwise drink orange soda unless presented with a more natural alternative regardless it tastes exactly like carbonated reconstituted juice concentrates with some orange coloring thrown into the mix i e nothing special
negative,29/6/21,the carbonation in this drink was way too much so much in fact that it over powered the flavor orange tangerine is usually very good together i expect this from a soda but not a healthy drink lose some of that club soda bite and you have one delicious drink until then i ll pass
negative,26/7/21,this drink is very very sweet and only mildly carbonated i don t drink soda but i do occasionally like bubbles in my drinks i had some hope that switch would be a nice bubbly fruit drink to fill this need but it s not the ingredients may be all natural but it s still syrupy and has an odd aftertaste that i think is from the added vitamin c for regular soda drinkers the sweetness may not be as offensive but for anyone expecting something that tastes like sparkling fruit juice this will be a disappointment i d still choose this over an orange soda but i d choose to have nothing at all rather than this also note that the cans are only ounces each smaller than normal oz soda cans
negative,21/10/21,while orange juice is the fourth ingredient in this drink the dominant flavor is a muddy orange which is backed up by a low level of carbonation i think that the use of the inexpensive apple and white grape juices as the first two ingredients tangerine is third is what results in the unpleasant muddied orange taste finally they threw in a bit of acerola juice but to no avail to my taste this stuff is suprisingly unpalatable while the marketing suggestion is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely natural sugar in this or most any juice the healthy alterative to overly sugared fruit juices is to have a glass of cold water and a piece of fresh fruit fruit has less calories than juice but overall more vitamins minerals and fiber and a variety of natural antioxidants that most likely really are good for you
negative,25/10/21,well my husband myself and my year old son sampled this drink my husband hated it i felt like it was ok but nothing to write home about the taste to me was too orangey and for a natural product it sure didn t taste like one my year old liked it he also likes gummy worms and sour straws so you can take his review for what it is i personally wouldn t buy this product stars
negative,29/6/21,ouch this stuff is sweet as in really sweet this is really harsh tasting and we were disappointed most soda doesn t have this much sugar the oz can has grams of sugar yikes for a oz can of soda that would be like having grams of sugar who would drink that they need to water this way down we re going to end up giving the rest of this away we can t drink it
negative,5/7/21,when i saw the switch orange tangerine was available i knew i had to try it i liked the kiwi strawberry quite well better than some other reviewers did it seems so i was sure i would enjoy this one just as much the initial taste of this orange tangerine carbonated juice is rather tart and the carbonation just seems to make it more tart the aftertaste is rather pleasant so if the aftertaste is what you re looking for in a drink this is the drink for you my wife thought it tasted a bit like champagne if that s any indication of what to expect from this drink the flavor is different and not at all what i expected not very refreshing at all i would buy the kiwi berry drink but i think i ll take a pass on the orange tangerine in the future
negative,17/9/21,this was the most potent orange drink i have ever had it might be juice but this drink has some kick there are no artificial sweeteners in this drink but it is so highly concentrated that it was overwhelmingly sweet and even the tang of the carbonation couldn t cute into the sugary flavor it was way too strong for me and i thought it had kind of an odd aftertaste but if you like carbonation and have a powerful craving for orange tangerine this is the drink for you
negative,18/8/21,these seemed like a great idea i would be able to load up k cups with any type of coffee i chose and still maintain the speed of using the store bought cups in my rush to get ready every morning after waiting a month for this product to reach me days before they even shipped it i finally found it on my doorstep upon opening the box my hopes lifted even higher these are solid little cups of a much higher quality than i expected i filled one and snapped the lid down i ensured it was sealed all the way around placed it in my kuerig and hit the brew button at first it seemed to be working splendidly then coffee began pouring out of places it isn t supposed to by the time it was over i had quite a mess to clean up upon opening the kuerig i found the disposakup completely in tact and the lid still secured properly however the bit of overhanging filter was soaked dripping and hot i had discovered the source of the leak i have tried again several times with the same reoccurring problem i guess i should have bought the ecobrew cup after all if you like the appearance of convenience and the reality of spending more time cleaning up a mess this is the product for you i went ahead and gave it two stars because i like the idea of the product so much
negative,31/7/21,caused my cuisinart k cup brewer to leak every time i used it great idea just needs some adjustments so that the coffee maker works properly with it
negative,18/10/21,the lids do not fit coffee runs out of the pod a total waste of money there are other filters on the market that are much better
negative,29/6/21,i will start by being kind it is a good idea to save money with an item or concept like this it makes good sense to use your own coffee beans and avoid the cost of the pre filled commercial k cups you buy at the store now i received my disposakups over a month after ordering them and put them to use i was immediately disappointed filters did not hold very much coffee it was a struggle to get the lids to fit together with the filter and outer plastic cup the coffee was very weak this product actually creates more waste in a landfill than the commercially made k cups the body and lids are plastic normal k cups do not have a plastic lid notice they say disposable so put them in the trash they are not recyclable landfill they are not convenient they are a bit messy a pain to put together and still expensive not worth it there are better alternatives out there that will save you money make better coffee and not go into a landfill sorry i wish i had better news i think i will return these
negative,16/9/21,for product to work properly imho you need coffee ground as fine as possible once filter has been inserted plave carefully leveled measure of coffee in it manuever lid into place then press down on center steadily w thumb plan to use no more than oz of water for your cup removal of used cup from machine is occasional problem jiggle it and it will generally loosen up
negative,24/8/21,the products lid stays attached to the needle on the keurig allowing coffee grounds to fall everywhere very messy if this didn t happen it would work well
negative,24/6/21,these cups were difficult to cap putting the lids on securely was a comedy show and they created a mess when used in the keurig the water went everywhere add together pia and mess with an end outcome of weak cup o joe i m not a very happy buyer
negative,27/9/21,the lids are impossible to secure this purchase was a complete waste of money product cannot be used as lids are unable to be secured
negative,29/6/21,i ordered the disposa kups with the thought of making my own kups they don t fit together without a big production the lids won t fit and water comes out the top of the brewer lid as well as the kcup just a big mess not what i wanted at all want to return them and get a refund donna phillips
negative,5/8/21,first of all i thought i could save money filling my own keurig k cups by the time i bought the fillable cups paid shipping and bought coffee to put in them i was already in the hole if all you have to do is fill these little cups all day i guess it will work for you because you can have the coffee of your choice the other problem was is they get stuck in the brewer when you try to take them out i still have about thirty left and when they are gone i will not replace them
negative,29/6/21,i thought these would be the perfect answer sadly i guess the pressure with which my keurig machine shoots the water through the k cup is too much for the disposa cup because every single time i tried it coffee grounds were spewed up through the tiny hole in the lid of the disposa cup all over the inside of where the k cup sits in my keurig and yes i used them properly so the issue at least in my keurig machine seems to be with the lids some have suggested its a design flaw with the keurig machine in either case these disposa cups were not the answer for me biggest waste of money ever i cannot recommend
negative,31/7/21,the service and delivery from amazon was great however the product itself is not worth buying no matter what i try coffee leaks out around the kcup when brewing it makes a mess wanted the cups to use my favorite coffee tim hortons but guess i ll just have to get used to other brands
negative,11/9/21,the lids keep popping off when the cup fills up with water the only i have not tried is putting holes in bottom of the cup so that the water might flow out faster it s a damn mess getting coffee grounds in your cup i would not buy anymore of them unless i can fix the problem no more disposebale k cups for me
negative,12/8/21,i was anxious to try these cups since they seemed to be sealed like the original k cups but was very disappointed in the product though the cups came with no instructions it was apparent that you just put the filter in add coffee then pop the lid on trouble is the filters size and shape indicate they should hang over the outside edge of the cup but when doing that i found it impossible to seal the cups so i had to tuck the filter inside to be able to close and seal the lid after doing that and trying the coffee ran very slow though the k cup and after only about three cups the keurig machine seemed to get clogged up and stop working i cleaned out with vinegar and tried again but same result i ended up throwing these away as it didn t seem worth the effort to return them not a good product
negative,31/7/20,these k cups have damaged something causing the water to not come through my already made k cups i now have to put a ready made in and puncture it then open it and turn the k cup and puncture it again for the water to come through i think the material in the disposable k cup is too heavy and damages the needle on the bottom
negative,13/6/20,the basic problem with this product is that unless you load a very small amount of coffee in the filter the filter clogs this causes the coffee ground and hot water to back up through the hole in the top and because a mess my son and i spent a few hours experimenting with different ways to prevent this but we have admitted defeat i suspected the filter but i used filters which work perfectly fine in my ez cup still result in a mess on my kitchen counter even worse coffee grounds in my coffee however if you like your coffee very weak this will work well for you i hope they can fix the design issues until then i will stick with my ez cup
negative,31/7/20,thought this might be a nice alternative to use with my favorite coffee but was sadly disappointed it leaked all over no matter what we tried and the coffee was weak machine clogged with most attempts and water wouldn t brew thru at times the cup even melted a little leaving a nasty taste in the coffee go with the greener alternative and try the ekobrew much better results and no waste
negative,13/6/20,i purchased this item as an alternative to traditional k cups in an attempt to save money however this product did not work well in my machine i followed the directions and read reviews to see what works best but was not able to use the k cups effectively the cup itself is too weak and warps in my machine i compared the shape before and after and there is a big difference this k cup seems to expand horizontally and vertically because the plastic is not strong enough also the k cup is shaped differently from the traditional k cup this is neccessary because it does not use foil as a topper but does not seem to work in the end i had to clean up several coffee explosions in my kitchen to figure out how it works but still could not use it effectively maybe i am not doing something correctly but i m sure there is also an issue with the product itself while i do like the idea i would not suggest purchasing this product until the bugs are worked out
negative,26/9/20,well at least they live up to their name these nuts are definitely hot too bad that s all the positive i have to say about them other than that they taste like cardboard and not very good cardboard either
negative,17/10/20,made in china even our dog food has gone the way of the hershey kiss i won t be back to this vendor will be looking for made and sold in america only
negative,14/12/20,i eat mixed nuts all the time at work they make a healthy snack instead of the donuts etc that are always around the plus side of these is that they are much lower salt than usual the down side is that they are almost all cashews very few brazil nuts pecans and it is a miracle to find a macadamia nut the lack of variety is disappointing
negative,29/5/20,the price was comparable to walmart for same size product however these nuts were not as crunchy and they needed a little more salt
negative,9/12/20,i would recommend not buying these nuts if you are looking for some really good tasting nuts these are just average quality and the brazil nuts taste just plain awful the only good tasting nut in this lot is the almond and pecans there are barely any pecans but tons of cashews try another brand as i am sure there is something better out there
negative,4/8/20,these are a cheap fake nothing like the real emerald nuts you buy in the store its a complete waste of money do not get ripped off like i did
negative,31/7/20,good quality product but you would have to really love curry flavor to like these they are so awful i don t know what to do with them but i know i won t be eating them i ll stick to the plain sea salt ones
negative,13/6/20,unfortunately i am completely disappointed with this product i have an above average sense of smell but this extract has hardly any detectable flavor in the bottle and none whatsoever once added to food perhaps i received part of a faulty batch the seller is letting me return the bottle but is requiring that i pay for shipping again so i would be very unlikely to order from them again
negative,21/11/20,lacks the flavor i was hoping for and the price was a bit high for the satisfaction level i won t be ordering this again live and learn
negative,25/5/21,all of the positive reviews led me to believe this popcorn was going to be really great truth is i am disappointed the popcorn kernels are tough chewy and lack any great corn taste i want popcorn that snaps when you bite into it i will go back to buying the premium orville redenbacher s brand at my local grocery
negative,25/5/21,so far i m not impressed with this popcorn it s tender when popped but it s really annoying how much doesn t pop i m going to add a little water and then let it sit closed up for a while and see if that helps as of right now i wouldn t buy this popcorn again
negative,20/1/21,these are supposed to be cherry and brandy filled chocolates if they contain brandy it is too subtle for me to detect a clue to the because may be the stickiness of the package and the cracks in the candies it appears they were mistreated at some point and may have leaked but the box they came in shows no damage a friend speculated that airline decompression burst them maybe but other imported chocolates don t suffer this problem i should also mention that the chocolate tastes a little bit dusty on the outside i can t really recommend these laroshell candies there are other brands which are quite good
negative,15/1/21,i do like the idea of these crackers for gluten free eating but i can t bring myself to enjoy them i bought the pack variety and have tried the maple cinnamon and the onion garlic i generally like flax but these just aren t setting well with me even when i use them as a carrier for dips i feel i wasted my money i ll probably give the unopened packs to a friend s family that are gluten free
negative,8/2/21,i bought a bottle of tapatio hot sauce for my friend to have it shipped over to her in the east coast the order said it d take business days it ended up taking over weeks
negative,10/2/21,i bought this item thinking it might be equivilent to starbucks or davinci hazelnut syrup but it s not at first it tastes like hazelnut then you get the flavor of cheap pancake syrup followed by an aftertaste that can best be described as tasting stale the price is only slightly better than what i can get the davinci brand at sam s club but the quality is far lower in my opinion for hazelnut fans i suggest avoiding this particular brand
negative,9/10/20,i m sorry i bought this brand it leaves a lousy after taste in your mouth no wonder amazon is giving cent shipping on this item stay away avoid
negative,31/7/20,the flavor of big train hazelnut is not significant one has to add a lot to have a flavor impact of the three big train flavors i purchased including vanilla and irish creme hazelnut is the least satisfactory vanilla s a little better irish creme is best i gave that one stars
negative,13/6/20,very disappointed not much pumpkin or spice just pretty close to plain old coffee i was hoping for something like they have at tim horton s but its not even close
negative,5/12/20,the ones i received were mostly yellowish in color with some light green instead of dark green dry and somewhat stale they may have been in a warehouse longer that they should have
negative,1/11/20,i ordered the month ice cream of the month club for my wife s birthday she received her first shipment today and none of the ice creams that were sent matched the sheet they included explaining the ice creams you could have bought several of the ice creams such as butter pecan or mint chocolate chip in your local grocery store when i called the number i was told that occasionally they reserve the right to change the ice cream if it doesn t meet their quality guidelines when i told her none of the four ice creams that we received matched the overview sheet from amazingclubs the customer service rep was rude and told me that i needed to call back and talk to someone in their support group note you must call before pm est to speak to someone in this group i would seriously caution you to she will out more than for this club
negative,14/1/21,this is simply a mix of brown sugar and splenda i am sure it would be cheaper to make your own
negative,6/6/21,these are not black winter truffles tuber melanosporum i thought the price was too good to be true even though they aren t fresh and it is these are tuber indicums it says so right on the label i was very angry about this but jr mushrooms has said they will refund me for the truffles and even let me keep them so i give jr credit for excellent responsiveness and customer service although i still feel they should not be labeled black winter truffles
negative,21/7/20,i though this product lack flavor as i taste different brands far better there were no real flavor as i expected sorry
negative,5/1/21,we tried these and they were bland and had no redeeming qualities we sauteed them slightly and also tried them as is shaved the price as some have mentioned reflects what you get for truffles spend your money on white truffle oil you ll be much happier we are also wait for the white truffles to come in from italy i would not knock jr as a company but would not recommend this offering
negative,23/1/21,i ordered this in the past and was extremely disappointed they are unlike truffles that i know of they were hard like a huge seed had no truffle aroma i threw all contents out will never order them again
negative,31/7/20,i should have listened to the negative reviews but hoped that the positive reviews would ring more true there was veery little truffle flavor that got entirely lost in the risotto i made i agree with the other reviewers in that this was woody and flavorless not worth even this price for truffles
negative,13/6/20,little lesson on truffles truffles graded extra are larger than most the second highest in truffle quality best when used at the conclusion of the cooking process to release all their aroma and perfume chefs suggest to slice or shave thinly over pastas risottos and omelets whole entire truffles are marked brushed which means they have been cleaned of any soil or dirt preserved in brine or truffle juice which can be discarded or use to flavor sauced or broths and are ready to use preserved truffles are a nice budget friendly way to add visual truffle appeal to dishes however if you are looking to add the pungent aroma and taste of truffles to your dish chefs recommend that you explore fresh truffle selections jarred or canned truffles sold by vendors are mere shadows of their fresh truffle selves and will not by themselves deliver the aroma or flavor of fresh truffles they are great to use with truffle oil the oil will add the flavor the preserved truffles the truffle look but preserved truffles should be used only to garnish a dish or in conjunction to truffle butter and oil during those times when fresh truffles are out of season or when the budget doesn t allow for the real thing note preserved truffles out of the jar or can have almost no flavor or odor if you are looking for the true flavor of a fresh truffle then please go to seek fresh truffle pages online and purchase a fresh truffle if you re looking to add a truffle look only to your dish then this is the product for you better to buy real truffle oil experiment for example jr mushrooms specialties on amazon is a good start about dollars is low commitment that is in line with a superior bottle of extra virgin olive oil evoo
negative,1/12/20,zero stars for this item i couldn t even confirm that the wrinkled little animal offal sort of thing is a truffle this lacks any aromatic attraction at all i d be afraid to put it in anything i planned to eat for fear it would ruin the entire item as for the famous jr service my complaints about this product have been ignored
negative,30/1/21,i am the biggest fan of mushrooms you ll ever meet but these are really disgusting they taste like dirt i have to imagine better quality truffles if these are even truffles at all are muuuuch better they d have to be there d be no comparison these are really bad
negative,1/1/21,these truffles are not as great as they are made up to be i thought for the price they would have a greater taste but they didn t have much taste at all they are not worth the price but had to find out for myself i will not be buying truffles again and i m not going to spend over for a fresh one
negative,11/1/21,this is the worst flavored coffee i have ever tried there is no aroma or flavor of chocolate raspberry to this coffee bean at all in fact the coffee tastes sour i too am sorry i couldn t buy just lb to try it first now i am stuck with this awful coffee i cannot return so buyer beware no returns
negative,31/7/20,check out the nutritional info the sodium grams of your daily requirement i used this and our casserole was ruined because it was so salty and what s up with that price my box cost a dollar unfortunately i bought two boxes so i m throwing the other box away no bargain here it is wildly un delicious and un healthy for you yeah i m embarrassed that i didn t read the label first
negative,13/6/20,the product was okay but the color was very different than advertised it was a darker pink not red at all i tried to use it a couple different ways and as a relative beginner i did not find the product easy to use i tried mixing in with a little vanilla extract in order to paint it on i had read this was the best way to do it i found that the painting was very streaked and not very consistent maybe someone more experienced will be able to use it more effectively in the end because the red color was important for the cake i mixed it with red food coloring instead of vanilla extract the pearl dust used this way had just a little impact on the color not a great deal in the end i would have experimented more on the best way to use it if the color had been more red but as was i didn t find it super useful and will be unlikely to purchase again i hope that other people have a better experience as i very much like the idea of the product
negative,14/1/21,i have placed two orders for the weber grill grinder roasted garlic herb in the past i was so disappointing the last time i picked up my order as it was not what i had ordered it was citrus twist with garlic i just love the garlic and herb grinder and have given my first order away to my family as christmas gifts i now don t even have one bottle for myself you can see i have reordered the garlic herb and hope i will receive what i have ordered it would be so inconvenient to repackage and return if it was possible to buy it in my location i would but it s not available very disappointed leona the order that i received with the citus garlic was as follows transaction date location amount reference number description amazon com amzn com billwa
negative,7/12/20,second time i have reported this one jar broken and order not what pictured jam same but jar different i know my ginger this not same
negative,5/5/21,tastes burnt roasted slightly rotten sunflower seed taste gritty bland no salt sugar only seeds would not eat if it was free
negative,23/11/20,this is twice as expensive as basic box mac and cheese it is just so so in taste if you check the ingredients it is not much different than other mac and cheese the cost does not justify the ordering i will not be ordering from amazon again the cost is much cheaper at a big box chain
negative,29/8/20,i have been disappointed with this product we have always enjoyed annie s products have never had a problem until now the cheese was so solidly clumped that i was unable to make a sauce without lumps i have used different packages from my order have had the problem with all of them i am not sure if it is the result of a manufacturing issue or if they have been sitting on a shelf too long in the warehouse either way beware
negative,18/1/21,i love annie s but this had no taste very bland and unappealing i would not purchase this again but worst of all i m stuck with boxes boo
negative,18/6/21,i bought a new bread machine and bought this collection of bread mixes as well as some single mixes to try it out the single mixes worked well as they included yeast packaged separately in the mix my machine states clearly not to get the yeast wet to put it on top of the flour away from the water the mixes in this collection have the yeast in the flour not packaged separately the bread failed to rise at all why would they package the yeast separately in the single mixes and not in the multi packs along with the heartland collection i also purchased the baker s choice collection i am throwing them all out don t waste your money
negative,18/6/21,the bread has a good taste but does not rise properly and only makes loaf i checked the temp of the water as suggested with bad results after raising the temp to degrees i got it to rise to loaf pretty expensive for the quality and i won t buy again
negative,7/7/21,i bought this because the ingredients seem to be ok but for some reason it made my dogs have to go outside at least times each night overnight for the weeks we gave this to them we changed back to origen a food they do well on and the middle of the night bathroom trips stopped in days also my older dog tends to get really diggy when she is eating something not good for her and with this food she was constantly digging at the couch i have no idea what is wrong with this food none of the ingredients stand out to me as being the because but something in it really messed my puggies up
negative,18/6/21,the problem with this peanut butter is the use of evaporated cane juice which is a coy way of saying raw sugar accent on the sugar the sugar is gritty and overpowers the peanut taste and the maple it wasn t very maple y it was gritty sweet and pretty much not great maybe the cane juice crystallized to the low moisture content of peanut butter anyway it was a loser i had heard much hype about this peanut butter started by someone who has a peanut butter sandwich restaurant in new york i happen to like pbj and celery with pb a tablespoon of peanut butter is a fairly good snack even if you are watching your food intake but this peanut butter is too sugary for my tastes i gave it two stars if you are making a confection or cookies it could be very good but as eat alone peanut butter i found it way too sweet and gritty for my tastes
negative,7/7/21,i just received the plant i paid extra for a quick delivery to secure the plant s condition it arrived on time however it arrived wrapped only in moist news paper without any protection for the plant the plant is completely smashed this was for me a complete waste of my time and money i paid more for shipping than for the item itself and it didn t do a bit of good very disappointing
negative,1/7/21,this plant appears to be dead on arrival i have had in full sun since arrival and its leaves and stems are pink and not growing at all ide order another one but it will probably die in the slow shipping as well for a dead weed no thanks they would not let me submit this review with out clicking a star not even worth one star note the picture they used for this product has six more branches than mine i have three
negative,7/7/21,ordered this plant to remedy a fruit fly invasion the amazon shipping was acceptable but the manufacturer does not create the packaging to facilitate any shipment unless they were to put this side up on the box the dirt was everywhere but where it was supposed to be and the plant audrey was upside down roots up in the box if i had found one locally i would have bought it there hoping audrey survives but i don t have high hopes edit audrey is now deceased do not recommend
negative,23/7/21,plant was dead on arrival and was mangled in its container probably better to buy one locally i do not think its going to make it
negative,20/7/21,the plant was upside down in the box and i had to put the roots back inside the planter it never came out of shock and turned black and died
negative,19/7/21,i had a second plant to replace the first one it to came in sad shape i should of went to a local nursery at least then i would of got a good plant do not waste your time with this vender
negative,18/6/21,the plant arrived dead it cost as much to ship i did not want to hassle with any kind of return i should know better than to buy a plant on line
negative,7/7/21,i received an undersized sickly plant that could not be nurtured back to health what was i thinking ordering a plant over the internet never again
negative,27/6/21,it only lasted days came mostly dead glad it was only bucks it was also very small so the flies i wanted it to eat it couldn t
negative,21/7/21,two of the three plants were dying and are now dead they all were tiny they are suppose to catch flies but not one fly has been caught because they couldn t even fit in the bloom rip off do not do business with this vendor
negative,18/6/21,i don t know how people could say this doesn t smell or taste bad it is horrible i was getting raw goat s milk for quite a while and when we moved it wasn t available the fresh raw milk was delicious and mild and did not have that gamey odor and flavor that this milk has maybe some people don t mind the taste maybe some acquire a taste for it and maybe some even like it but i think it is vile if you like the taste of the goat s milk cheese in stores then you may like this if not stay far far away
negative,7/7/21,the last shipment i received when preparing the milk there were black specks or particles in it it was in two out of the three containers i don t even know if it was in the first can i used this was the first time it s happened and i ve been using goats milk for my daughter since december and she loves it plus it didn t constipated her like whole cow s milk now i m leary about buying another batch as it may contain this stuff again
negative,30/6/21,too bad this stuff in general ranks high on the inflammation triggering foods i m trying to follow a low inflammation diet i do love the taste of goats milk it s very rich and creamy the liquid is better than the powder
negative,1/7/21,for boxes is this a rare item that s a box i think the item might be a bit overpriced
negative,24/8/21,i ordered two can packs of oz v juice which were boxed together and filled with inflated plastic to buffer when i opened the box although all the flip tabs appeared to be intact one can had leaked some of it s contents and the juice was all over the other cans and inside the box i weighed the cans to find out which one s had leaked and that s how i determined which one to throw away the weight of the cans varied but the variance was consistent except one can was a few ounces short i am hoping it was just from the one can and i don t turn up with salmonella down the road since this was a ups delivery i am kind of surprised that amount of pressure was put on this package usually get superior service from them i have ordered like this in the past and the product arrived in perfect condition so as i said i was disappointed this time
negative,21/7/21,i got this in the mail nice packaging and all opened it up to see its single serving bags oz of hot water to a bag not gallon size so i decided to make some and it tasted like the little pink bubble gum double bubble i used to get as a kid yuck so not what i was expecting
negative,25/6/21,i didn t order because it doesn t indicate anywhere what size the bottle is i think that s basic information maybe you should include that in your description
negative,13/9/21,wolfgang puck recently changed their chicken soup the old stuff is excellent the new stuff is watered down not filling and doesn t taste as good the image and description on this item stated that it was the old soup the soup i received is the new stuff being a food item returns are not allowed i feel this was false advertizing and am extremely displeased
negative,18/6/21,this soup has no flavor broth had a slimy consistency instead of a liquid y one i was so disappointed
negative,7/7/21,this soup is just offensive why does it taste like cinnamon also it s twice the price of campbell s and the chicken sure it says it s organic i totally believe that don t you
negative,15/7/21,i found this exact same product same size at our local grocery store qfc and safeway for so am not sure why this product is priced so much higher
negative,11/7/21,the tree is nice but that is the only part besides the pot did not come with a matching drip tray as promised instructions were lacking information and were merely a printed piece of paper
negative,7/10/21,what s in this stuff where s the list of ingredients i don t eat anything unless i know and approve of what s in it for example although this product s description says it contains no sugar it does not say if it contains any artificial sweeteners which are also bad for you for one thing aside from tasting awful artificial sweeteners often because horrendous intestinal cramps and diarrhea in addition to having long ago given up the eating of sugar and sugar in all its guises e g natural cane juice fruit juices raw sugar organic sugar etc i also stopped ingesting artificial sweeteners of any kind so what s in this stuff
negative,6/7/21,i have tried many different protein powders over the years and while it is hard to write a review based on taste alone since everyone s taste is different i m going to go ahead and say this is the most rancid tasting gunk i have ever had the displeasure of putting in my mouth i mix my protein shakes with a hand blender so i rarely have any mixing problems and even this protein mixed well the fun really began when i tasted it it tastes sour and acrid at the same time absolutely horrendous i could not finish the shake i had mixed up and had to wash my mouth out with apple juice to get that sick taste out before i could actually eat or drink anything else this is a terrible protein powder from the standpoint of taste in my opinion of all the types i have tried which is many this has taken seat as the new worst one fyi i had ordered this with another brand because i am testing egg protein powders due to casein sensitivity if anyone has an egg protein powder recommendation pm me
negative,18/6/21,so after comparing this to jay robb i can say that this protein is not as good the taste isn t as good and it doesn t mix that easy i don t think it is horrible just not that good one thing i like about the jay robb is that they use hormone free chicken eggs i sent healty n fit an email asking where they get their eggs from but they didn t reply it is a little cheaper but i found the jay robb at vitamin shoppe for per ozs which isn t bad i have to say that i don t like the dudes picture on the bottle but that s my only complaint
negative,7/7/21,the protein powder is ok not to good as i expected if you pour hot milk over it will will form substance like egg white which is very bad in taste not at all drinkable
negative,27/7/21,i used this product cod roe tarako spaghetti sauce to eat when i feel lazy at japan that very cheap and just boil pasta and mix this pouch because i ate that product once a week in japan after i moved here america year ago i really miss some asian food because little expensive but when i see picture i remind how good and excited because i bought this from amazon but taste little different i was disappointed too strong smell like a ocean i throw garbage because i did not remember product of japan america i never ever buy this in america
negative,13/7/21,this sounded so tasty from the reviews and the flavors were enticing so i ordered some we had some for breakfast today and then went to pack the other boxes in bags to go to the homeless shelter to us it is dreadful it has the texture of paste and not even palatable for us am throwing out the box we opened and canceling my order on subscribe and save when you consider how easy it is to make real oatmeal i m sorry i was fooled by these flavors
negative,13/9/21,i used quotes around the word tea because i doubt that the bags contain tea i wouldn t be surprised if the bags contained ground up sticks instead of tea i would not give this product a single star it deserves zero stars in my opinion this tool is not allowing me to continue without giving the product at least one star
negative,7/9/21,the grains make this food really flakey it just doesn t stick together and was falling off the spoon a major mess really it also doesn t have a zip lock top and i thought it did like many of the other pouch foods and took this with us out to dinner i ended up putting the leftovers in a plastic baggie my baby also was not a fan of this at all and she is not a picky eater even my dogs turned their nose up at it and i thought it tasted pretty nasty
negative,17/4/21,sent this to my mother to help her out with groceries since she is on a fixed income she said it was horrible and would be throwing the other boxes out so i would not reccomend this product
negative,10/3/21,i had pretty high hopes for the busy bone i have a large active chewer the kind of dog that has to have several bones to choose from all the time if you don t want her to chew up your bed frame i was hoping that with the busy bone s long lasting promise i might be able to just give her one of these and at least have time to wash the dishes why don t i describe what happened next i was in the kitchen washing the dishes it had been about fifteen minutes since i d given the dog the bone deeply absorbed in annoyance with myself for not rinsing said dishes i was scrubbing vigorously when an awful sound met my ears a terrible and hauntingly familiar crunching noise the dog was eating my bed so i go into the bedroom to scold her and even before i get a chance to look at the bed frame i am struck by the mess she has caused the busy bone somehow leaves little brown crumbles all over the floor too small and numerous to pick up by hand and too gushy for the vacuum cleaner to clean up the oobleck has to be washed out of the carpet with a dish rag and did i mention that they re expensive i will continue to stick with real bones that i purchase from the butcher they re cheaper they last longer and they don t leave a terrible mess
negative,17/4/21,my dog demolished her busy bone in under minutes i think she basically ate it which was a huge disappointment we were hoping for something that we could give her that she would enjoy but also something that would last a bit longer in addition to being more of a treat than a chew these things are messy she had it all over the floor around her and all over her paws it makes a sticky goop that isn t very easy to clean up i definitely won t buy these again it s too expensive to only last minutes
negative,21/1/21,i write this letter after considerable thought and anguish on friday morning february i was awakened by the screams of my fianc eacute e lori as she sat on the living room floor cradling greta our year old registered female pug greta crawled under the coffee table and there choked to death alone on a purina busy bone i m left wondering how purina a company with a name as iconic as betty crocker bayer gerber and general mills could have not only manufactured such a lethal product but as i ve since discovered on the internet has had issues with it in the deaths of other dogs for some time and not pulled this dangerous item from the shelves i find this absolutely appalling i m years old and i ve put my trust in purina products since i was a child and now our beloved greta purchased from a breeder as an adorable puppy in the fall of is dead because of your product and lori my sweetheart of years a stroke victim in and who most certainly can do without this kind of stressful catastrophe a great animal lover has had her heart torn asunder she s simply devastated and angry and so am i did you know that in the united states its citizens spend more on their pets than their children are you familiar with the westminster kennel club dog show series which includes the world s finest breeds in competition for best in show including the chinese pug do you have any idea of the loss we ve suffered at your negligent hands i could talk about the money we paid for greta from the breeder and having her spayed we don t breed our beloved pets we keep them as loving companions for as long as we can and there are the regular check ups and shots and so on i find it bitterly ironic that the veterinary office we use is within walking distance of the kroger store from which we purchased your killing busy bone i have a year old father who lives alone i visit him at least twice a week sometimes more if time allows he certainly appreciates those visits but he also has a fulltime companion spencer his jack russell terrier spencer will turn in may dad is disabled uses a walker is scheduled for heart valve replacement surgery at the cleveland clinic and has a myriad of other health issues yet despite them he has managed to take very good care of his dog and i believe if it weren t for the loving attention spencer gives dad he would not be alive today his dog has given him something special the gift of life something which purina has stolen away from us you d think that purina would have the same consideration for the welfare of dogs in this country as a disabled year old man but tragically that s not the case yet there s more we also have a male pug which we named winston because he has the same tenacious bulldog features etched into his amazing face as that of winston churchill winston like greta was is truly an individual a soulful companion and like us he s now subdued he s actually depressed because his playmate has disappeared and he doesn t understand why this concerns me i am a professional photographer and writer by trade i work with the general public and i have to present a side to it which instills confidence writing by nature requires a certain state of mind as well as a result of losing greta all i can think about now is me handing her a busy bone not knowing that it would snatch her away from us forever a short while later the guilt is killing me how can i write how can i do anything grief passes they say but tragic memories remain fixed for a lifetime and what makes things worse in this case is that greta s death could have been prevented though both winston and greta liked the busy bone several times in the past greta had gagged on it so i served her a smaller portion each time which after careful observation i assumed resolved the problem in retrospect i should have responded more to the concerns lori expressed over this potential danger to begin with in a brief moment while we were in another room greta died because of your product and why should such a product even exist why wasn t it at least labeled as a choking hazard why didn t purina conduct the adequate safety research before releasing this product to the stores the answer is self evident gross negligence a negligence which has caused the death of not only our beloved greta and other dogs but has now indelibly left its mark in lori s and my life we ll never be able to erase the painful images seared into our minds of her lying still on the floor i lie awake at night thinking about it now as well as remembering digging her grave in our backyard through such anguish that even i a writer cannot express in words it s now the closest we can get to our special friend we are utterly distraught greta only years old healthy and in her prime a wonderful loving companion is gone forever it s a horrid loss that cannot be replaced thanks to purina the very least purina can do is pull all forms of the busy bone from the market immediately and to conduct adequate responsible research in the future before releasing any purina product karl and lori former owners of beloved greta purebred female pug our baby gone forever
negative,30/1/21,i had used this frequently on and off over the years and didn t realize that it is not sold in the us any longer in the past the instructions were in english on the packet but i don t recall what they were now it is entirely in german and no one i know speaks a word of the language i don t have a scanner so one of the solutions suggested won t work don t buy before realizing that if you don t speak german and have no one to translate you are in a pickle i have packs now another thing all packs expire in months time so don t buy in bulk unless you plan to eat a lot of sauerbraten rated only because i am unable to use the product and the product description does not mention either the language issue or the near term expiration date
negative,13/2/21,i would we willing to try this product and have six envelopes in my cupboard but unfortunately the instructions are in german maybe i can hire an interpreter
negative,15/1/21,arm hammer s baking soda is aluminum free they just don t write it on their packaging i wasn t sure so i called them and they said there is no aluminum in it and they would have to state it if there was because people take the product internally this leads me to believe that there just isn t aluminum in baking soda and researching it showed me that there might have been in the past but not anymore and not for a long time i resent that bob s red mill writes aluminum free on their package and then charges a premium for their product it s also arsenic free i hope if they label it arsenic free will we assume other brands aren t i don t like that kind of marketing
negative,6/3/21,all baking soda is aluminum free this is an unnecessary marketing ploy to get you to buy their product buy this because it is naturally mined and is cruelty free but do not be duped into thinking that good ole arm hammer has aluminum in it by the way the chemical process used to make a h is almost exactly what occurs in nature just faster but not cheaper it costs no more to mine sodium bicarbonate than it does to manufacture so yes you are paying for a name
negative,8/6/21,i just called bob s red mill customer service just do a g search for the company their customer service number is under contact us on their site and i was annoyed to learn that none of bob s red mill baking soda contains aluminum i ve been paying with shipping for this magical aluminum free baking soda only to learn that the bob s red mill premium baking soda at my local grocery is the same exact thing call for yourself if you don t believe me ugh
negative,7/1/21,i was very unhappy when this package arrived at my workplace the bags were not wrapped for shiping and was damage in route when i opened the box the baking soda was spiling all over the place i could not identify where the many holes were and did not have acess to a container to put them in so i threw it away i made a mess all over the place what a waste i will not be ordering from this company again
negative,17/4/21,what constitutes a good coffee is rather subjective you can read countless reviews about it but you don t know until you ve tried it for yourself having enjoyed peaberry coffee i think the spherical shape results in better roasting from many different parts of the world i gave this a shot based on the positive reviews posted and the great price boy was i disappointed the beans are light medium in roast has a mild subdued smell the beans looked dry but this is not uncommon for light roasts i made a fine grind of the beans and brewed it in a press sad to say it was the most disappointing cup of coffee i have had in a long time the flavor was stale without any fruity characteristic of peaberries and reminded me of a cheap cup of joe from a dirty diner the worst part is i am stuck with lbs of terrible coffee that cannot be returned amazon does not accept return of food items
negative,10/3/21,my reason for the low rating is that there was no use by date on the bag making it difficult to know if the beans were old and not well cared for or if that s just the way tanzanian peaberry beans roast up not sure how a manufacturer gets away without putting a date on their products but this supplier has found some way to get around it the coffee does taste good although a hint of staleness exists but the beans are totally dry no oil no moisture is present when they are ground i ve enjoyed peaberry coffees from hawaii for years peaberries are the best of the best beans i ve also come to enjoy african coffees for their full yet mild taste so to find peaberry coffee from tanzania at such a great price was too much to pass up i expect to finish up the coffee i ve purchased but probably wouldn t buy it again or buy any coffee from this supplier since i have no assurance of its freshness
negative,14/1/21,i rarely post a product review but i feel that i would be irresponsible as a consumer if i did not comment on the tanzania peaberry whole coffee beans i had high hopes when purchasing this coffee and i did my best to tolerate them to illustrate i have consumed almost one whole bag of the three but will have to dump the other two in the trash the beans are stale dry over roasted with little flavor even loading up the coffee with sugar does not seem to help i resolved that this morning would be my last cup i will have to resort to buying the eight o clock brand at my local grocery store i even briefly considered giving the two unopened bags to a friend but decided that it wasn t worth alienating him coffee bean direct you need to do better much better
negative,24/5/21,regular reduced fat milk from horizon received slightly over a month away from the expiration date my intention was to buy whole milk but the product description is confusing i sent an email to the customer support no response after weeks i checked and found that they made the picture larger good but left the product description without change as for me it is crazy expensive shipping while i can get same fat free or reduced fat milk at stopnshop or market basket the difficult thing is to find whole milk funny that whole milk as natural product became unpopular i guess too many people are concerned about becoming overweight
negative,14/10/21,once again i find myself trying to like tazo herbal teas but they keep putting licorice in teas where is just doesn t seem to belong to me anyway this is another example where i expected a lovely flavored tea and the licorice flavor is so strong it s just about all i can taste i guess i ll just give up on tazo who ever blends all their teas has radically different taste buds than mine
negative,7/2/21,this tea was not what i expected i love cinnamon tea and was very disappointed with this product the tea does not have a strong cinnamon flavor which i enjoy this tea has a stronger rooibos flavor than cinnamon flavor furthermore i found that the product description does not give a full list of the tea s ingredients the ingredients listed on the box include cinnamon licorice root orange peel indian sarsaparilla chicory root rooibos natural flavors star anise almond extract and locorice extract
negative,29/3/21,wow very weird taste i typically like all the ingredients but this mix just tastes wrong it s somewhat similar to sarsaparilla tea but with a licorice aftertaste it isn t so bad that i couldn t finish the first cup but not my cup of tea
negative,17/4/21,well i bought this item before and enjoyed it immensely pink salmon is very good for you this time i ordered again received albacore tuna instead of pink salmon amazon does not do returns on groceries such as these even if not opened that i can see i sent personally an email to raincoast trading company based in canada also left a phone message as well delayed response but finally got emails and they were courteous but they redirected me to try help center to get credit and get the correct item gone through hoops in the help center of amazon to no avail until i found the toll free amazon phone number amazon llc confirmed they can not accept the return but will send the correct item promptly we shall see awaiting a replacement item a minor complaint they are smaller can sizes than the normal pink salmon i am used to ordering anyone want some tuna o well p s updated review sept th i finally got the ordered item partly because the amazon rep corrected it when i called in and sent it fast by the way it cost me a toll call to canada to the company without a prompt reply that just added insult to injury well i was able to order from a different merchant through amazon thank you amazon for coming through
negative,10/3/21,i purchased this product to lure black bear to the bait pile the product has no sweet smell as one would expect i have asked for a refund or exchange from the supplier no response
negative,10/7/21,i got sent the wrong item which happens i know i tried to contact the company multiple times with no response i finally had to contact amazon and they are returning the item for me
negative,27/1/21,my cat has an iron stomach she can eat absolutely anything and everything and is always getting into my human food and has never thrown up i gave her of these treats and within minutes she was wheezing and throwing up all over my carpet i didn t connect it at first but when i gave her the same treats the next day exact same reaction i have tried several different flavors of this same brand and she has had the same reaction if you are trying these with your cat for the st time only give them of them and just wait to see how they react before you give them anymore
negative,1/6/21,both of my cats age threw up for an extended period after eating just of these into the trash they go not the cats the treats not sure what they were reacting to but thought it would be good to let other cat parents know the risk
negative,20/8/21,my sweet little persian looks like she is dying she s been puking all night because of these treats how has this item not been recalled
negative,14/8/21,i have two cats my big boy has eaten these and never had a problem as a matter of fact he has never vomited or had a hair ball since i adopted him at months my girl cat throws up every time she eats this particular flavor since i treat them equally these are no longer purchased i hate to see my girl sick so i just recommend you watch your cats after you give them these treats if not a problem carry on
negative,21/4/21,i ve tried it with both my cats several times every time they eat this and other whiskas temptations products they vomit within minutes they love it they want it it s cheap but it makes them puke so i d consider this a bad purchase
negative,1/4/21,i don t want anyone to think this is an unfair review of the product it s more of a warning from my own personal experience so others don t make a mistake when i got my new kitten from the humane society they sent him home with a goodie bag that happened to include these treats i started feeding them to him and he seemed to like it then i noticed he would vomit occasionally it was only after closer inspection did i realize these treats are for cats months and older i m sure there s a reason for this they caused his vomiting i switched to a different temptations medley and he hasn t vomited since so keep in mind there is a reason they limit these to older cats they really aren t kitten safe i only wish my humane society realized this before sending them home with him i can only imagine they feed these to all the cats in their care without reading the package
negative,17/4/21,i finally did the research on this temptation treats and i m glad to see that my suspicions are correct i have been buying this treats for my kitty for years and suspected them all along to be the because of him vomiting ironically i even bought the hairball ones to see if they would make him stop vomiting now is official i stopped giving them to him as often and then monitored him whenever i gave him any it soon became clear to me that he only vomits whenever i give him this treats sometimes he would vomit within minutes and other times he would vomit during the night or the next morning but if i give him this treats i m sure to be cleaning up orangee throw up off my carpet soon after i think is a matter of allergy or sensitivity to one of the ingredients and they probably don t do anything to other cats but i m never buying this again for my kitty
negative,10/3/21,you know i was searching the internet for the words temptations and vomit when i came across these reviews i was surprised to hear that i m not the only one who has had problems with this product within an hour of eating these treats my cat vomits for about minutes i didn t realize it was the because until the second time i fed them to her it s really bad because it doesn t because the cat to throw up all at once it s like she can just vomit a little at a time and you re forced to follow her around cleaning up all the vomit or locking her in the bathroom which is horrible
negative,22/4/21,i have fed my cats these treats the last days within minutes of eating them they are both throwing up i will be going back to the three dog bakery treats expensive but have never made my cats sick why is the company not responding to so many bad reviews
negative,25/4/21,i ve never written an amazon review before but this product was so horrible i had to warn would be buyers i can eat pretty much anything but i had to empty out both bottles it just tasted like colored sugar water very thin sickening sweet don t know if there was any onion flavoring the only reason i bought this is because i couldn t get ken s steakhouse vidalia onion dressing shipped in california so far the worst product i have purchased on amazon buyer beware unless you like sugar water then drink up blech
negative,1/4/21,does anyone realize tocopherol usually comes from soy i m still hunting for a cracker i don t have to make their website is unclear about it s source
negative,30/6/21,used for less then months both cats fur began falling out bad stopped using it the cats fur is back to fine back to feeding my cats nature s variety instinct i baught this petgaurd product at fairway market not amazon will not use it again
negative,1/3/21,i felt really good about being a good cat mommy and buying something of such quality for my sweeties too bad none of the would eat it no matter what i did donated it to the local spca maybe a dog will eat it
negative,29/1/21,this coffee brews very weak like a light roast w p chef s reserve pods are just over half full put pod on scale and it s less coffee wgt than normal pods stick with normal pods or extra bold if you like coffee that taste like coffee
negative,17/4/21,i wanted to like this coffee i did we ve tried other wolfgang puck k cups and have been pleasantly surprised this just did not impress us bitter aftertaste and it has an almost sickeningly vanilla flavor smells great while brewing but just does not live up to it in the cup i m really disappointed because i now have a box and a half of this product that we really do not want to drink great price though
negative,10/3/21,warning this is a strong flavor i thought that this would be blue mountain y oh no it is like rum flavored or something yuk
negative,30/5/21,nowhere in the description does it mention anything about this coffee being flavored i m still not sure what flavor it is some type of nut i wrongly assumed that jamaican coffee would be similar to the blue mountain coffee which jamaica is known for how silly of me to assume that i hate flavored coffees so i was so disappointed to now own boxes of such a horrible coffee it only says flavored very small on the box so i didn t notice it before i opened it hopefully i can pawn it off to visitors and buy some regular bold coffee flavored coffee for myself
negative,28/9/21,no where in the description does it mention that this is a flavored coffee by the name i thought it was a jamaican blue mountain blend but its flavored with a weak tasting hazelnut not very good
negative,6/5/21,i was in a hurry and did not read the reviews i trusted amazon s description and it did not indicate it was flavored coffee and that it was not jamaican it is very lightly flavored with vanilla so it is not too bad i feel cheated
negative,20/4/21,i thought this was a jamaican blend or roast but turns out it s simply a heavily flavored coffee the flavor tastes artificial like fake maple syrup flavoring we have three coffee drinkers in our house and none of us could get past the first few sips now i have to find a home for the rest of it so it doesn t go to waste
negative,20/4/21,i wish amazon would require any coffee with sweet artificial flavorings to be plainly identified as such then folks who really dislike coffee adulterated this way could avoid getting another disappointing flavored cup of coffee this stuff tastes the way i imagine newman s own extra bold coffee would taste with curdled spoiled bailey s irish cream dumped in it nasty shudder
negative,21/4/21,i drink about to cups of coffee every morning i m always looking for a new flavor so i gave it a try i drank it but i would not order again steve
negative,2/5/21,first of all i have owned a keurig for about years now and i ve tried lot s of coffee during that time i have had an occasion k cup that didn t function correctly and loaded the brew with grounds i probably should have returned these before i bothered to open the second box since i drink my coffee from a thermal cup i can tell you that taking that last drink to find your mouth full of coffee grounds stinks i have had to throw out at least cups of coffee its a bit like russian roulette and i ve started straining it after i brew it i know that its not my brewer because it is not happening with the green mountain timothy s or tully s that i also use the good cups are a bit weak for my taste but the flavor is ok definitely prefer not to waste s on a product with a manufacturing defect
negative,25/5/21,this was the nastiest flavored coffee i have ever had in kcups i purchase many different kinds of flavored coffee and caramel is my favorite but this one made me gag it smelled like buttery cheese and the taste was not what i expected i will stick to gloria jeans and timothys flavored coffees this was my first wolfgang puck kcup and will be the last i order of his brand i thought maybe i got a bad cup but i brewed and i opened the other box and tried those since it comes with two boxes and same nastiness
negative,7/9/21,i am not a fan of flavored coffee and i thought i had read the description of this product very carefully but nowhere did i see any indication that it was a flavored coffee i wish the descriptions of the coffees offered by amazon were clearer so that there is no confustion as to what you are purchasing even the name of the product is a little deceptive since one might assume that it is jamaican coffee
negative,25/5/21,i use to purchase jamaica beans locally and it was great this jamaica me crazy is nothing close to it the odor is terrible and it tastes like the coffee is flat or stale other people in household tried it and couldn t get past the first cup pitched the remainder cups in the trash
negative,22/5/21,this coffee tastes very flavorful and is not too strong but i have to say it almost ruined my months old keurig personal brewer the coffee is ground so finely that when the k cups are punctured by the needles top and bottom it gets packed into the needles and also sifts out through the holes made by the needles going into the coffee cup creating a very nasty sludge in the bottom of each cup i purchased a pack of k cups and didn t even use one full pack i do not recommend this brand or blend it is a waste of money which is something i couldn t really afford at this time i sent a letter of complaint to the wolfgang puck company and except for a cookie cutter letter acknowledging receipt of my comment i have not received any further contact from them
negative,19/7/21,unfortunately i m much too frugal to throw away something i ve spent perfectly good money on so i m continuing to use these suckers until they re gone hopefully in a few weeks i thought i was buying a decent brand of coffee given the wolfgang puck name but alas i was wrong using the middle cup size on my keurig coffeemaker these k cups make a weak cup of coffee more like brown water no taste no nothing i switched to the smallest size cup and it s marginally better but still barely drinkable i wouldn t serve these to guests ever i can t wait to be done with these boxes of junk so i can order something with some taste please don t waste your money
negative,7/9/21,the aroma is pleasant and flavor is nice and smooth but it is very very weak i really wanted to like this one as there are very few available on subscribe and save but i just cannot recommend it even making smaller cups it is very weak i m going to stick to newman s own organics extra bold as my go to k cup for now
negative,25/8/21,i admit i am not terribly fond of flavored coffees but this one is not for us we both love the rodeo drive i have a good freind that loves this coffee i sent her ours
negative,6/9/21,i am definitely not a coffee connoisseur but this stuff is bad it is a disappointment because i expected a wolfgang puck product to have more class this tastes artificial and it can t stand alone without tons of cream and sweetener will not buy again
negative,25/5/21,the coffee tasted bitter and like it was burnt i cleaned the machine and it still tasted bitter and burnt will not order this again
negative,7/9/21,i m amazed that people are happy with this product i m not a drinker of the dark brews french roast or anything but even for a drinker of a milder cup of coffee this is completely tasteless the initial scent is delicious too bad none of it shows up in the actual coffee
negative,13/10/21,to me this coffee was extremely bitter i dumped it out and made a different cup it made me afraid to try other wp coffees but i did like the wp sumatra kopi raya for reference purposes my in store drink is a starbucks americano my favorite k cups are starbucks french roast starbucks caffe verona starbucks pike place roast green mountain xtra bold sumatran reserve green mountain double black diamond green mountain revv green mountain dark magic other k cups i ve tried coffee people jet fuel green mountain dark magic decaf emeril jazzed up decaf starbucks caffe verona coffee people black tiger starbucks house blend starbucks breakfast blend starbucks sumatra wolfgang puck french roast green mountain lake and lodge green mountain french roast caribou mahogony wolfgang puck sumatra kopi raya emeril big easy bold
negative,2/10/21,this wolfgang puck coffee jamaica me crazy is the worst coffee i ve ever had i threw it out right away after one sip it taste like all coconut flavoring hard to believe someone thought this taste good and was marketable they should be fired
negative,23/9/21,ugh no where on the amazon page for this item did it state that it was hazelnut flavored i have been choking this down for a month just trying to get through it thought it was going to be a blue mountain like jamaican coffee
negative,26/6/21,this coffee is only mediocre in quality i do not like a highly acidic coffee nor do i like it when the coffee outdates within weeks of the order date the only reason i am not more dissatified with this lousy coffee is that i paid very little for it by using a credit i had at amazon payments i do not recommend this coffee
negative,25/5/21,if keurig brewers were evaluated by this particular k cup keurig would be out of business wolfgang puck french roast melange francais is inexcusably terrible coffee aroma hints of singed oak leave and the top note is simply bitter mid taste is like the bottom ounces of a days old kwiki mart carafe mouth feel is harsh and leaves an appalling coating the after taste leads one to immediately brush ones teeth i simply couldn t believe my keurig was capable of making such a bad cup of coffee so i tried again a week later with same results i use average to good filtered water and have no problems with other brands like green mountain tulleys nor emeril s everyone i know that has a keurig learned of it via word of mouth or a shared cup usually the results are stunning and the keurig invasion lives on when i share i ll stick with offering the coffee peoples black tiger or jet fuel now i have more wp fr k cups sitting in the bottom draw of my china cabinet to get rid of let me know if you want them as i d be embarrassed to even give them away sorry wolfgang but what the puck your french roast is unpardonably horrible and at k cup prices i ll not be duped again i ll stay away from any of the other wp offerings
negative,7/9/21,this stuff tasted like pipe tobacco smells my son didn t like it either and i ended up throwing it out
negative,15/7/21,no thanks kind of bitter and has slight overtone of cardboard organic bold and donut shop are still our faves
negative,3/6/21,wolfgang puck s breakfast in bed is a much more flavorful and robust medium roast than this one
negative,27/9/21,this is not regular coffee as the description would lead you to believe it s artificially flavored and it appears from the other ratings that you either love the flavor or hate it my household hated it of course that would be my problem if the description was accurate but it s not amazon refunded my money and said someone would check the information on the product page
negative,19/6/21,as coffee these kcups are just ok as flavored coffee these are disappointing i found the vanilla to be barely detectable

negative,7/9/21,product has a shelf life of two years and was labeled as produced in december of product leaked from seal in carton
negative,3/8/21,i am not happy about writing this review i had very high expectations from both the name and the high praise given by the other reviewers i was at once concerned however based on the weak aroma at first opening and these initial concerns were confirmed at first use little flavor here i have found a home recipe based off of the ingredient list with stuff from my spice rack produces a much better result beef rub brown sugar sea salt paprika chille rosemary fresh garlic chipotle powder cumin and mccormick montreal steak seasoning chicken rub brown sugar paprika sea salt chille mccormick montreal chicken seasoning curry garlic cinnamon and chinese five spices

negative,7/9/21,these jelly beans were very unusual when they showed up they came in a package without a jelly belly logo the jelly beans themselves had no jelly belly logo and i don t really know if they were actually jelly bellys i got them as a gift so i didn t try any of them but it was odd giving a gift where it didn t seem like they were anything special like i d bagged up some licorice jelly beans from the grocery store or something big woop so i was disappointed and because they were a gift i had no idea what they tasted like so were they really jelly bellys who knows i felt silly giving them though
negative,11/9/21,i would not buy this particular yogi tea again because i hate the taste of licorice anise the flavor of the licorice and fennel seed is very dominant making it a sort of sickly sweet flavor which wasn t what i was hoping for with my burning throat i think a better blend would be something with more heat like ginger which is why i usually drink yogi s cold season instead for the same purpose with a sore throat its reasonable to suffer through a yucky flavor if it makes a discernible difference but this tea didn t do that
negative,13/7/21,i ordered this for my birthday i got birthday money from family and i ordered a couple of goodies perfume and this cocoa i love hot chocolate and i m always looking for new ones to try based on the first review i decided to go ahead and order i will probably not reorder mixed by itself into hot water it seems to lack thickness it also has too much of an artificial raspberry taste i like hershey s bliss raspberry chocolate much better i ve been adding one spoonful of the cobblestone kitchen to my regular cocoa to give it a raspberry boost but by itself it does not stand up to the test i plan on finishing the three remaining cans over time by using it as a stir in additive to other cocoa
negative,22/7/21,my first time having curry rice but boy i cooked this stuff exactly how you re supposed to taste wasn t bad i guess a little strong though it was thick like ice slush it was over bearing and the spice was pretty intense i don t think i ll get it again i guess it s good stuff seen it in some curry making videos used often but not for me as it it is way to thick i had potatoes onions and pork prepared to perfection mixed with it and i could not taste them at all i could not taste the pork or anything only the sauce
negative,22/6/21,we tried this formula because it is lactose free my baby does not have any other issues just lactose intolerant we found that it smells bad does not mix well into water and my baby would not drink a drop
negative,28/7/21,good idea but the company should use a better soil compound maybe darker it s hard to tell if the soil is wet or dry present compound blows away when i water it finally sprouted and i ll transpant to a regular top soil when it grows more at least with soil you can tell when it s dry right now i will give it small amounts of water weekly until that happens very disappointed with this product
negative,13/10/21,i bought two bags of these thinking it was the same product that i used to buy in different packaging light blue with a see through dog shape against a grass green background unfortunately it was completely not the same thing these treats were actually like jerky tough and brittle i give my dog soft treats because he doesn t chew the damn things and he choked on these horrible things i had to toss them out note that the zuke s jerky naturals with the other packaging http www amazon com zukes jerky naturals beef dp b dfpy have always been moist and soft and i ve never had a problem with those i suspect that this batch was not new packaging as i had thought but very old packaging these may be the same treats i usually feed my dog just having sat on a shelf for years in any case these were completely different treats and not safe to feed my dog
negative,19/2/21,under the product features it says all meats are sourced in the usa i got the lamb and rice jerky today and it says on the package the lamb comes from new zealand that s a huge misrepresentation of this product on the product page very disappointed

negative,14/12/20,i purchased two of these and they arrived with the package split and the items all over the box i contacted amazon and they sent two more out these also arrived with the packages open amazon was very courteous and professional as always i cannot review the item itself because the packaging is so horrible that i have given up on trying again
negative,19/2/21,sorry as i stated on my other reviews my german breed g sheph is very picky and he just did not care for the smell of these beef rolls he did not even care to come close to take nd sniff sorry no star but it triggered me to give it as least star to continue my review

negative,19/2/21,if this was called medium roast i would give it stars it s a good coffee but this is called french vanilla caramel and this review is based on the product s name let me say that vanilla and caramel are perhaps my favorite flavors coffee ice cream candy you name it if it s vanilla or caramel i love it with the exception of this where s the vanilla where s the caramel and don t get me wrong i m not trying to say that the flavors are too mild i m saying that they are non existent and therefore based on the name this coffee gets star

negative,19/2/21,my wife really loves o n e coconut water i thought via auto ship would be a great way not to have to go to the store every other day to get some i ordered cases of ea the first problem occurred when case number one was sent back as undeliverable i guess a san diego address would be undeliverable in kentucky of the remaining cases all of which did arrive but in not great condition all the cases were still sealed but had of the ounce boxes split open and there were other boxes in other cases that were stale really had a rancid smell therefore i cancelled the auto ship and have gone back to picking this up in the local supermarket works out better just more time consuming and heavier it would have been nice knowing that the cases were in fact pretty flimsy my wife still loves the product
negative,14/12/20,first off i didn t purchase this product through amazon but at a local grocery store so my review only reflects the product itself not amazon in any way i bought this last week never having tried coconut water before but i heard good things the taste of it was almost like the smell of lawn clippings that had been damp and out in the sun for a long time tasted off and had a faint mold smell to it i didn t know if it was supposed to taste like that or not as i never tried it before but paying as much as i did i felt obligated to finish it off i ve been ill for about a week after drinking it i don t know if it was just a coincidence or the because of it i did email customer service at o n e the day i drank it asking if it was supposed to taste like that or if i got a bad batch and they still haven t replied to me
negative,1/6/21,people watch out if you are buying this product online i ve ordered bottles of the o n e i was expecting this to be same as what i bought from store but this seller disappointed me the bottles have the seal broken and the taste of the coconut water is not what i expected i m sure that this seller the person who packaged the bottles added water by breaking the seal i ve wasted my money on this product i ll never buy this online for a few bucks cheap rather than go to the nearby store and buy it my rating for this product is in short seal broken diluted and not comparable with the one that i bought from store
negative,1/4/21,hi i am very disappointed with the past shipment i received of the one coconut water of the boxes were leaking and the coconut water was spoiled thanks laks
negative,15/4/21,so you know i am serious i would give it a were it an option i love amazon they have never let me down so i am hoping they come through for me when i file a claim with them the product was rock hard so i followed the enclosed instructions and heated it even less than the recommended time in the microwave it kneaded easily enough and smelled tasted good when it came to rolling i could tell immediately that this was going to be a challenge sure enough it tore all over the place redo i used cornstarch the way i was taught and it still stuck to every surface as if it were too warm or wet yet cracked as if it were too dry nothing made it cooperate so i lowered my standards and draped it anyway durring the two foot trip from the rolling surface to the cake it ripped in several places and the application to the cake ended in absolute disaster no i did not roll it too thin yes i used cornstarch even though the packaging specifically claims it is unnecessary it sucks the end
negative,19/5/21,this product was so easy to work with on i made a little over flowers for wedding cupcakes the following day i did the same using a different color of satin ice the flowers of both fondants were firm i stored them in an air tight container on i opened the container of flower made with the fondarific and they were soft the flowers made from satin ice were perfect i left the container of fondarific flowers open over night to see if they would harden up again they turned out gummy you know like chewed gum which is probably less sticky than this mess i am so dissappointed in this product fortunately i made my flowers early i have time to purchase satin ice and make more flowers i do not recommend this product

negative,14/12/20,i was excited to see that amazon is selling kopi luwak however these beans were a huge disappointment because they had no aroma and flavor at all i m guessing that they sent stale beans because there was no roast date printed on the bag
negative,28/7/21,there was no seal of any kind on jar cap had loosened slightly and some of the paprika had spilled out would not chance using an open jar so in the trash it went

negative,15/10/21,i guess everyone s taste buds are different this product didn t work for me every food item tasted as it should
negative,20/7/21,dissolved an entire tab on my tongue and was disappointed to discover that it had no effect on any of the foods that i tried
negative,12/10/21,i bought my mberry pack from mberry us online hoping to use it to curb my sweet tooth i followed the directions to the letter allowing the tablet to dissolve completely on my tongue i then tried balsalmic vinegar nothing happened to the taste at all except that my tongue burned a little so i tried hot sauce nothing happened again except that my tongue burned a lot then i tried regular vinegar nothing happened again i even tried taking a second tablet but it still did nothing but slightly burn my tongue huge waste of money super disappointing does not work
negative,19/2/21,not much to say other than the product solicitation is all hype i carefully followed the directions on the packaging of the mberry miracle fruit tablets and the results were about as miraculous as one of those potato chips baring the face of mary magdelene sorry believers of miracles this is one that won t make the tonight show
negative,14/12/20,i was excited about these and had organized a whole event for my fiancee s birthday around these tablets placed an order well in advance namely weeks in advance after two weeks of waiting i received a notification that my order was being cancelled for some mysterious as yet to be determined problem the email attempted to spread the blame between amazon its supplier and some mysterious unknown factor ultimately taking no real responsibility for the blunder color me frustrated and confused because while they said they are stopping all orders for the time being their company website still shows the product in stock and ready for orders this to say the least was very disappointing and more so because the company s response was very wishy washy and lame in my experience when a company screws up mind you it wasn t just my order it was a whole slew of orders that got cancelled they should own up and take responsibility thereby showing some integrity rather than mutter some indecipherable mumbo jumbo that does nothing to explain nor solve the customers problem
negative,2/7/21,i m jealous of whoever thought of this but the actual product turns out to be pretty unimpressive it turns out if you eat half a fruit roll up then eat asparagus the aspragus tastes differently than you might expect there that s all you need to know don t buy this product just buy some gushers next time you re at wal mart star review because i like gushers
negative,11/3/21,i dissolved an entire tab in my mouth and then ate bitter greens and it did nothing i added some vinegar to the greens and it did make it a tad sweeter but it did not make them taste good it makes really sour things slightly sweeter but no miracle
negative,10/4/21,maybe the miracle fruit does not work for everyone it had very little effect when i used it i started with a clear pallet let the pill dissolve on my tongue etc then i tried the classic first a lime i noticed barely that it was not quite as pucker inducing as it may have been without the mberry but just slightly and it did not add any sweet it just inhibited a hint of sour other foods like vinegar vinegar chips guinness strawberries cheese etc many recommended fruits and foods have very little impact and after just a few minutes i could notice any change so either some people just don t have the same level of effect or much of the miracle berry effects are group dynamics and heightened suggestibility either way they were a let down
negative,22/7/19,this was the first time i tried purchasing a food product over the internet and as feared i was sent something other than what was pictured this package contains chia seed powder which i assume is ground up seed or the remainder from packaging whole seeds that you have no way of identifying whether or not has additional filler not going to bother returning a product but just disappointed when the page advertises whole seeds
negative,2/2/20,i was surprised by the number of star reviews of this product its a tiny gritty seed that gets stuck in every corner of your mouth and the taste is like nothing kind of like poppy seeds but with out the taste i finally ask myself why am i eating this annoying seed and put it out back in the bird feeder unfortunately they don t seem to like it much either
negative,2/2/20,you think you re doing something good for your kid when you invest a little more to get an organic formula sadly that s not the case here this is a horrifically constipating formula lots of pain and straining guaranteed having to take measures to prevent this offering juices water etc is just not a sensible approach also the manufacturers use sucrose instead of lactose to save money and they use a lot of it with the same sweetness as country time lemonade similac organic s sucrose based formula may also set your child up for future diabetes check the ny times article for more info on this bottom line painful constipation in the near term possible diabetes and certainly a sweet tooth in the future no thanks
negative,31/8/19,out of stars read this article first august by pregbaby florida see all my reviews i thought i was doing the right thing by buying organic and thought similac was a brand i could trust to be good for baby that is until i came across this ny times article about the sugar they use from the article parents may be buying similac organic because they believe that organic is healthier but babies may have a reason of their own for preferring similac organic it is significantly sweeter than other formulas it is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar or sucrose which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas no health problems in babies have been associated with similac organic but to pediatricians there are risks in giving babies cane sugar sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars once babies get used to its sweeter taste they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods and some studies suggest that they might overeat leading to rapid weight gain in the first year which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity
negative,22/7/19,we switched from the advance similac to the organic product thinking it would be better as we prefer organic foods ourselves it was a disaster with our month old baby getting constipated and progressively worsening her intake till she fell drastically below her calorie intake we discontinued the product within five days and switched back to the previous similac and she is fine now her feeding and calorie intake is back to normal
negative,12/1/20,reconsider this formula martek advertises this formula on their website although martek told the board that they would discontinue the use of the controversial neurotoxic solvent n hexane for dha ara processing they did not disclose what other synthetic solvents would be substituted federal organic standards prohibit the use of all synthetic petrochemical solvents martek biosciences was able to dodge the ban on hexane extraction by claiming usda does not consider omega and omega fats to be agricultural ingredients therefore they argue the ban against hexane extraction does not apply the usda helped them out by classifying those oils as necessary vitamins and minerals which are exempt from the hexane ban but hexane extraction is just the tip of the iceberg other questionable manufacturing practices and misleading statements by martek included undisclosed synthetic ingredients prohibited for use in organics including the sugar alcohol mannitol modified starch glucose syrup solids and other undisclosed ingredients microencapsulation of the powder and nanotechnology which are prohibited under organic laws use of volatile synthetic solvents besides hexane such as isopropyl alcohol recombinant dna techniques and other forms of genetic modification of organisms mutagenesis use of gmo corn as a fermentation medium heavily processed ingredients that are far from natural quote from why is this organic food stuffed with toxic solvents by dr mercola google gmos found in martek this is the latest i have found on dha in organic and non organic baby food formula at least read this one google false claims that dha in organic and non organic infant formula is safe and organicconsumersdotorg martek s patents for life sdha states includes mutant organisms and recombinant organisms a k a gmos the patents explain that the oil is extracted readily with an effective amount of solvent a preferred solvent is hexane the patent for life sara states genetically engineering microorganisms to produce increased amounts of arachidonic acid and extraction with solvents such as hexane martek has many other patents for dha and ara all of them include gmos gmos and volatile synthetic solvents like hexane aren t allowed in usda organic products and ingredients tragically martek s life sdha is already in hundreds of products many of them certified usda organic please demand that the national organic standards board reject martek s petition and that the usda national organic program inform the company that the illegal approval is rescinded and that their gmo hexane extracted life sdha and life sara are no longer allowed in organic products but i went to the lifesdha website and they do not disclose how they make their lifesdha i have contacted the company to see what they say also these are the corporate practices of martek which are damaging to the environment as well written just last dec at naturalnewsdotcom the best bet is to just avoid the lifedha at this time in my opinion b c corporate america cares more about the almighty than your health
negative,19/2/20,i ordered this on and it didn t ship out until three and a half weeks later it s and i still haven t received it yet next time i plan to order from a merchant who can fulfill it in a reasonable timeframe as far as the product is concerned i do like that the similac liquid formula in the oz size doesn t contain bpa i was really upset when i researched and discovered that the single use ready made liquid containers and large powdered containers both contain bpa i would expect more diligence from similac to be bpa free in all of their packaging
negative,27/11/19,my child was exclusively breastfed for months and i gradually introduced similac organic formula to supplement my breastmilk started to dry up she found this was so much easier to eat she gave up on me by months by the time i completely stopped nursing she was so constipated from the formula that i switched she winced and cried and worked so long to just produced a hard ball the size of ping pong ball it was horrible i realized i was the one helping her poo with nursing and then she lost all ability when she went full formula i say switch
negative,12/12/19,we breastfeed our month old boy but since his bilirubin level was still high doctors recommended to switch to formula for hours we started with similac advance shield plus which we still had from hospital first hours were wonderful in terms of pooping then we decided to switch to similac organic for known reasons but during the first ounce bottle i began to notice that his stool was getting harder and eventually he stopped pooing actually he produced two stone ball like poops and had a hard time for another hours breast milk and similac advance tested similarly sweet but similac organic was much much less sweet i made a research on the internet and i found the following that may help you to understand the because of constipation http www drhull com encymaster c constipation infant html constipation means infrequent hard stools it does not mean grunting or straining although your baby may certainly exhibit these behaviors when having a bowel movement so the first question to ask is is my child really constipated next consider why true constipation excessively hard dry stools arises the normal function of the colon is to remove water from the stool otherwise we would rapidly dehydrate and die that is why severe diarrhea is dangerous the stool is moving through the colon and being expelled from the body so fast there is no time to properly reabsorb the stool water back into the bloodstream conversely if the fecal material remains in the colon too long the water removal process may extract too much of the fecal water and leave the stool mass excessively dry and hard it is just that simple so constipation arises when feces remain in the colon too long because the colon is naturally sluggish has decreased motility we say a low residue diet produces insufficient stimulation to the colon to trigger its normal propulsive activity and clear out the feces a combination of the above two factors there is obstruction of the lower gi tract o functional neurologic the lower rectum and anus cannot properly relax to allow evacuation hirschprung disease o functional anatomic anal rectal positioning doesn t allow easy evacuation o mechanical a tumor physically blocks stool passage breast fed babies are essentially never truly constipated this is because breast milk is such a low residue diet almost all of the milk is absorbed by the baby and used the stools consist of a small amount of unabsorbed protein curds and a large amount of bowel secretions chiefly mucus and of course a lot of noisy gas but these infrequent stools do not indicate constipation just infrequent stools later when breast feeding infants start solids they technically can become constipated but it is unusual in my experience it is not until the child is pretty much on solids and especially when weaned to whole cow milk that constipation is much of an issue by then we are really discussing toddlers breast fed infants do tend to save up after the first few months and poop less often this worries some parents despite reassurances to the contrary some folks just have to see a poop every day from their little darling to be happy and fulfilled go figure they forget that stool can stay in the colon for a very very long time and it will not hurt anything when the stool hoarding breast feeder does finally get ready to go another problem comes to the fore grunting and straining when the baby s rectum forms in utero it is in a state of permanent contraction for nigh onto nine months the baby does not pass the meconium fetal stool in utero until perhaps right at the end of gestation right before during or after delivery until the baby is several months old and has passed and been stretched by quite a few bowel movements the rectum and particularly the anus may be quite tight and resist easy dilation to allow the stool to pass because the baby has weak flabby abdominal musculature that is why his little tummy is so poochy he must push against this tight anal spincter with his diaphragm just as mom pushed during delivery and with seemingly equal discomfort hence the grunting and red faced straining the other major problem of both breast or bottle fed newborns which creates this sort of straining is dyschezia or uncoordinated stooling the cure for the problem of a tight anus is pretty simple a gentle rectal exam with a well lubricated pinky finger by the doctor which should be done on all babies with stooling troubles anyway to rule out a physical obstruction will be both diagnostic and curative if one such gentle dilation doesn t do the trick i have mom bring the baby back in a week and repeat the procedure the anal spincter is stretched and pretty soon no more terrible straining top bottle fed infants are a whole nother story infant formulas are not nearly as well digested as breast milk and leave quite a bit more residue in the colon the exception to this rule in my mind is the new similac that really does seem to leave the stools about the same consistency as breast milk so true constipation in bottle fed infants is much more common my feeling is that soy formulas are even worse than cow milk based formulas in this regard the young infant s colon is simply not designed for all the residue and stool bulk the residue builds up is dried too much and becomes hard pebbly stool it is naturally difficult and uncomfortable for the baby to pass the addition of cereal to the diet only compounds whatever problems already exist cereal milk concrete cereal in the formula bottle seems to be especially bad probably because parents don t realise just how much cereal the baby is getting top treatment of constipation mainly involves common sense diet modifications and sometimes medication again as with breast fed babies a search for the because of the constipation and gentle rectal exam can work wonders i use a lot of karo corn syrup for bottle feeders with constipation it is my first choice recomendation it almost always works if used properly unfortunately many doctors and nurses don t use it properly get poor results and don t recommend it as often as they should i start with two measuring teaspoons in every formula bottle regardless of size and adjust the dose up or down depending on how things are going usually the baby can be weaned off the karo pretty soon but may need to stay on it periodically for the first few months of life it is very important to put the corn syrup in the formula and not give it in between in water the excess corn syrup does not get digested very well the baby is already digesting all the sugar he can from the formula the excess sugar passes down to the colon and produces a sugar diarrhea similar to sorbitol as below prunes apple juice before scolding me about the risk of botulism from corn syrup please see clinical pediatric emergency medicine volume number september pediatric neurologic potpourri cases to remember in the past c botulinum was also found in corn syrup but this is no longer a risk factor for infant botulism because of a recent change in the processing formula for the complete source of statement see olsen sj swerdlow dl risk of infant botulism from corn syrup in reply pediatr infect dis j certain fruits and juices for example prunes apple juice apricots are rich in sorbitol a nondigestible sugar that passes through the body to the colon and causes water to be retained or drawn into the stool mass they can be increased in the diet to loosen the stool and relieve or prevent constipation lactulose is a non absorbable sugar product that is processed by colon bacteria to produce an inflow of water into the stool mass we use it a lot it seems to be a favorite of our local pediatric gastroenterologists the dose is adjusted up or down according to respose side effects are usually not serious but can include cramping or diarrhea obviously stop the medicine and call your doctor if these occur glycerine suppositories are helpful to relieve your child if there is some hard stool that just won t come out easily the suppository melts in the heat of the rectum and lubricates the stool glycerine also has a mild effect of attracting water into the stool which softens it the act of insertion also serves to stimulate the rectum and anus to initiate the defecation reflex glycerine is completely safe it is a food found in candy not a drug fiber containing foods are helpful for older children and adults but are not really of much use in the treatment of young infant constipation for dietary reasons babies just don t eat a lot of fiber i believe isoyalac which was a high fiber soy formula has been discontinued it was never very available any place i practiced anyway top myths and misconceptions concerning infant constipation iron in the formula causes constipation no way i can understand lay people thinking this to be the case because when adults take iron preparations in large doses they may become constipated but the tiny amount present in infant formula is not nearly enough to because any problems the irritating thing to me is to hear doctors and nurses who should know better repeating this nonsense and switching the infants to the less healthy low or no iron formulas increasing water in the diet is commonly recommended it makes very little sense and demonstrates a failure to reflect on the basic physiologic because of the overdry stool the problem is too little water retention in the stool not too little water in the body unless there is increased fiber or some chemical substance such as a sugar karo lactulose to retain the water in the stool excess water will simply wind up in the diaper as urine top
negative,26/9/20,do not buy this product you will not be doing your infant any favors if at all possible you should be breastfeeding i know it s not always easy or convenient if you can t then in my opinion the best formula is earth s best and even that is disappointing basically they dry cow s milk and remove all the natural nutrients then fortify with synthetic vitamins minerals pathetic just buy whole organic milk raw if possible there are recipes online to make it closer to human breast milk sorry to be so matter of fact i m losing patience for all these evil corporations capitalizing on the green movement oh and by the way the second ingredient in this garbage is sugar good way to start the diabetes obesity while they re young

negative,30/1/21,i was very disappointed with the quality of the coffee i have purchased blue mountain coffee before from other places and it was always great but this was totally unsatisfactory it had a mildewed flavor to it like it had been stored for a long time in a warehouse that was damp or moldy for the money i paid for it i was quite displeased and will never buy from them again
negative,2/11/20,my son had this jablum roasted and ground coffee brought back from jamaica and paid a lot for it i have drunk blue mountain for years when i can but this was shocking it tasted stale when you opened the bag and even worse when you drank it it was definitely off he bought bags and every one we tried was the same i would never buy another we had bought another brand in a tin from jamaica which was fine i think this is a con you get all the rubbish about it being tested in jamaica well i do not know who tests it but definitely not someone who likes good coffee i just do not understand how people say its any good maybe having paid so much for it its like the emperor s new clothes
negative,17/10/20,while in jamaica my wife and i drank blue mountain coffer every day and loved it we even went on a bike tour of the blue mountains and purchased some coffee it came in a plain clear plastic bag and we could see the darkness of the roast we enjoyed that coffee in ocho rios we bought some bags of jablum you can t see the darkness of the roast and all you can smell is the burlap bag when we opened it up it was a very light roast not much fragrance and once brewed the coffee tasted a lot like dirt we were very disappointed
negative,22/7/19,i recently ordered the oz pack when my fedex order arrived on december there were only two oz bags contained in my order i would like my missing oz bag to be sent to me or at least be refunded of my charged price
negative,2/2/20,i don t get all the hype over this coffee not much of a head on it doesn t taste that great what s the big whoop
negative,4/10/20,not what i expected at all there is no punch to these chips like i thought there would be not spicy or hot but rather just disgusting the flavor is off and the after taste is god awful i ate one corn chip and decided i did not care for them so i ate something else to get the flavor of poop out of my mouth because that is what these chips taste like and i can still taste these poo chips i will not be buying these chips again at all there blue corn chips are really great but the so called red powder they put on these is just so off
negative,1/4/20,i am giving these two stars because they did taste sorta good at first but like the other reviewer said they do smell funny and they left a bad taste in my mouth and they are very salty i only cooked them for seconds the bag was still expanding when i stopped it but they smelled burnt when they were done they said to cook until it stopped expanding but thank goodness i didn t do that nice idea but i don t think i will buy these again
negative,8/5/20,i was so excited to receive the product i immediately cooked a bag what a disappointment the taste of the pork skins was there but it was buried by some spice that i didn t enjoy i couldn t finish the bag my dog wouldn t eat them either ans she eats everything including brusell sprouts i have had microwave pork skins that were good but i don t remember the brand so i ll just have to do without
negative,18/6/20,a terrible product we follow the intructions and did not get the the pork rinds we only got pieces of pork skin
negative,20/8/20,too salty but that was not even the worst of the problems it has a weird texture i cooked it perfectly and tastes horrible if you haven t eaten pork rinds before please stay away even the worst popcorn tastes better
negative,1/6/21,was really dissappointed in product too salty and poor flavor convenience is what makes product worth purchasing if you like pork rinds
negative,4/7/21,lowrey s has changed it s microwave pork rinds i used to love them the last order i received was put up in a generic paper container with really flimsy cellophane wrapping there is no writing on the paper sack whatsoever the taste is sub par as is the amount of rinds as i said i used to love the product i will buy no more lowrey s microwave pork rinds
negative,5/2/20,giving the other bags of these to the local food shelf just seems too cruel better to throw them away i don t know what good the popping does except make them sort of hot they re too salty have a hideous flavor taste nothing like pork rinds they don t even taste as good as bad pork rinds they re also loaded with chemicals i want to avoid probably part of the source of the hideous flavor
negative,22/7/19,i don t know if i got a bad batch or something but i could nt get these to cook right i followed the instructions and after about two minutes the bag stoped expanding i opened it and found everything badly burnt the next bag i waited about one and a half minutes i opened it and found half the chips uncooked i never could find a time that either left some uncooked or some burnt i shook the bags and scattered the chips inside them well before microwaving each time
negative,2/2/20,i have fond memories as a kid of going to the swap meet with my parents getting the biggest bag of pork rinds they had and pouring as much hot sauce on them as you could handle now that pork rinds can be considered a health snack i bought this box thinking i could have a decent snack every day well they pop up great in a large enough microwave the issue is the seasoning there is way way way too much salt in the seasoning and adding additional hot sauce makes the experience that much more unenjoyable i now have these when i am pretty hungry and want to bring compact snack to a place where i know there will be a microwave but i will not be ordering these again once the box is finished oh and they aren t hot nor spicy just salty
negative,22/11/20,they re ok i guess but each bag has about a pound of salt in it you ll find yourself brushing away salt from each piece just for it to taste somewhat decent also no matter what you set the timer on the microwave you will have little burn hardened pieces so you re not even getting a whole lot out of one bag
negative,1/3/20,i received my shipment today and tried to microwave four bags using different time settings only one or two out of each bag microwave correctly i even put the unpopped on a plate as someone suggested and nothing i carefully followed directions for each bag if i could rate this a zero i would
negative,23/11/20,i tried these and wanted to like them but just couldn t they did not seem to pop very well a lot of wasted product in the bag and they didn t taste very good i will not be buying these again
negative,5/4/21,i ve bought this product many times and this time they are old or defective the bags don t puff up and rinds are flat stale burn when cooked i ve tried different time settings and in different microwaves i m very dissapointed as this is a product i ve been ordering for years guess i ll have to call them and complain
negative,27/4/20,yuck these do not taste good and they are quite tough better off buying the bags of rinds already prepaired
negative,8/3/21,too much message gives it a nasty salty after taste i basically gave them away
negative,30/1/20,ok but too salty they should make a low sodium version the spicy is better
negative,22/7/19,could not get the bags to pop any edible pork rinds i tried several bags with no results i finally had to throw them out i was very dissapointed with this product
negative,2/2/20,i hated the flavor of this product i ended up just giving it away at work who ended up giving it away to there friends
negative,2/9/20,lowrey s bacon curls pork rinds ounce microwave bags are loaded with milligrams of salt that is all i tasted a pinch of salt would have been better
negative,26/1/21,the bags catch fire in my microwave and that leaves most un popped and extremely over salted this product is inferior to other brands i have tried
negative,9/1/21,not one member of my family including me like these extremely salty much too strong a bq taste to order more i purchased them on a recuring basis and i wish to cancel now i have received only one shipment cancel further shipments not to our taste at all these are lowery pork rinds
negative,30/7/21,the taste was a little off to me and like with microwave popcorn not all of the bacon skins developed some were still very hard on the ends and others not developed at all i bought a box of these so i tried to perfect the technique several times with not much better outcomes all in all i will stick with the ready to go variety offered by frito lay and mission
negative,30/10/20,the lowrey s microwave pork rinds that i received was unacceptable i ordered bags and the bags only popped of the bag all rinds popped but for the amount of the money that i paid for them i could have gone to the store and bought a bag already popped and gotten a full bag i feel that it should have popped at least half of the bag i understand that everyone is counting their pennies but i also think that the consumer should get something for their money i really enjoy this product but i probably will not order any more for this reason
negative,3/8/20,a warning should be placed on the item description because this product contains monosodium glutamate message a dangerous excitotoxin which is problematic for many people there is no indication in the item description that this is the case i fully agree with another reviewer that this item also is so extremely salty that it cannot be consumed the message also heightens the very salty taste this item did puff up very nicely in the microwave but it was inedible because of the saltiness and all packages had to be thrown out for that reason i am surprised at the many excellent reviews of this product amazon com gets an a for their wonderful handling of this problem
negative,29/1/21,horrible hemical taste extremely salty this was a complete waste of money after the first bag i will have to throw the whole box away
negative,24/10/21,i tried to cook different bags of these only a fraction of product popped up the ones that managed to pop tasted overly salty and had an unusual flavor unfortunately they were not returnable so the rest will be going to the trash waste of
negative,24/10/21,this is my first time and i can t eat them they are all small hard peaces with only a frw puffie ones is there something wrong with my batch i can t eat them or they would break my teeth am i doing something wrong i only cook them min
negative,16/10/21,i was so excited when i heard about this product i love pork rinds but these have a nasty chemical smell and they really don t taste good at all don t waste your money i actually threw the remaining packages away they really suck
negative,24/10/21,this is a great idea but just like baking a cake you can t do it in a midrowave
negative,25/9/21,i heated these up in the microwave and they do not microwave evenly some will be burnt and hard as a rock when others will be just right since you do not get very many in one bag and since about do not cook right you barely get any pork rinds and throw the rest away maybe i am not cooking them right but i followed the directions
negative,19/10/21,i love chuckles so the temptation to buy some in bulk overtook my better judgement recently i don t know why but i was surprised to discover that each huge movie size box was mostly air and contained a small clear plastic wrapping with pieces of candy in it i am old enough to have fallen for this i ate them all quickly to quell my feelings of having been made an idiot out of yet again by air filled boxed nothingness chuckles is a great and classic candy but this packaging is quite deliberately deceptive and insulting i would shop for other packages at other sites should the chuckles urge overtake me yet again
negative,20/10/21,love this cereal but i buy a oz box at costco for and sometimes am offered it with a box coupon its too high here
negative,19/10/21,i bought this product to get rid of black ants in my house it did not help at all i even tried mixing it with sugar and placing it where the ants used to go well they just don t go anywhere close to it it really looks like it repels the ants instead of attracting them i have not found yet a product that work for my ants except the spray that kills them instantly but i cannot spray it in the kitchen and i have ants all around the counter top even if it is cleaned to perfection
negative,15/6/21,this tin must have been sitting on the shelf for a decade it was totally dried out when i opened it when treacle sponge pudding dries it smells nasty and can t be reconstituted even with water and some heat total waste of money
negative,4/8/21,for the price you pay and size of each cup you can really only make the smallest size you are getting taken with this purchase buy the traditional mix from any other company you will get a better value better taste and a richer texture this snot a horrible mix it tastes ok but it is nothing more than a decent cup of chocolate flavored water it has no thickness to it swiss miss or any other grocery store hot chocolate beats it hands down all you are getting with this is convenience of using k cups which is not much of one to begin with avoid it
negative,4/8/21,it is so watery and weak i had to brew the smallest cup and then put in another pod to get a full cup of hot chocolate this makes the pods very expensive and not figure friendly each pod is calories so a full cup would be will not purchase anymore
negative,18/7/21,the hot chocolate has a weird flavor to it i will not be buying this product again and will probably not consider any more green mountain products
negative,18/10/21,i used the minimum cup size to try and maximize the chocolate taste this did not help but if you like a weak chocolate taste then you will like it
negative,15/6/21,i don t like this product at all much tastier and cheaper to just use hot water and a packet of hot chocolate mix from nestle or swiss miss
negative,4/8/21,this product would be better made with milk which of course then would not be for the keurig machine there are other brands i prefer
negative,8/6/21,this hot chocolate is pretty blah not very chocolatey and certainly not very strong it s not the fault of the keurig the cafe escapes dark chocolate is way better
negative,15/6/21,of course the keurig green mtn hot cocoa is the ultimate in convenience but frankly the flavor is not so hot best description is slightly chocolate flavored cardboard everything else about it is fine consistency ease of use but g m should ramp up the flavor with way more chocolate
negative,4/8/21,i recommend this instead for the same price swiss miss hot cocoa mix milk chocolate count envelopes pack of this thing falls short i found myself adding some milk or my non dairy creamers to my cup of this to make it taste somewhat creamy it more or less tastes horrible otherwise after i hated it i decided to make it with a cup of hot milk i just decided to pour it into a hot cup of milk and it tastes so much better in my opinion they need to up the powdered milk in them or the non dairy creamer in them it would improve this product so greatly they are thieves nonetheless you usually get envelopes of hot cocoa that tastes better than this in the supermarket for less than five bucks buy two for less than ten and still be spending less than what i spent with these i really thought i was buying quality this is definitely not unless i use milk which is like cheating myself and spending extra money i ve drank common hot cocoa from supermarket straight with water that tasted way better than this avoid
negative,25/9/21,the hot chocolate is fine but the price here is crazy you can get the same thing on the keurig site for under
negative,19/10/21,i had high hopes for the convenience of this product my daughter loves hot chocolate this really was a total disappointment i threw these kcups out if you use the smallest setting on your keurig you get oz of watery hot chocolate larger settings are not drinkable save your money and get cocoa packets or a good tin of hot cocoa and take advantage of the instant hot water the keurig provides
negative,4/9/21,i was expecting a bit better after reading other reviews this is about the same as any other hot chocolate made with water i prefer making it with milk as the flavor and texture is much better adding milk didn t help much i guess mom spoiled me good
negative,31/8/21,this is some of the worst stuff i ve ever tried to drink it s even worse than that awful stuff that comes out of those machines where the cup drops down and fills it i tried it on the various cup size settings with my keurig machine and it just goes from bad to horrible when going from the larger size to the smallest it s a complete waste of money i just tried another brand that s similar and it s no good either if you like chocolate water buy these if you have it in mind that you are buying hot chocolate with a milky or creamy flavor that s not what this stuff is yuck
negative,9/10/21,this time forget ordering through amazon you can get the same product k cups for at big cat or for at keurig these prices are a rip off
negative,15/6/21,i used the small cup setting and even opened up the cap and scraped the excess mix out of the cup and it is still very weak tasting
negative,4/8/21,i love green mountain coffee i use it all the time for my k cups i got a sample of the green mountain hot cocoa and thought it would be the best i actually threw it out i tried several times to drink it it tasted bitter and like chemicals i have tried samples of the other brands of hot cocoa and this by far was the worst i was so surprised because i adore their coffee i personally would not recommend this maybe it is the soy i don t know it just tasted very very odd i still would recommend their coffees though just to be fair i did add chocolate redi whip but i add that to all of my hot cocoa and it always tastes good
negative,15/6/21,we fed this to our bulldog when she was a puppy and at first she did wonderful then the corn and preservatives took their toll she was itching and had a chronic ear infection and her face had a terrible yeasty smell all the time she licked her paws constantly and scratched her face raw on any surface she could find then she started vomiting we had to change her food now she eats a fully carnivorous raw diet and is thriving no more itching no more ear infections no more yeast no more paw licking
negative,4/8/21,i wanted to give this product a try as the liquid honey crystallized in a few weeks during the winter months this small oz packet does clump together a lot more than other sweeteners so there is less of an advantage over using honey in a jar and spooning out the crystallized honey for the price i consider it a poor value taste is ok but nothing to rave about and not as good as with regular unprocessed honey
negative,15/6/21,this is basically candy masquerading as a healthy snack they taste good because they have three different kinds of sugar in them blue diamond wants you to think that eating sugar is a healthy snack c mon i purchased these thinking they were sweetened with stevia yeah there s a miniscule amount of stevia very last ingredient but sugars are the nd rd and th ingredient listed these have corn maltodextrin the worst thing there is on the glycemic index can you say fat formation now i m stuck with containers of this sugar snack
negative,4/8/21,i purchased other types of blue diamond almonds on the same day and they were both around for a pack of t his one was only one oz container and i assumed it was at least containers since the cost was over
negative,1/10/21,the delivery was extremely quick the packaging was fine and if you suck off all the honey the almonds even taste pretty good but i for one do not like this flavor mind you i could eat honey roasted peanuts
negative,1/7/18,i would not recommend this oil it does not have a pleasant smell and does not purify the skin it s just like other oils i have bought from drug stores which were cheaper
negative,10/8/18,i guess i m in the minority but i really didn t like these much i was so excited for a cheesecake flavor when i saw it but these were disappointing the bars are super sickly sweet with a weird chemically fake vanilla ish undertaste absolutely no cheesecake or cream cheese type flavor and even the graham layer is just sweet without any real graham cracker taste the overall texture is slightly gritty and gummy not at all creamy sizewise they are smallish but pretty standard for any of the many calorie ish snack pack foods similar in price as most granola and snack bars none of which are ever much of a good value overall while they aren t inedible or anything i would not buy these again and i don t even think i ll bother with the rest of the box
negative,1/7/18,ingredients on deep river snacks s website are potatoes sunflower oil and or corn oil whey sea salt onion powder sugar garlic powder torula yeast dried parsley maltodextrix canola oil soybean oil rosemary extract and natural flavors false adversing much
negative,10/8/18,these chips are very spicy to say the least my tongue burned too much to finish the small individual serving bag they have an overpowering amount of some asian spice perhaps ginger but it is way too strong and you are left with a very unpleasant taste i bought of the small size bags but could not bring myself to like the flavor it all ended up in the trash this is definitely a chip that will appeal to only certain palates i do like the sweet onion flavor of this brand but this asian flavor was too much of a good thing
negative,13/9/18,the sweet maui onion tastes like sour cream and onion i was hoping to get the delicious chips that i enjoyed in maui don t wast your time
negative,17/7/18,i love salt vinegar kettle chips so i decided to try these after reading good reviews when i received them i noticed from the very first bag that over half of the chips were inedible due to rotten potatoes i know how kettle chips should look and i know what normal marks look like on chips these were rotten after waiting over a month for a response from the company i finally found a phone number and called them only to be told there was nothing they could do the sad thing is the chips that were edible were actually flavorful and tasty obviously they just don t care about consistent quality so stay away from these chips
negative,16/1/19,the kettle chip itself is crisp crunchy and good although somewhat greasy over coated with the flavoring causing mouth burn when it was not expected in a chip with rosemary flavoring leaves greasy gritty residue on fingers after two or three chips
negative,16/1/18,i ve got to believe these other reviewers haven t actually looked at the list of ingredients that make up these chips here they are ingredients sugar partially hydrogenated palm kernel oil coconut oil lactose whey natural and artificial flavors including barley protein non fat milk buttermilk solids sodium caseinate soy lecithin an emulsifier salt artificial colors yellow lake yellow lake blue lake now i must admit that i didn t look at the label either i ve been using nestle s chocolate chips for years and i thought it was a name i could trust apparently not so let me tell you how i discovered what the ingredients were i was making brownies for the kids for a semi special occasion so i bought the premium white morsels thinking they were white chocolate and these butterscotch ones i dumped them in my batter and noticed when i took the brownies out that the chips didn t seem to have melted i didn t think anything of it until i sampled some of the white morsels for a snack very waxy on the tongue not nice like good chocolate would be so i tried the butterscotch ones where the heck was the flavor well i was shocked when i read the label i had no idea that the white chocolate had been reformulated to be chocolate free and i assume that in the past these chips actually had some sort of natural butterscotch element to them instead of being made of barley protein and artificial flavorings i mean look at the ingredients there s more artificial flavors by volume than butter and milk and there s a whopping grams of sugar in teaspoon of these things which would be acceptable for cooking sweets if it wasn t for the grams of trans fats laden goo that was also in them in any case i ve thrown out the rest of these two bags if the health concerns weren t bad enough they don t taste good really sweet more than flavorful and waxy on the tongue when you eat them au naturel pam t mom blogger brownie baker
negative,16/1/19,i was wondering how my cookies which were a spin on the america s test kitchen perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe could have come out tasting like crud well it was the butterscotch chips i basically took atk s recipe and adjusted it for oatmeal insead of the chocolate chip by using their base and adding oats raisins chopped mac nuts cinnamon and these chips it would have been just as amazing as the chocolate chip cookie recipe if i would have ommitted these chips now as another reviewer said the cookies with the chips in it are destined for the trash
negative,1/8/20,this lemon salt is ok but the salt is not infused with the lemon the lemon is mixed with salt granuals so might as well use lemon
negative,1/7/18,i bought these cookies after reading all the rave reviews but they were very dry didn t have much chocolate and left an unpleasant aftertaste i don t understand what all the fuss is about if these were the only gf cookies available i still wouldn t buy them again
negative,10/8/18,these cookies are small grainy and very crunchy with an awful aftertaste and very expensive for such a small package of cookies might be great for multiple allergies but i was very disappointed
negative,15/2/20,as a mom with celiac disease with one son that has a tree nut allergy and another that has a soy allergy i really wanted to like these cookies we are used to cooking everything from scratch to ensure the safety of our food wouldn t it be great to have a cookie that my tree nut allergic son and i could grab on the go i paid a visit to my local starbucks to pick up a oz pack of the sugar cookies and excitedly opened the package the smell alone was enough to immediately turn me off the bag had a synthetic odd smell inside i took a bite of the cookie and noted its crunchiness a good thing about the cookie but then was overwhelmed by an extremely unpleasant aftertaste it almost tasted like burnt popcorn with an artifical butter flavor a very odd and unpalatable taste indeed i was so disappointed i really liked the story of dr lucy and the idea of the cookie but most definitely did not like the cookie although i would classify myself as a bit of a food snob with high standards i put that aside when reviewing this cookie i do not think even the less discerning customer would enjoy this cookie
negative,22/4/21,i bought a package of these at starbucks and thought good crispy hmmmm so i bought a case of a mix cinnamon sugar chocolate chip and oatmeal first they all tasted the same they are probably suppose to be crispy but they taste stale and then they leave an awful aftertaste they also taste way to buttery and a portion side is two cookies and the rest are all cracked in the package there is nothing special about these and are not worth the price although i love the packaging sorry lucy i ve tasted way better gf cookies
negative,25/9/20,these are the worst gluten free cookies i have ever tasted they were hard dry and tasted like tapioca flour avoid these at all cost
negative,16/11/19,i don t have any dietary restrictions i bought these because of an price reduction i wouldn t purchase them again they have very few chocolate chips like you have to hunt for them in the cookie that isn t what chocolate chip cookies should be about the oatmeal version of these cookies is much better
negative,9/9/20,these almonds had an unbelievable amount of salt on them i love salt but this was over the top i ve bought this brand from other stores and they have never been this salty maybe the machine went wacko when processing these i can t eat these unless i take the time to try and wipe off the salt which talks forever
negative,1/7/18,i bought blue diamond natural chocolate almonds before natural almonds it was good but this one made me feel sick i only eat for the day i do not know if it s the salt or something else with this but i have to throw this away i cannot even move to workout i am hoping i can sleep this off but i guess i am the in million that this happens to
negative,10/8/18,when in jamaica i drink jbm coffee and have come to develope a fine appreciation for the bean what i opened this morning was not what i had expected to be clear i was greatly dissapointed i found bits of husk from the bean which doesn t make coffee and is considered filler the flavor left something to be desired as well it tasted like folgers coffee without all the acid i was hoping to leave a great review of this product but honesty forbids it
negative,15/1/20,a co worker of mine went to jamaica for vacation in feb and bought me a lb bag of the ground it s expiration date was march i brewed it as soon as i got home to me it tasted like cheap coffee that had been left out in the open air for a week i wonder if it was due to the expiration date or does this coffee really taste like this if so i will never buy again from all the hype i was expecting much more
negative,1/9/20,i bought the top sirloin hoping to finally get a good steak at home the first ones we cooked could hardly cut with a steak knife the second time we tried them i tenderized for quite some time they were more edible that way but still nothing better than i could have bought at the local grocery store except for the packaging there is nothing good i can say about these steaks if you figure the price per pound these steaks should cut with a butter knife will never buy again
negative,22/7/21,you get bags for in each bag is about a handleful of pretzels the taste is ok but not worth a dollar a bag
negative,1/7/18,these pretzels have a nice crunch and a lot of nutritional value but their flavor is very bland bland with a hint of cinnamon i wish i d tried a single bag before buying an entire bag box but they re not available in stores at least where i live and the reviews seemed fairly positive on the bright side they do leave you feeling comfortably full for minimal calories a recommended diet food for those who have the fortitude to place higher priority on protein dense snacking rather than flavor
negative,10/8/18,the label on the little bag says serving is calories but one serving is ounce the little single serving sized bag is ounces so there are calories in the bag this is sneaky no one is going to open their bag and measure out one ounce then save the other half ounce edited to add i ordered these again because the price went down momentarily is now back up and the product is now changed although amazon still had it listed at ounce bags what i got is oz bags so now yes one bag is a serving but the nutrition facts do not add up to what was listed before now a bag has calories and g carbs another sneaky move you get less for the same price
negative,14/5/21,i ve heard people describe horrible food as tasting like cardboard before i never quite knew what they meant until now this really does taste like cardboard i don t think i could give these a way they are trash don t waste your money here is a better low carb sweet snack blue diamond almonds cinnamon brown sugar ounce jars pack of
negative,17/10/19,its not that this coffee sucks its that it doesn t begin to measure up to all the hoopla its well balanced but that is about it even a little old tasting nothing special in the least what sweet caramel finish can t believe this is the same coffee the star reviews are about
negative,3/10/21,this tea is an excellent herbal tea love the taste and it s not as weak as most herbal tea is i used to get it from the commissary on base but they stopped stocking it so i checked on amazon most wanted to sell by the case but anneeavon sold them in single packages and i swear it said and free shipping when ordered from this seller above the add to cart button i ordered last night and opened my e mail this afternoon to find they charged me shipping for each of the boxes i ordered and the estimated arrival time is a week away for that kind of money i d expect overnight for that kind of money i could have gotten a couple cases and had change it s probably my fault for miss reading something but just be aware of the shipping charges on anneeavon products
negative,15/9/20,it s not an amazing tea it s an okay tea i buy regular green tea at asia market for way cheaper price and i get same result i look for saving money will not repurchase
negative,30/8/20,my dogs have been enjoying these treats for years and we ve ordered this many times from amazon in the past however our last order was a big disappointment the description of exactly how much of this product you will receive is very unclear so when i saw that the product weight is lbs and the shipping weight is lbs naturally i expected to receive a minimum of three one pound bags as we have in the past not so amazon outrageously charged us for a single one pound bag of dried lamb lungs you d think i was buying caviar the treats were promptly packed back up and returned tsk tsk tsk amazon so stars for the product itself stars for amazon this time
negative,1/7/18,this was gross it lamb lund smelled bad there hard chips my dogs favorite is the texas taffy that is a winner i cut it into peices she loves them
negative,10/8/18,i love this sugar i ve been using it packaged in envelopes for a year or two for everything gives a great homemade taste to cookies and packaged in envelopes see sugar in the raw raw sugar ounce bags pack of it s wonderful stuff but not in this packaging if you don t use the whole pounds right away the boxes of sugar turn hard as a rock have to microwave them pound them with a hammer and then pour the sugar into a plastic envelope with a sugar bear e g jbk bear terra cotta brown sugar saver to make it possible to use it definitely not worth it buy it packaged in bags or not at all
negative,5/12/19,these are tasty enough for an emergency snack lunch i keep a few in my file cabinet but our local meijer s sells them for apiece even the discount price here is twice that
negative,21/10/19,i went for these when i got a free bucks to spend with a new amazon credit card and i am glad i didn t pay full price i was in the process of creating an authentic bolognese meat sauce and i wanted some very hearty mushrooms to add a bit of oomph to the sauce which is meat and onion heavy and i figured from the reviews that these are a meaty tasting mushroom i also see the price asked for these at our local giant eagle grocery stores so yeah i did get a bargain from their rip off pricing but these are basically taking up freezer space i ordered two grades a higher grade with bigger shroom pieces less stems etc and in retrospect should have just ordered the scraps or even the dust as i found the big pieces stayed a nasty tough chewy texture even after hours of cooking i also extracted just juice from the mushrooms but the broth wasn t strong enough to bother i basically just chop these in the food processor and add a lot of them to get a change in flavor in recipes the one ounce bags don t even bother with because it takes a lot to get some flavor from them in all honesty i have not used another poricini product so i can t compare but i am disappointed with the results i got from these it may be they do exactly what they are supposed to for some one with a very tender palate but not for me and in no case are these ever going to be rehydrated and served on steak they just stay too nasty of a product to serve by themselves strictly good for grinding and using in a recipe
negative,8/9/20,this product is a waste of money it is bitter bitter and salty salty save your money and by the peaches instead libby s unpeeled apricot halves in pear juice from concentrate ounce cans pack of
negative,22/9/21,upon opening the package i thought that the tea had absolutely no aroma and looked old as if it was sitting somewhere in an open container for months after brewing it revealed a bland taste at best it was like drinking brewed hay i checked the expiration date which is two years from now maybe i had a bad batch but it s going back i had a better experience with rishi organic jasmine pearl loose leaf tea i do not recommend this tea to anyone
negative,2/10/20,in order for tea to be labeled decaff is must be under caffeine when residue levels are tested a tea at caffeine is not decaff non decaff tea is anywhere between caffeine so at caffeine this is a caffeinated tea with caffeine slightly less than what is naturally present in the tea leaf
negative,25/7/20,unfortunately all package size descriptions on the product page are wrong these are not oz packages and they are also not oz packages as stated further down in the description they are oz packages very disappointed in this fact cherryheads are tasty though and the shipping was fast
negative,4/7/21,these are from china and nowhere as good as those from italy spend the extra money and get those from italy
negative,11/9/21,amazon pirated my personal image for their listing it is not a stock image i created it and put my website name on it looneystuff com for use on my website i have asked them to take my image down from this listing
negative,4/7/21,this pecan meal is more like bran flakes than pecans i had thought it was ground pecans and the name would indicate that the container it came in is very light which was my first clue it was not exactly the whole pecan nut meat the meal is flaky the price might have been a clue i suppose since the per pound price of pecans is over most places
negative,21/9/21,we purchased the pretzels to make chocolate covered wedding favors for our guests the pretzels would not have been bad for anything else but there were way too many broken ones we would have had to buy five more barrels my only complaint now is that we shipped them back over a month ago and still haven t received our refund
negative,11/9/21,they may have great products but shipping is incredibly slow shipped days after i placed the order not yet received and the shipping price is unreasonable
negative,12/10/21,do not be fooled this is not a health cereal the second ingredient is sugar and this cereal also has fructose in it i feel like i m eating kid cereal it would be healthy if it had less sugar in it carb conscious people and diabetics beware
negative,11/10/21,i tried this once and just tossed a whole box in the garbage the cereal looks like cinnamon toast crunch but it taste like some sort of fake caramel substitute it has a powdery coating that is worse than the butt end of a regular box of cereal with all the broken crumbs in the bottom the carmel flavor tastes fake and almost made me gag a few times
negative,28/9/21,fiber one products actually don t have real fiber they contain inulin from chicory root which is technically fiber because the body can t digest it unfortunately fiber is defined by anything that can t be broken down easily these products do not contain real fiber the real fiber usually found in whole grain breads and bran cereals so if it says chicory root or inulin in the ingredients you can be sure you aren t eating the fiber your body can actually use so if you want lots of sugar and fat without fiber this product is for you
negative,19/10/21,actually typed in smoked paprika this showed up so i ordered it and it is definatly not smoked also these bottles sell for at sam s so not only was it the wrong item but i over paid also
negative,4/7/21,it s all cayenne and not authentic bebere way too spicy threw it out and made my own
negative,11/9/21,my finicky cats wouldn t eat this food so i gave it to my neighbor who rescues cats so the food wouldn t go to waste
negative,12/9/21,when we first bought these we tried to eat one and couldn t looked at the ingredients and found its mostly pig hearts taste is awful our dog however thinks they are great so we cut them up in small pieces and hide them around for him or forage out by smell after about a week the contents of the bag start to mold since they are for the dog we washed them off and then store in the fridge too bad we had hoped these would be good snacks for football parties etc not recommended for people food
negative,13/7/21,oberto cocktail pep used to be so much better than this i had been buying them direct from the oberto online store for many years and i couldn t get enough no matter what size i ordered they were always excellent however in the past few years the quality of their cocktail pep has sure gone down they used to be very tight and snappy when you would bite into them the outer casing of each sausage was almost totally smooth because they were packed so tightly and they had a superior spicy flavor nowadays they are all soft and mushy with bland often stale flavor i get the impression that they are cutting corners to save a buck by not stuffing each sausage casing as tightly as they once did i believe this allows more air to permeate the meat and causes the bad flavor that many people are complaining about every year or so i get to craving those old style cocktail pep that i loved so much and i order a package hoping that they will have changed i keep thinking maybe i just got a bad batch last time but every time i am disappointed all over again
negative,23/10/21,when i first took a bite i seriously thought i was eating dog food these are disgusting i searched the bag for dog food and the expiration date thinking that it was bad for one of those reasons i don t know how anyone can like these
negative,22/9/21,they taste more like chemicals than meat i like a lot of jerky and meat sticks but would not eat these the dogs liked them though
negative,4/7/21,oh boy oberto cocktail pep smoked sausage sticks ounce bag purchased on this was the worst product i have ever tasted i have had many oberto products and this was nothing like what i ve eaten before even my dog wouldn t eat them they were so nasty tasting
negative,11/9/21,a word of caution to anyone considering buying these read the ingredients first i made the mistake of thinking they would be the same as the longer oberto brand ones our local costco used to sell so i ordered up bags to get the volume discount offered at the time i knew something wasn t right as soon as i opened up the first bag and got a whiff then i read the ingredients and was shocked when i saw that they actually use pork hearts as the top ingredient to eliminate any doubt i tasted one we ve been using them as expensive doggy treats ever since
negative,8/8/21,these quickly became dog treats just nasty i don t even know how they can sell these for human comsumption stay away
negative,9/7/21,only good use for these would be in case of poisoning use to induce vomiting
negative,24/10/21,very expensive and not worth the price try purityfarm organic ghee it s much cheaper and taste much better than this ghee don t waste your money
negative,4/7/21,i received this item and there was a tear in the packaging which had caused the dragees to spill all over the inside of the box they arrived in this isn t very surprising due to the type of plastic it s packaged in the sort which immediately rips open at the slightest puncture but as such it should have been packaged for shipping more carefully perhaps wrapped it in small bubble wrap and taping it securely as i ve seen done with other less fragile items i ve ordered i was especially annoyed however that there is no way of returning it that s just outrageous very very dissatisfied i have now tried ordering similar pearl dagrees from wilton wilton sugar pearls white oz which incidentally are less than half the price i should say that generally my experience with amazon and returns has been excellent the few dragees left in the package were beautiful uniform in shape and tasty i view this as an isolated incident due to the particular characteristics of this product its packaging however it could have been handled better
negative,11/9/21,why in the world would amazon want to sell an item and say can be ingested when it clearly has ingredients that can because cancer wish every state would wake up like california and ban all these cancer causing things
negative,24/10/21,i like the idea of getting grains out of cat food but using peas instead doesn t seem to be the answer carnivores at least my cat doesn t tolerate peas vomiting began in about weeks and is now instantaneous eat some cat food go right to throwing up both chicken and salmon so for me it was a waste of money and very disappointing
negative,22/6/21,i bought a couple of flavors from halo s both were not a hit with my cats unfortunately my cats would not touch it
negative,30/7/21,it taste okay but they are not soft and the taste doesn t stay very long i wouldn t buy them again
negative,10/7/21,i had a good experience with other amazon grocery products and these were a good deal so i bought a three pack they weren t horrible but they don t taste the same as the ones you buy in the store they taste like cheap generic chocolate chip cookies which is not necessarily bad but not what i expected for the price and chips ahoy brand they are cheaper tasting a little stale and much less chocolate chips i haven t had store bought chips ahoy for a few months so maybe they changed the formula for all these cookies but if not then these seem to be cheap knock offs made with cheaper ingredients
negative,4/7/21,my kids loves chips ahoy and i will have them once in a while as well but the kids refuse to eat them from this family size package once i tasted them i knew why they have an awful medicinal taste really bad i don t what the problem is but if you like chips ahoy you will not like these go elsewhere
negative,11/9/21,product is good my cats like it but the price just keeps climbing i will have to train my cats to eat cheaper cat food
negative,20/9/21,drawer is much larger than it appears in photo and takes up much more space on the cabinet surface the drawer is sticky and not easily opened or closed i would not purchase again
negative,13/10/21,ordered both had bent tracks and i actually cut my finger on one of the wires sticking out but you get what you pay for
negative,2/8/21,looks good but does not open and close smoothly the drawer has medal feet that fit into a groove in the bottom of the unit as a track the tray sticks a lot and you have to hold the top of the unit to jerk the drawer out
negative,11/6/21,i have never taken the time to write a review before but in this case others need to be warned off i expected to get a product similar to what i have seen in the stores but this obviously is a replica the sliders on the bottom of the tray that are supposed to keep the tray straight when you slide it in and out broke off before i even got it out of the package it is not something you can fix unless you have a solder gun even then it is very sticky pulling the tray out because there are no rollers it is metal on metal which does not work well without some sort of lubrication i love amazon but this product is inferior at best
negative,2/8/21,i ve been looking at this holder since i saw it at the at my office today i found it at bb b for it works great but too expensive at amozon
negative,18/10/21,i have tried many flavors of erin baker s breakfast cookies and until i tried this one i liked them all the ingredients list mentions that they have a touch of carrot cake spice added but it s more than a touch unless you really really love carrot cake you might want to make a different flavor selection my favorite is the chocolate chunk cherry but it appears it is only seasonal i wish i could get it all year long the oatmeal raisin is my second favorite i wish i had ordered them instead of these morning glory
negative,23/7/21,i really wanted to like these but i just found them to be to sweet sugary i generally stay away from cliff bars for the same reason and had hoped that these would be as good as they sound sadly its just to sweet tasting for me special note the packs i received oct have g sugar not the g listed in the amazon nutrition section there may have been a recipe change
negative,8/7/21,not kosher ignore the symbol they are not kosher and not certified by any company i contacted the company to confirm
negative,11/6/21,we picked these up based on the glowing reviews my fault my mistake i believe they are way over rated doesn t taste morning glory at all instead tastes just like any one of the other in the line dry stale dense oatmeal cookie like a cookie experiment gone bad by a pre teen in addition cookies arrived cracked broken and sticking to bag yet are dry stale inside what a waste i would have never purchased these in a b m store had i had an opportunity to examine them first
negative,25/6/21,the breakfast cookie is not to my liking and i do not think i will order them in the future
negative,2/8/21,i was disappointed by my first taste of kopali organics chocolate covered dried banana the chocolate is waxy and the bananas too soft for me i was expecting more crunch a drier banana the banana did not taste of banana to me either i will not purchase again
negative,11/6/21,it clearly states on the description pack of but i only got and i cannot find how to complain about this i don t want to return
negative,9/7/21,sesmark makes a very high quality rice cracker and then proceeds to ruin it by loading it up with so much salt as to make it inedible use caution before buying this item since there are no returns and you might find yourself with a throw away
negative,22/6/21,super bubble is my very favorite gum and very hard to find here the box i received was a real hit or miss more than half the gum was brick hard totally unchewable i ve never run across this issue with this product and am very disappointed i will take a chance and buy it again sometime in the future but this particular purchase left a bad taste in my mouth
negative,2/8/21,i would like to try this however i do not see anything that says exactly what this product is made of did i miss something they only say what it is not would really like to know
negative,11/6/21,i purchased my st order of miracle noodle directly from i got them for my mother because she needs to switch to a diet of less carbs and far less calories overall i purchased the pack of oz angel hair noodles for w for shipping for a total of a few days later i received the package i was very surprised to find out that each oz package of miracle noodles actually contained over ounces of water and less than oz of noodles while their marketing material does barely mention water content they are neither clear nor particularly forthcoming about this fact nor the fact that it accounts for over of the purchase product and considering the fact that they instruct you to immediately rinse the noodles before use it s not as if your supposed to prepare the noodle using this water well for a couple of reasons including but not limited to the water volume i decided to return them without opening even package so they were completely unused i was instructed during a phone call to their main office to mail them back at my expense and was told that i would receive a full refund well it cost me approx another to ship them back due to the water weight and a few days later i received a refund of i paid shipping both ways so basically i paid in shipping to get a so called refund i paid and got back only this may be legal but it is unethical and wrong and when i spoke to the rep on the phone this was never mentioned especially for a company that claims to stand behind it s product when i contacted them by email they informed me that this is our policy and cited the requisite schpeal on their website i was not informed of this on the phone call at all this so called policy should be changed it may be legal but it s hardly ethical or right when is ok to get back only half of what you spend when you return a product it s not not to mention the fact that you re getting less than oz of noodle in a oz package ridiculous oh and to make matters worse when i commented on their shipping policy and water weight on their facebook fan page instead of addressing the issues openly honestly and directly they immediately and repeatedly deleted my comments and then blocked me from making comments at all what s that tell you
negative,8/7/21,the shipment was prime but arrived in days instead of i love dark french roast coffee but this coffee tasted burnt and additionally the flavor had overtones of trash indonesian not a pleasant experience
negative,28/9/21,the juniper plant i received died within a month of planting after i did some research i found that it does the best outside of the home which eve s garden failed to mention in the product instructions i gave it one star because it shipped well and was fun while it lasted i will not be getting anything from this manufacturer again
negative,23/8/21,the bonzai i ordered came well before the estimated date however the tree i got as a gift was tiny nothing like it looks like in the product picture
negative,1/8/21,i know others like salt more than i do but i am not on a salt free diet or anything like that i love sausage but this was way too salty for my taste
negative,16/7/21,the taste is bitter the smell is atrocious and they are not naturally smoked aqueous natural smoke is a chemical stew injected into the fish for anyone thinking these are the real thing all i can say is there is a sucker born every minute
negative,2/8/21,i adore sardines i m used to the bela brand but decided to try these for variety s sake i opened up a can and it smelled like nasty cat food i tasted them anyway but was totally grossed out in the trash it went stick with bela super clean flavor fresh and better sourced totally different food product try them with siracha

negative,26/6/21,i ordered two of the hazer baa turkish apple tea pack of as pictured so i would save on the shipping and instead received the green apple tea same brand and price it didn t taste like the original but i didn t want the hassle of sending it back and so i will not be ordering it again this tea did not have the strength or zing of the original i m upset still
negative,20/8/21,the eggnog was not eggnog they should try another name as this is misleading the cartons are really difficult to open i use a screwdriver
negative,25/8/21,yes dogs love these treats but educate yourself before you buy any dog treats made in china per abc news just six months after issuing its latest warning about chicken jerky dog treats made in china the food and drug administration confirms it has logged more than complaints from pet owners who say their dogs either were sickened or died after eating the treats the number of complaints has nearly doubled since the story was first reported by abc news in march the fda says its investigation is ongoing and that it continues to test samples of the popular treats which dog owners across the country say have caused kidney failure in their pets resulting in severe illness or death
negative,19/10/21,please research on the web this product nearly killed my dog all of dogswell jerky treats are poison made in china this dist does not seem to care he is killing our pets fda told me dogs have died from these kind of dog treats beware i have over in vet bills amazon please don t sell this line to us talk with the fda dogswell happy hips for dogs chicken breast ounce pouches pack of find another product made in the usa before more of our furry friends get sick or die
negative,2/8/21,i honestly don t know how this product could have garnered so many five star reviews i bought it for my senior dogs years old when their usual joint treats pet naturals of vermont soft chews were out of stock since one of my dogs is very finicky about what glucosamine supplements he ll take and i had tried everything else available without success i gave both of them the recommended dosage based on their weights and lbs and was delighted to see that they happily accepted the treats within hours though my yorkie had raging diarrhea and my eskie poo had vomited forcefully which was very unusual for both of them not realizing it was this product i tried it again a couple of days after nursing them back to health with the exact same effect internet searches confirmed that other users have similarly reported nasty gi side effects with this product
negative,11/6/21,my dog loves chicken breast treats that is until i bought these i m sure this is simply a matter of taste i don t know if the additives smell different or what s turning him off but he ll pick it up and then just drop it he refuses to eat them at all
negative,22/10/21,i have fed the chicken and duck version of these though now the reviews regarding china i find disturbing regardless the beef liver version of these are not a hit with my pup and seem to be a very odd plastic texture the duck and chicken are both great but i will be investigating the source of the food
negative,6/8/21,consumer lab reports that in dogswell happy hips the condroitin level is not acceptable to low
negative,24/6/21,originally these were made in us now made in china see back of bag advertised as natural cage free no hormones no fillers no antibiotics huh not in china i will not trust these as safe treats follow up my dogs vomited after they ate these original warnings from fda re chicken product from china a follow up was issued by the fda again on to remain vigilant and of concern if fed to smaller dogs update dec all chicken jerky remains a problem according to the fda product from china noted again to be of concern some dogs made ill from chicken jerky product recovered with treatment and others have died the email from my vet stated that the fda would like you to report if you have a problem with chicken jerky treats
negative,17/4/21,i m disturbed that these treats as many reviewers state are so addictive my dog too loves them but has now begun to shun her meals and will only eat these treats in trying to make sense of her current state of anorexia i recently became aware of the fda advisory on dec stating that one of the symptoms to be aware of in dogs eating chicken jerky treats made in china is decreased appetite although some may continue to consume the treats to the exclusion of other foods so be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats although the dogswell company states clearly that their product is not contaminated and that third party testers have confirmed this do the owners of the company truly know what s happening in china behind the scenes or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky i and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog s anorexia except that it coincides with her increased interest and now only interest in happy hips since i began treating her with them last spring thankfully her kidney function is still fine but if you research this on the web many other dogs were not so lucky and died due to kidney failure see this link to the fda website suggesting caution to consumers in using chicken jerky products from china be informed
negative,10/3/21,i had bought this product last year my dog loved them but i subscribe to a couple of bichon frise newsgroup and they are saying not to feed these to your dog as they come from china i threw out what i had left for the outside critters in the forest i called dogswell today and they verified that even though they say you s on them they are still coming from china
negative,17/4/21,please be aware that although dogs absolutely love these treats that they may have caused a recent unexplainable illness in our month old mastiff pup he was getting or a day of these chicken jerky s for about a week and then suddenly became very lethargic along with vomiting diarrhea and had no appetite except he would eat only these treats and drink water vet thinks he ll recover ok but advised us to stop feeding them to our dogs these are still made in china and in reports had shown that dogs were getting sick from these and other brands and there are still reported cases today just be careful and watch your pets closely if you are feeding them these we will no longer feed these to any of our dogs ever wish dogswell would manufacturer these in the usa again
negative,21/1/21,these chicken strips and most others like them are priced so low they are hard to resist my dogs love them of course and for dogs who tolerate chicken they should be excellent treats however i do not trust pet foods sourced from china most of you should remember the melamine disaster of several years ago that killed and permanantly injured over ten thousand pets it remains almost impossible to determine the conditions under which chinese food products are produced and manufactured the rumors in the veterinary world i am a dvm are that the majority of the chickens used in these cheap products are dead before processing no one has any clue what if any adulterants are added many brands are irradiated if this matters to you overall i recommend purchasing pet food products that the manufacturer guarantees are made from us grown and processed ingredients
negative,30/1/21,we have been ordering these chicken jerky treats for a long time with amazon subscribe and save my boston terriers really love them and get very excited to get their treat every morning when i opened a bag from my most recent shipment my dogs refused to take the treat from my hand they took one sniff and backed away my son s lab got very sick from chicken jerky made in china and his vet told him to only buy treats made in the you s and i m going to follow that advice
negative,13/2/21,made in china does anything else need to be said i used to buy them then noticed the label i will not buy again
negative,15/1/21,i am very disappointed that this happy hips product is made in china now if it wasn t for me going into a pet food store that doesn t carry products not made in the usa i would be still feeding this product to my dog i am really concerned on finding a new product due to my bichon s allergies she can only have lamb she now sits at the cabinet and cries for her treat i think i may need to make my own lamb jerkey in my dehydrator more work but worth it with no regulations in china who knows what is swept from the floors and put in the product as we know the packaging is misleading what is misleading in the ingredents i have been to china it is scary we take so much for granted in the usa dp
negative,6/3/21,my dogs loved this product and i was happy to spend the money on it but now that it s made in china thumbs down what were they thinking i ll never buy it again there are better products made in the usa if you care about the well being of your dog you will avoid products made in china
negative,8/6/21,i will no longer be giving these to my dog they caused my dog to have diarrhea and vomit when i did some more research online there were many many posts about how the treats caused their dogs to have similar and even much more severe health issues my dog loves these treats i have been giving these to her for about a year or two now every once in a while she would have diarrhea or start vomiting a yellow foamy substance in most cases both and i finally now linked it to these treats do your research before you buy this product however i would not recommend these at all
negative,7/1/21,i wish i had read that these are made in china before i bought them they are going in the trash lesson learned
negative,17/4/21,i bought this product last week for our dogs within a day both were vomiting and refusing food our larger dog is doing ok since we stopped feeding them but our little guy is not taking both to the vet tomorrow along with these treats
negative,10/3/21,admittedly my dog loves these treats and thinks they are delicious however they are made in china and dog lovers in the us usually choose not to buy products from china due to prior problems with the quality control that has sickened many animals dogswell should take note of this and manufacture them in the us it should also be noted that competitive brands on your grocery store shelves are also made in china even though distributed in california the only brand i have found that is manufactured in the us is from trader joes if you love your dog do not buy this item go to trader joes
negative,14/1/21,used to subscribe to this item as my dogs loved them but i just found that they are made in china i will never feed these to my dogs again or buy anything from the company
negative,24/5/21,dogswell happy hips for dogs chicken breast ounce pouches pack of dogswell chicken jerky is now made in china the fda has warned against dog food products made in china don t risk it
negative,14/10/21,i purchase almost daily from amazon and recommend amazon to my friends constantly i think that makes me a very good customer i have a very serious concern when amazon sells pet food and or treats made in china they must be disclosed on the amazon page as made in china no one who loves their pet will buy them but amazon will at least give us a fair chance to protect our beloved pets from these poisons imported from china as a loyal customer i expect amazon to protect me and my loved ones from hidden threats amazon must disclose the country of origin for all food products if amazon is too ashamed to disclose the source then amazon should not sell it
negative,7/2/21,i used to buy these all the time and had no idea the switched to being made in china not trusting this company anymore they just lost another customer buyer beware
negative,29/3/21,my dogs love duck treats and have been getting the chicken happy hips for years so i though i d give the duck a try bad idea the treat was too tough and stringy for my small female westie to pull apart and she ended up choking and vomiting i order by subscription and had to make cuts in the strips with a poultry shear to use up the bags i too hate the fact that these are made in china but my little guys need extra condroitin and glucosamine so i m back to the chicken formula
negative,17/4/21,my dog absolutely loves these and she is very picky however i am returning them due to the numorous recent cases of illnesses and deaths occurring from chicken treats that have been manufactured in china it is not worth the risk to me sadly to say i will have to find another brand
negative,10/3/21,my dogs loved these treats recently my yr old hound that has never been to the vet got sick couldn t keep anything down and after days of this we went to pet emergency later it was concluded that it was something digested not possible i spare no expense when it comes to my furry buddy s i grabbed the bags of treats and sure enough made in china went to fda web site in and they said chicken from china bad but no recalls yet dogs have been getting sick from chicken products from china advised not to buy called company and no return call trashed them all
negative,10/7/21,my shih tzu loved these and i have been giving him these duck treats off and on for the past two years with no obvious problem even though they are made in china ordinarily i would not give my dog anything made in china but i could not find any duck treats made in the usa well recently i purchased a large package of these at a pets warehouse store i would wake up and find throw up and diarrhea in the house seemingly every time i gave him a duck treat the day before i didn t want to believe it i thought perhaps his water bowl was slimy and cleaned it all was well i gave him another duck treat a few days later and he got sick again several hours later well i stopped giving him dogswell happy hips duck treats and he has been fine since then so i don t know if it s just a bad batch of treats or if he somehow became sensitive to these treats or if they are contaminated with something not going to take any more chances with this brand
negative,27/1/21,my labrador loves all the treats from dogswell however all of the dogswell jerky treats i have come across are made in china as a dog lover i cannot knowingly give my dog a product from china it does say cage free but really i m not sure but dogswell jerky bars are made in the usa my dog loves this just as much so bad news on the regular jerky but upside dogswell has some usa products too
negative,1/6/21,my dog loved these treats then one day i actually read the packaging and saw these are made in china i feel betrayed by this company who pretends they use organic free range chicken when really those words do not exist in chinese farming practices they buy meat from one of the largest makers of dog food in china a massive factory and are fully aware of the fda issued warnings about chicken products from china killing pets they state they test for everything but since the contaminant has not been pinpointed yet it is impossible to test for don t give your dog these treats do your research and read every label closely as they really try and fool you with the fine print
negative,20/8/21,i ve been buying dogswell chew treats for my dog for several years she s always loved them the most recent time i purchased them however she got seriously ill with heavy vomiting and lethargy i almost forgot about it but a few weeks later i found them in the back of the cabinet and tried them again she got very ill again especially since she s rarely sick it s difficult to ignore the link between these treats and her illness unless and until there s some quality control on these i highly recommend finding a different treat as for the issue of made in china i only looked at the packaging more carefully after reading some reviews and in fact the packaging clearly states that the product is made in china i find that pretty incredulous considering the claims on the packaging about all natural and even free range definately beware
negative,14/8/21,i wish i had come to the amazon site before purchasing this product at my local wegman s the product of china was printed so small it was easy to overlook i am a little shocked that wegman s a local chain store known for quality was selling these treats in a big display the half open package is going in the trash and unopened bag is going back to wegman s for a refund and a piece of my mind
negative,21/4/21,in my opinion its an outrage that these treats which used to be made in the us are now made in china the company did not advertize anywhere about this and we only found out accidentally while looking at the wrap for ingredients let me start my review stating that many of the current star ratings here look suspiciously fake made up its hard to imagine anyone writing something positive about them unless they fail to see reviews clearly warning buyers about these treats being made in china hard to blame chinese to manufacture them but its dogwells fault for not realizing dangers of making them there with their poor record in food manufacturing from the past with food poisoning in pet food
negative,1/4/21,i had been buying my year old bichon frise these happy hips duck treats for months until recently when i purchased a large bag that upon opening it reeked of some sort of chemical substance which smelled very much like chlorine or bleach the smell was overwhleming and disgusting not knowing what was wrong with it just out of curiosity i looked on the back of the bag to read the contents and sure enough at the bottom of the bag were those dreaded words made in china up until this time i had assumed their treats were made in the usa and some of them are but after looking through all their products it seems that their duck and chicken breast treats come from china do not trust this product
negative,17/4/21,i didn t mind paying the a bag because my dog loved them these are so expensive that i didn t look on the bag to see where they were made until another recent recall on chinese dog treats food that was killing dogs when i looked at the happy hips bag i was pretty ticked off to see that these are made in china i used to joke that my dog was addicted to these but now i am actually a little concerned that there may be some addictive substance in these chinese treats
negative,10/3/21,i used to get these instore and found a cheaper deal on amazon i recently realize when you open the bag there s a strong smell like plastic or chemicals i tried a little bit myself and the smell is just so strong that i can t bear it i tossed everything everything away and would not buy this again it s made in china you don t know what they put in the chicken strips to get them addicted or sick avoid
negative,22/4/21,all of the veterinary products made in china are potentially dangerous to your pet do not buy pet products made in china along with the melamine issues of a few years ago there have been reports of salmonella on these so called treats additionally there are no good studies showing any efficacy of glucosamine for the treatment of arthritis and amazon should make it easier to find the country of origin of all of their products
negative,25/4/21,i placed an order for dogswell happy hips for dogs beef liver on on july when my current supply was used up i opened the new batch started with one pouch and then a second pouch for the first time the product doesn t appear to be healthy and fresh instead of being solid brown hard and crispy the beef liver pieces are soft pliable and some have a whitish powdery covering on them i m afraid to feed these to my dogs or other dogs that i meet in the park i ve been buying this product for years and this is the first time it doesn t look and feel right i m going to try to get an exchange hoping that this is just a bad batch one thing i did notice when the package arrived and that is the long tall plastic bag was substituted with a horizontal short bag that didn t fit the pouches very well my guess is that another manufacturer is making this dog treat not the original one and that s the reason for the inferior and unhealthy quality of the treats
negative,1/4/21,i have bought these for a long time and felt better about the product because i believed them to be of american origin i purchased several bags strips wrapped apples etc and now realize the country of origin is china with all the fda regulations about packaging it s about time it was mandated that country of origin be prominently displayed like in font type not microscopic writing no one notices on the front of the package as a result i will no longer purchase dogswell products as an aside rawhide is an even worse offender since the dog can get a much higher dose of any toxins used in curing the hide and you can bet there are plenty i even picked up a package of a brand named something like you s a rawhide and on the back in fine print was made in china why aren t our legislators doing something productive and cracking down on this it s sneaky at best and intentionally deceptive at worst amazon please find us products for our furry kids that won t make them sick or kill them
negative,30/6/21,my dog used to love these i thought i was was giving him a great treat that was actually a supplement to improve his arthritis symptoms then his liver enzymes were elevated and he was becoming less active and always thirsty thank goodness a friend sent me a link about the fda warnings since hundreds of dogs have died very painful and expensive deaths if you love your dog go to the fda website yourself and do not buy these treats
negative,1/3/21,my otherwise healthy papillon was doing great before feeding these to him he is normally pretty fussy about which treats he likes so when i found these i thought i had hit a gold mine however over time i saw behavior changes a normally laid back dog getting first hyper then lethargic i took him to the vet and they saw that his liver and kidneys were being compromised in his lab work that s when i started looking into everything he was eating and noticed that these are made in china i did not check for this initially because i purchased them at whole foods and wf has guidelines before a food can get on the shelves i am concerned that while these treats may not have caused death they are having an adverse effect on some pets three weeks after i took him off these this food his lab values returned to normal i noticed several other reviews here from pet owners with similar issues to mine i am giving them star because there is no button for stars
negative,29/1/21,okay a lot of chicken breast treats from china are causing dogs to be sick see the fda website for details this is not one of them but when i started buying it it was made in the usa now it s made in china although my dogs have long loved this treat i m in the process of searching for a replacement made in a safe country
negative,17/4/21,i have been feeding these to our dog for years to help her with her joints especially her hips ever since i started her on these as a treat meaning i gave her one in the morning and another in the evening she regained her active self and they helped her get interested in her regular meals it was a win win situation for our finicky eater however i would like to note that when i started her on these treats they were being made in the usa resentfully i discovered that they are now produced in china as we know china produces some very high end products and some real crap as well however when it comes to food products that come from overseas a warning flag goes up in my mind especially if they are coming from china personally i never noticed anything odd with our year old dog s reaction to happy hips still i decided that i did not want to subject her to a food product coming out of china does anyone know of another product like happy hips with glucosamine for the joints in it that is produced in the usa
negative,10/3/21,plenty of articles have been written about the danger and disease s caused by chinese made dog treats these treats are made in china plenty of healthy usa made treats available avoid these at all costs after the latest information was released i tried to return to amazon but they said no please do not buy these treats
negative,30/5/21,my dog became very ill vomiting diarrhea excruciating pain in mid oct and spent three days at the emergency vet and cost us they ruled out a bunch of things and were only able to say that he might have irritable bowel disease but the biopsy to find out for certain would cost us an additional he did recover without the test and came home and is on a special gastrointestinal diet now however i have to say that i had a large bag of these in my cupboard when he became ill and used them regularly as the treat of choice to get him in his crate i can t say for sure that these were the because but i won t be buying any dog food products treats or otherwise that are made in china treats made in the usa only for us
negative,28/9/21,i ordered three packages because the price was so good then i saw this i am asking amazon for a refund otherwise they are going in the trash unused copied from fda web site fda continues to caution dog owners about chicken jerky products november the food and drug administration fda is again cautioning consumers that chicken jerky products for dogs also sold as chicken tenders strips or treats may be associated with illness in dogs in the last months fda has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from china these complaints have been reported to fda by dog owners and veterinarians fda issued a cautionary warning regarding chicken jerky products to consumers in september and a preliminary animal health notification in december of after seeing the number of complaints received drop off during the latter part of and most of the fda is once again seeing the number of complaints rise to the levels of concern that prompted release of our earlier warnings chicken jerky products should not be substituted for a balanced diet and are intended to be fed occasionally in small quantities fda is advising consumers who choose to feed their dogs chicken jerky products to watch their dogs closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products decreased appetite decreased activity vomiting diarrhea sometimes with blood increased water consumption and or increased urination if the dog shows any of these signs stop feeding the chicken jerky product owners should consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than hours blood tests may indicate kidney failure increased urea nitrogen and creatinine urine tests may indicate fanconi syndrome increased glucose although most dogs appear to recover some reports to the fda have involved dogs that have died fda in addition to several animal health diagnostic laboratories in the you s is working to determine why these products are associated with illness in dogs fda s veterinary laboratory response network vlrn is now available to support these animal health diagnostic laboratories to date scientists have not been able to determine a definitive because for the reported illnesses fda continues extensive chemical and microbial testing but has not identified a contaminant the fda continues to actively investigate the problem and its origin many of the illnesses reported may be the result of causes other than eating chicken jerky veterinarians and consumers alike should report cases of animal illness associated with pet foods to the fda consumer complaint coordinator in their state or go to
negative,6/5/21,just a word of warning this product is made in china where they may add a substance that can because serious kidney problems in dogs read the blog on the topic of chicken dog treats made in china after reading the many comments posted by dog owners who fed they dogs chicken treats made in china i am discarding all of these treats and will seek an alternative product that is made in the usa
negative,20/4/21,fda just issued yet another warning for dog chicken jerky treats made in china dog lovers you need to pay attention we just threw our stuff in the trash yet another health article appeared on cnn online re dog chicken jerky treats i re read the reviews on amazon i contacted dogswell customer service and got a lengthy very informative reply that said a large number of our products are sourced and manufactured in the united states and only a small number of our treats are made in china my package clearly states made in china so did i buy that small number of bags i carefully weighed all the information and still do not feel comfortable i believe the manufacturer cares a lot about dogs but how about keeping the business right here in the usa we just made the decision to stop ordering this product yes my dogs like the treats but i cannot in my heart say i can serve them to my pups i am unconvinced that this is the best option for my dogs
negative,20/4/21,i don t trust dog treats made in china as an alternative there s a good chicken jerky dog treat made by goodness gracious in the usa and using human grade chicken
negative,21/4/21,i have been giving these chews to my mini pincher and mini dauchand for the past years to help support their joints and hips the last batch i bought is darker in color to the point of almost being burnt and smells a lot more it made my mini pincher sick to the point of vomiting and liquid stools i am going to shop for a better product that is made here in the us i have been looking at gnc products for dogs and that is probably the route i will take
negative,2/5/21,i bought these from a large chain pet store after reading the reviews i checked the bag made in china i threw the whole bag away i wish i would have read the reviews first
negative,18/12/19,good thing i got this from the bargain bin or i would really be perturbed whatever the claims this mix has no chocolate flavor of any kind a more correct description would be coconut flavored drink mix apparently the oz rating is including the weight of the cauldron because there s no way there was oz of product inside you might get three cups of hot chocolate per container if you like the flavor really mild it really wasn t worth the price i paid and certainly not the inflated regular price two of the three cauldrons were dented heavily so those won t even be much use as decoration look for a better brand
negative,19/1/20,this is one of my favorite cereals but purchase it only if you don t mind eating it in powder form what you get is mostly powder not crunchy squares i will not be ordering again sorry
negative,19/1/20,while taste is ok it s simply using too many artificial colors blue red yellow yellow approved by fda doesn t mean it s healthy and other chemicals bht etc to be used by children if you re going to eat it yourself take your chances but since there are many good and healthy alternatives why bother
negative,31/3/20,i was disappointed to receive earth s best organic snakin fruit rings banana because it hurt my child when she bit into the hard and stale treat
negative,18/12/19,we ordered the product and received broken bottles but amazon is excellent and reshipped the entire order again one day shipping unfortunately even at cents a bottle we overpaid there is no cheese taste and it is really just a salty mess now we have bottles of a below average product save your money
negative,13/10/19,absolutely no cheese flavor at all all you can taste is salt salt salt save your money and try something else
negative,28/9/20,if you like cheese seasoning on your popcorn this product will not deliver it tastes like they should instead of putting anything cheese related on the label they should say improved salt flavoring that will stick to popcorn more than salt i would recommend anything by kernal season s brand that tastes like cheese but if you like a salty tasting popcorn this is the seasoning for you
negative,16/11/20,i bought this at a local albertsons recently and it is not at all as advertised there is no cheesy flavor detectable in the product even the salt flavor is off avoid this product
negative,27/2/20,reese changed their cheesy popcorn seasoning it is more salt than cheese in fact it has very little cheese flavor left i will not be purchasing this product again
negative,26/2/21,this is an okay gift box only if you like mediocre cheese and summer sausage the items are small smaller than they appear in the picture i only paid but i would not purchase it again on the positive side the mustard samples that come with it make the items edible
negative,18/12/19,it looks llike i just walked into a raw deal the item is intolerably stale and there is no recourse i am simply stuck with it i love licorice and have bought gustaf s licorice on amazon before to much enjoyment what i received here is a junky plastic bag unsuitable to preserve the product containing product that clearly is too old and has not been kept under proper storage conditions add to that labeling is generic and apparently this item contains wheat in substantial quantities not what i know from my brand name gustaf s licorice packages those disclaimers on the item descriptions regarding ingredients may differ are utterly pointless and plain not ok how does that do anything other than cover the vendor s rear clearly customers get no choice and might wind up with expensive purchases of allergy triggers strike one utterly stale strike two not returnable strike three no declaration of ingredients pre purchase only offensive legal see ya just about every packaged food or supplement i can purchase in a store falls under clear fda guidelines for labeling food safety storage conditions materials expiration date those rules are growing on me i am a strong buyer and i shall refrain from any such purchases moving forward not only is it too risky and pricey if duped with degraded product it is also an inexcusable trap who wants to get stuck with waste and have their money taken amazon is not what i d remembered it to be
negative,19/1/20,thank god that i tasted the metal before i swallowed them i do not even get how it got mixed up with this the candy itself is sex in mouth
