positive,18/6/21,this is a very healthy dog food good for their digestion also good for small puppies my dog eats her required amount at every feeding
positive,7/7/21,i ve been very pleased with the natural balance dog food our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and i had someone recommend natural balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains since switching i haven t had any issues it is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger smaller sized dogs
positive,18/6/21,before i was educated about feline nutrition i allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food i always offered both canned and dry but wish i would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food i have two year old cats and two year old cats the only good quality dry foods they will eat are wellness and innova innova s manufacturer was recently purchased by procter gamble i began looking for a replacement after once again offering several samples from my local holistic pet store holistic select was the only one other than the usual wellness and innova they would eat for finicky cats i recommend trying holistic select it is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters
positive,7/7/21,my holistic vet recommended this along with a few other brands we tried them all but my cats prefer this especially the sardine version the best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear and and i don t want to be rude so i ll say this as delicately as i can their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the mcdonalds junk found in most stores which is a definite plus for me the health benefits are so obvious i highly recommend holistic select
positive,1/7/21,i bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the ganocafe and has the organic reishi mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidants i didn t expect it to taste good but it actually does i ve only had it for a few days and for its totally worth it my sisters all take ganocafe but now i m introducing them to this less expensive similar coffee i will follow up on this product in a few weeks
positive,7/7/21,like the other people mentioned this coffee has a great taste i ve tried different instant coffees before but this one is one of the better ones another one of my favorites if you want to try it out though not organic is africafe pure instant coffee
positive,23/7/21,a good tasting light chip that has some value in nutrition everyone get the munchies is this is a good alternative to eating potato chips
positive,20/7/21,a grande item delicious fish with the ultimate flavor best ever in a can for all purposes i sent a case to my mother recently diagnosed with diabetes and she loves it as a main entree for cooking patties
positive,19/7/21,i ordered this product two times now and have been very happy with both the delivery and the product it works great for cooking baking and as a substitute sugar in my chai lattes
positive,18/6/21,this stuff is great because it s low glycemic substitute this to sugar and you ll be doing your body a great favor this size is economical and shipping is fast too i got mine very soon
positive,7/7/21,these chips are the only ones i found to be tasty and healthy they have fewer fat calories plus higher fiber for those who want good taste and nutrition the perfect blend
positive,27/6/21,i used to buy these at the local supermarket but they are no longer carried there finding them on amazon i purchased a box and found they were fresh and delicious as i remembered for chips they are also very healthy i definately will buy them again
positive,21/7/21,i ve been feeding liver biscotti for years i was looking for a healthy treat without additives for my epileptic dog additives can be a seizure trigger and liver biscotti filled the bill the ingredients are top quality the bite size bits are perfect for training and don t muck up your pockets the bite size portions also make it possible to give rewards without adding pounds which is a problem with other treats and for dogs with wheat and other sensitivities there is an anti allergenic recipe enthusiastically recommended
positive,18/6/21,i got these for my gf as she isn t supposed to eat any gluten all of the flavors taste great and they seem to be much healthier than regular potato chips if you are looking for a gluten free snack i highly recommend popchips
positive,7/7/21,i have a free sampling of these chips and i can see me swapping them for my regular chip cravings they remind me of munchos but are less greasy try them
positive,30/6/21,i tried this chips in a hotel that i stayed at and loved them i ordered them for the office and everyone enjoyed them i m on my second order
positive,1/7/21,i absolutely love pop chips as a healthy alternative to regular fatty chips the seat salt and pepper and the sour cream and onion are my favorites i don t crave regular chips at all
positive,24/8/21,i picked up a few bags of these at my local heb and could not help but consume half of a bag in a day the entire stock did not last even a week for me many chips say they have a bold flavor but they never deliver these however do i tried the garlic parmessan chips and the first things i thought was how strong and delicious the parmessan was shortly followed by a garlic flavor combined with a sharp crunch i cannot have enough of these chips i m almost afraid to buy a pack because i know they won t last a month it also helps that these things are pretty healthy for you i mean they are a potato crisp so you can t be entirely guilt free but i don t knock myself for going to town i just avoid the potato chip aisle these are on when i need to lay low on the snack foods
positive,21/7/21,i love these chips they always make a great healthy snack when i m stuck at work with just the vending machine for sustenance
positive,25/6/21,the sun chips are an ok substitute for the usual potato corn whatever chip cooked in oil and over salted they are not nearly as un palatable as i thought they would be have added them to my heart healthy diet regime all are good except for the multi grain style which has the texture of a sheet of plywood
positive,13/9/21,this chips are really good and it s fun getting the variety pack now are they as good as regular chips probably not but they re also not nearly as fattening and bad for you as regular chips given that these are a healthier version if you want chips i would highly recommend them
positive,18/6/21,tried the bbq popchips for the first time and loved them so got the value pack to try more flavors loved them all except the salt and pepper chips which weren t that great good healthy snack without giving up the taste so glad i discovered these salt and vinegar are my favorite cal bag g fat bag
positive,7/7/21,we ll see how these work out in our family over time i m not sure that i am disciplined enough to make good use of them although it might be a good technique for teaching my dog they appear to be good for what they are a very tiny but healthy reward right now i can visualize them being used as a reward for following commands a training tool i was surprised at how tiny these treats were they seem to taste good enough but they are miniscule they are just a fraction longer than a small paperclip and about half as wide maybe as thick my dog was a little annoyed but took it when i gave it to him that was yesterday today he came in excited to get his treat looked at it as if to say you ve got to be kidding then he took it and ate it a little later i offered him another one he put it on the floor and looked hopefully at his stash of larger treats but when he didn t get one he went back and took this one i think these might be good for rewards for obeying commands treats that s stretching it they may also be good for my son s dog who rarely gets treats because she s overweight and would eat the whole entire refrigerator full of food if allowed at least she would get a treat large treats take her seconds she ll probably inhale these one second max i like the fact that these are low fat with no added salt no refined sugar no artificial flavors colors or preservatives it says treats baked with natural peanut butter
positive,15/7/21,i am a mom of kids with my older two i had such a hard time finding a snack for them that didn t have so much sodium when my rd came along happyfamily introduced happymunchies i was so thankful to find a snack low in sodium and with a vegetable too and to top it off it is organic so i know it is free of pesticide residue and gmos
positive,11/7/21,we love these baby food things in a little pouch sooooo much easier to feed to a baby or toddler on the go our son loves sucking the fruit out and we are pleased that it is both organic and healthy with nothing added just fruit for smaller ones not good to let them handle it themselves because they love to squeeze it which gets things everywhere but older ones can feed to themselves i like the size rather than the bigger one that plum organics has for some of the other flavors it assures that he will eat all or most of it in one sitting rather than having to save some for later you can also take this size on airplanes without having to have it tested for explosives not the case with the bigger pouches i also like that it is bpa free if your little one likes them ordering in bulk and with subscribe and save makes them much cheaper than at the store
positive,7/10/21,i love vitamuffins but my supermarket sells one box of muffins for instead i bought the mix boxes for and each box makes muffins instead of per muffin the mix only requires water eggs and works out to about cents per muffin and very easy to make that s a great deal
positive,6/7/21,i generally like vitalicious products the corn muffin well for calories it s not bad but if you are expecting anything like the sugar fat laden junk that your local bakery sells look elsewhere this is like a healthy makeover that doesn t quite cut it but they re not bad for the same amount of calories the chocolate one is more of an indulgence but this one is good for a bland breakfast treat especially baked fresh my kids are happy to get any extra snacks so they approve i send with them to school for a midmorning snack i am glad they get fuel and vitamins
positive,18/6/21,my dog had been prone to ear infections and did a lot of paw chewing when his vet recommended changing his diet because his symptoms may be due to a food allergy she specifically recommended the salmon and rice formula unfortunately my dog hated the salmon and rice and it smelt extremely fishy i tried the lamb and rice formula and he likes it much better i ve heard numerous good things about wellness from my dog trainer as well as other pet owners and pet store employees my dog is adjusting to the new food well however i can tell he doesn t consider it the most tasty of choices probably because it doesn t have the artificial flavoring in it but i d rather him eat something much healthier even if we have to sacrifice a little on the taste
positive,7/7/21,length mins these cookies are so great watch our video to see how great they really are
positive,27/7/21,actually sojo s strongly recommends that the meat you add to their mixes be raw but it an be cooked as i choose to do my dog arrived with coccidia and giardia as a puppy through veterinary mismanagement he was never completely healthy for the first years of his life after watching him get sicker on an aggressive course of antibiotics and prednisone for his inflammatory bowel disease i took him to a holistic veterinarian part of his treatment has been a homemade diet of sojo s and meat plus no medications i m extremely pleased to report he has had no gi episodes in over months and has reached a point where i consider him healthy his coat is glossy and much fluffier than before he s finally at a good weight i have before and after photos that show a dramatic improvement much of which i credit to sojo s it does take some extra time to prepare as opposed to kibble but i make days worth at a time this takes me about minutes total which includes down time while the meat is cooking and cleaning up after to be completely honest i m not thrilled about cooking for my dog but i am thrilled with the results if i was able to feed him raw perhaps down the road when our vet gives the ok preparation time would be almost nothing
positive,13/7/21,it s also a routine baking ingredient i put it into my bread along with sunflower seeds and organic wheat flour i also put it into my smoothie stir fry dishes anything you can think of good price and really it s a must have for a healthy diet
positive,13/9/21,i have tryed the almond crunch and is delicious and healthy snack better than chips try it you ll agree
positive,7/9/21,i use the powdered tea powder in my fruit smoothies provides you all the health benefits of green tea love the product and use both the plain and lemon ginger
positive,17/4/21,green tea is good for you loaded with antioxidants boosts your metabolism yadda yadda yadda but i never quite warmed up to the taste until now the lemon and the ginger give this a very nice flavor and it is so great that i can just add a packet to my water bottle and go without the bother of brewing it
positive,10/3/21,i eat a lot of cereal and that includes a lot of the high fiber kinds oatmeal mini frosted shredded wheat and raisin bran are usually what i d eat when i needed to lose a few lbs but there have been a few instances where i tried the healthier options i ve tried several of the kashi cereals but they weren t very appetizing the plain one had a cardboard taste next i tried grape nuts which is like a horrendous yeast flavored cat food though it s closer to kitty litter in texture that brings me to fiberplus antioxidants this berry yogurt crunch is certainly one of the better tasting high fiber cereals i ve eaten it s like a decent health bar broken apart into cereal the clusters of yogurt really help but even the plain cereal is decent enough on its own yes there are g of sugar per serving but the g of fiber and calorie parts more than make up for it especially if you compare it to raisin bran and frosted shredded wheat which are typically higher in sugar and calories yet lower in dietary fiber the antioxidants are a nice bonus too the bottom line is that i ll add this to my grocery list whenever it s on sale or the price is right
positive,17/4/21,i don t know why science diet is being referred to as junk food as it is one of the higher quality foods on the market a lot of the new organic and natural cat foods are not as healthy for pets as they are cracked up to be but regardless my veterinarian wanted me to put my year old cat on a prescription food because of the high count of crystals in her urine after some comparisons science diet mature adult active longevity is the closest to the prescription food both my cats the younger one and the older are on this food and they seem to enjoy it they both graze all day and are indoor cats so i try my best not to overfeed them my younger cat has not had issues with her urine since she went on this food and we are all happy
positive,21/1/21,these chocolate sandwich creme cookies by whonu are every bit as delicious as similar brands but they are healthier for you true they have almost the same sugar fat and carb amounts of the best known name brand of these cookies but as others have noted they also give you fiber with noticeably more vitamins and minerals than that other brand this is a plus they re really good as a snack and it s hard to stop at the serving size of just three cookies but i guess i m allowed an occasional guilty pleasure as i write this they are a bit too expensive on this website try looking for these cookies elsewhere unless you want the convenience of having them shipped to your door overall these awesome chocolate sandwich creme cookies by whonu are the best i definitely recommend them as an excellent healthier alternative to the major name brand of this type of cookie i love them enjoy
positive,30/1/21,we like this brownie mix and i usually use the low fat recipe on it i also add chocolate chips or something else to it otherwise it ends up a little bit dry we still buy this by the case
positive,13/2/21,these brownies are good but the flax seed texture can be a real turn off to minimize it i added a little whole wheat flour splenda and cocoa big improvement and my guests never complained like they did the first time i made the brownies
positive,15/1/21,we just got our first order a few days ago and my month old daughter loves them they re just like the gerber mini veggies but much cheaper although they still cost a good bit having a nutrient filled easy to take anywhere travel snack is well worth it my daughter doesn t have any teeth yet and she hasn t had any problems eating them they re light and fluffy yet full of flavor
positive,6/3/21,i am not sure why the speciality stores in my area stopped carrying these as they were usually sold out the cakes are calories crunchy and good not like the cardboard taste of thicker rice cakes excellent as a base for pb j or to make an open face sandwich or to use in pieces like a chip for dips etc good price on the pack with a month expiration use date
positive,8/6/21,i purchased these based on others recommendations the rice cakes are delicious thinner than the usual rice cakes in the supermarkets dense not full of air i covered them with pb those watching their weight can eat peanut butter for calories a serving vs for regular pb and it tastes exactly the same i too highly recommend these rice cakes
positive,7/1/21,over of dry dog food is very unhealthy and can not even get or stars out of or diamond naturals is a great food i have afghans and i ve spent many many hours of research to find this out
positive,17/4/21,this is a very good snack that i feel great about offering my month old she can easily pick up the small pieces and definitely enjoys the apple cinnamon taste my year old loves them as well i would definitely recommend these to anyone with small or larger kids
positive,14/1/21,sardines are a useful item to stock for times when you want to add a bit of protein to your meal without breaking the bank i like that they are lower in mercury than big fish are and high in omega fats the skinless ones are much better tasting in my opinion regular sardines taste a bit too oily fishy and strong to me they are fairly neutral with the absence of added oil or much salt and this makes them versatile i sometimes add lemon and mayonnaise for a sandwich filling mix with egg oatmeal onion and lemon and fry for a fish patty or add them to a salad although i think these from roland are very good i liked the seasons skinless sardines which are also sold by amazon even better for flavor and texture
positive,24/5/21,stores are not carrying this product thank goodness i can still get them genisoy soy crisps deep sea salted ounce bags pack of
positive,14/10/21,i was really surprised when i tried this product because i found it to be a really light fluffy batter so don t think gluten free means flavorless this bisquick pancake mix will have you building up stacks of fluffy pancakes for your family it s so nice that these are healthier for you diabetic friendly and still manage to taste great too
positive,7/2/21,i have a year old scottish terrier who has some food allergies no wheat for my girl this treat is great for settleing an upset stomach and my dog looks forward to her charcoal bone treats
positive,29/3/21,i highly recommend these very tasty kavli thin crispbreads i wanted something different than just white bread for sandwiches i hate whole wheat i love rye i saw these noticed the ingredients couldn t get much simpler and gave them a try topped with cheese or a sandwich spread or whatever you d like they re very tasty i feel as full after or of these topped of course as i did with just white bread they re nice and thin so it isn t like biting into anything hard just a nice crunch the flavor isn t strong at all it is very mild and nothing like a rye bread you might have purchased in the past then i noticed that they are only calories per slice what s not to love they taste good they re whole grain they re super low in calories it s no crunchier than a potato chip and i feel satisfied while chewing and after eating them oh and they keep forever in the cupboard i definitely will be buying these for a long time
positive,17/4/21,i m very pleased with this dog food haven t ordered anything else for my dogs since i bought this my lab and my malti poo both eat it happily and i m happy that it is healthy for them
positive,10/3/21,i have started buying a lot of organic food over the past year and it dawned on me that perhaps my dog should be eating more healthfully also when i look at the list of ingredients on regular dog food it is downright nauseating i bought some of this newman s own and my dog loves it she usually gobbles it up the minute i put it into the bowl
positive,10/7/21,i signed up for the monthly subscription for this item the price is great especially without having to pay shipping charges i love the fact that i can manage the subscription by skipping a month or ordering it earlier than scheduled amazon has been excellent getting my shipments out on a timely manner newman s own organics adult dog food chicken rice formula pound bag very pleased with all my orders from amazon extremely pleased with their customer service thanks amazon
positive,27/1/21,i feel better about feeding this product to my dogs i was using another popular brand but it contained a lot of fillers one of my dogs is pickier so he would prefer a meatier taste but he does clean it up eventually
positive,1/6/21,our family loves these tasty and healthy sesame honey almonds by trader joe s you get the crunchy flavor of the sesame seeds combined with the subtle sweetness of the honey and almond flavoring wow it s a great snack that you feel good while eating it is my favorite of trader joe s almond snacks almonds are good for you and a handful of these in the morning with a fruit smoothie or as a snack at lunch is a great way to get protein the healthy fat and the vitamin e that almonds offer it s a good idea to measure out cup of these almonds or count the almonds out to stay in the calorie range you want to keep within nutritionist recommend having a small amount of almonds or walnuts each day for good fat and protein
positive,20/8/21,i love these cookies i am on the paleo diet right now and these cookies are what i look forward too i do like the taste of the tropical one the best they all have different taste but if you want something that is grain free and gluten free then this is the right place i expected the taste to be different and it is other reviewers seem to expect them to taste like oreos or chips ahoy of course not when i eat them i don t even feel bad about it because my body welcomes them they don t make me crash either and feel like i ate junk food it is a good indicator that these were made from all natural ingredients i wish i had these cookies close to me i d buy them every single day
positive,14/8/21,the flavor of the fruit enclosed is outstanding bluberry and if there is a drawback it is that the blanket that encloses the fruit is a bit thick unlike this companys fig bars and pastry textured flavored with cane syrup not fruit juice cal per bar and low in fat and the carbs not too bad considering the great taste
positive,21/4/21,of the erin baker products the fruit nut mini breakfast cookie is my favorite i have one mini breakfast cookie about calories with a cup of coffee in the morning and i feel satisfied and ready to start the day very healthy low in caloreis and super delicious is what makes the product work for me try it you ll like it
positive,1/4/21,i adopted my adorable edmund last year from a shelter they sent me home with a small bag of felidae not grain free version cat and kitten dry formula as he was a kitten at the time i am very concerned about eating healthy whole foods so i of course want the best for my kitty as well i did research and found that cats digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains fruits vegetables directly and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey s stomachs ie if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it so i wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what s found in nature as possible without breaking the bank he already seemed to really like the felidae grain included version so as soon as my starter bag ran out i immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has only eaten this ever since i got him he loves it i give him one small scoop of grain free kibble in the morning and then a partial can of this large oz felidae grain free food we ve tried both the turkey chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and edmund prefers the turkey chicken but will eat anything i give him i bought some can lids at petsmart and they seal air tight on these cans so fridge storage is clean and easy he has the absolute softest shiniest fur coat i have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy we haven t had a single vet visit since i adopted him even though he had chronic upper respiratory issues when i got him they all cleared up i have to blame at least some of all this on the fact he only eats grain free felidae food the rest is because i love him so ridiculously much i love the free shipping on amazon i buy a case of canned and a bag of dry or two of one at the same time i used to buy this elsewhere and since it s so heavy shipping would often be almost as much as the product
positive,17/4/21,these are very healthy grains and very light and crispy perfect with dips or salsa tastes just like rice cake they are very easy on the teeth too for those who have dental work that they don t want to chip hard to find in supermarkets
positive,10/3/21,this product is delicious i will say this upfront thou semi messy why not place the peanut butter in the center instead on the back the taste is great so great that i started to eat them all day not good as it ruins the enjoyment these are actually so good i had to stop eating them i guess i over did it value excellent snack for everyone all my friends love them family shipping fast as always with amazon prime membership days packaging boxes total each contains individually wrapped granola thins of granola bar but flat with peanut butter on one side seriously also do not ruin the granola as i did by eating every day also i notice to avoid mess just open with scissors pealing makes a mess exclusively
positive,22/4/21,if anyone is looking for delicious and healthy snack doctor kracker is an answer however the hard crispiness is for people with good teeth
positive,1/4/21,arrowhead mills organic savory herb stuffing has a very nice blend of herbs for a flavor that compliments chicken and turkey i especially appreciate the fact that there are no transfats used in this stuffing so i and my family can enjoy it without worry the stuffing is very easy to prepare but really adds to the meal we use it all year long why wait for a holiday to enjoy good food
positive,30/6/21,soon after one dog was diagnosed with renal failure yes she ate all the foods on that recall list my westie became ill and couldn t hold any food the vet did all sorts of tests but i had to find something gentle enough for him to keep down that night i met a rep from nutro at my local petco she told me all about natural choice gave me literature and a website to learn more i purchased this canned food along with a small bag of the dry food to mix with it turns out the dog had some sort of virus but the food was the only food he could keep down to regain his strength due to skin allergies known to westies i have kept him on this food and find it s the best for him i just don t understand though how this is sold so cheap on amazon thru petco it s case in the store and on their website i think they should keep the price regulated throughout
positive,1/3/21,my dog has many food allergies but these made in the usa treats are free of wheat corn egg and dairy my dog can t get enough of them
positive,29/1/21,stars is a compromise between my rating of and my grandchildren s rating of stars i thought the flavor was too heavy on the apple grape juice combo and light on the orange tangerine flavor also it left a mild canned aftertaste but my year old granddaughters loved it and consider it a treat equal to soda it is juice concentrate which has been reconstituted with carbonated water so it is much healthier for them than regular soda while it is true it still has sugar natural sugars from the juices are healthier than processed sugars found in soft drinks the can i was sent contained ounces which is a better size for them than a regular ounce can of soda for children this is a tasty and healthy alternative
positive,17/4/21,i am a die hard soda pop fan i will drink juice but normally only certain brands or with a little soda up or sprite mixed in to kill the after taste and to sweeten it up a bit well this is better that even that mix without the bad stuff from the soda it has a crisp clean orange taste with a nice tangerine undertone that continues through the after taste it is effortless to drink and doesn t make you feel sluggish afterwords it is hard to describe other than to say they got it right no extra sugar yet it is very sweet but not too sweet i shared my can with my wife and she agreed with my comments we both we were sad that we only got the one little can to review and not the entire case while i am not sure it could replace my coke it sure could replace my juice and some of my coke intake the only problem there always seems to be something is that it is about times the cost of my coke per oz i could justify twice the cost but four times is the only reason i haven t ordered more so far i do expect to breakdown and buy a case but i still won t be happy over the cost difference
positive,10/3/21,i love everything about this drink it s got plenty of carbonation even without added sugar or artificial sweeteners it s plenty sweet without being too sweet i love tangerine and this has a very tangerine y flavor and aroma if you love oranges or tangerines this is the perfect drink for you i ordered this from the vine program out of curiosity but it will be one of my must buy items in the future i m also going to buy some for my grandchildren since it has no added sugars and i know they ll love it it will be perfect for them
positive,30/5/21,i quit sodas over a year ago due to the unhealthiness of them i do however like bubbly drinks but i don t need the sugar or sodium that s why this product is perfect it is fruit juice carbonated for the bubbliness orange is one of my favorite flavors this drink is the perfect drink i think this product is even better than orange soda orange soda is sticky but this product is not it has the perfect amount of sharpness which i love because it is fruit juice it also has the perfect amount of natural sweetness so this product is all the good things rolled into one fruit juice no added sugar bubbly awesome orange flavor it s so good it s hard to believe you re drinking something healthy
positive,6/5/21,i was really surprised at the taste of the switch orange tangerine drink it reminds me of carbonated orange juice it is a little on the sweet side but not too bad in my opinion this is actually a beverage that i could drink all the time and not get tired of the best thing about switch is that it is healthy for you and it doesn t have any added sugars and it has a lot of vitamin c switch is a all natural beverage which is great you can have the carbonation of a soda without all the unhealthy unnatural ingredients of a soda if you want a great tasting drink that is healthy for you then i highly recommend switch if you like orange juice then i think you ll really enjoy this the cans are a little on the smaller side though
positive,20/4/21,my teens and their friends drink regular soda pop by the gallon they re obviously addicted to the stuff a very unhealthy habit i can t drink soda pop myself it s been years or so since i had one and so i began searching for a drink that tasted like regular soda pop but wasn t unhealthy i searched high and low for a suitable alternative and then i found izze i love the fruity tangy flavor of izze s sparkling grafefruit soda the grapefruit flavor goes well with spicy mexican foods but it is also great just by itself my teens love izze and drink it now just like soda pop i m so happy to know they aren t guzzling down corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors but instead are enjoying all natural izze with no added sweeetners if you re looking for a great alternative to regular soda pop you can t do better than to buy izze
positive,20/4/21,sticks and twigs may seem a little pricey compared to regular pretzels but the bag lasts a long time and the ingredients like flax seeds quinoa chia seeds and curry are good for you they are very crunchy but tasty for some added protein i like to dip them in peanut butter
positive,21/4/21,usually healthy food is hard to swallow not these fresh crunchy delicious pumpkin seeds i switched from potato chips and my wife tells me they are good for the prostate what do i know i m taking her word for it
positive,2/5/21,i had never tried bob s red mill pumpkin seeds although i have used and been very happy with many of their other products i was looking for pumpkin seeds from pumpkins grown in the usa most of the organic seeds are from china the bob s red mill seeds are from pumpkins grown in oregon i took the plunge and ordered bags of these seeds and they arrived in less than hours four sealed bags were also in a sealed bob s red mill box and then packaged in a larger amazon box i just opened one bag of the seeds to try them they are way better than what i was getting at my local whole food store in bulk these seeds are chewy as they should be and not hard or stale with any off taste these have a slight pumpkin taste which they should have this variety of seed is rounder and flatter than some of the other pumpkin seed varieties i ve had which i like no pointy ends to stab me as i m munching them down all in all a great buy seeds stars grown in the usa stars total stars
positive,7/9/21,i was very satisfied with my purchase of nutiva hemp seeds i ordered a pack of them and it arrived fairly quickly they taste great on their own but i usually add them to protein shakes to enhance the amino acid profile or sprinkle them on top of salads for added flavor and texture my supply is almost gone so i ll definitely be ordering more one of the reviews said there were still shells in the bag but i didn t find any in mine
positive,25/5/21,i used the hemp seeds every morning with my protein shake the taste is great and they are so healthy
positive,22/5/21,when i was told by my nutritionist that eating a handful of whole natural almonds a day would help me to lose weight and get the right kind of fats and proteins implemented into my diet i was a bit skeptical i was not a huge almond fan to begin with i don t particularly enjoy salted or roasted almonds usually only the kind that come surrounded with coconut and chocolate or the kind that you get out of the nut bowl to she will around the holidays the whole natural almonds by blue diamond taste like they came right out of the she will and boy are they yummy i like that they are a satisfying snack and i like the taste of them these are the ones i buy no added salt or anything nice and fresh right out of the she will stars
positive,19/7/21,if you want a truly healthy filling snack you must give these a try as well as their sisters the vanilla bean almonds they are both just lightly sweetened and fragrant with either the cinnamon or the vanilla depending on which you choose the container is marvelous there is a half flip top which is easy to do with one hand like in the car and they re not roasted in more oil so the almonds are meaty and sweet and almonds are sooo good for you i d recommend that you try them and then get an amazon subscribe and save if you can it s well worth it and all natural lovely
positive,7/9/21,i wouldn t call these almonds sweet but they do have just the right hint of sweet flavor that the almond is elevated and feels like a treat the taste and texture of almonds doesn t particularly appeal to me but they re such a healthy snack that i m glad to find this delicious option also the small container is the perfect size to have on your desk or keep in the car or use as stocking stuffers like i plan to do for a couple of my healthy eating conscious friends
positive,25/8/21,the almonds tastes all right since it is too dry the salt can hardly stay on surface therefore it is not salty enough on the whole it is a healthy snack i hope this type of almonds can have subscription service and discount
positive,6/9/21,these almonds taste good not as well flavored as the cinnamon or vanilla flavored but a decent change of pace a little plain though
positive,25/5/21,my review is for the cinnamon cookie in the small bag i love them i do not have gluten issues but i like the fact that the cookies are gluten free they are crunchy and satisfy my desire for something sweet only caloriesand g of fat in three cookies each pack has cookies g of saturated fat trans fat cholesterol mg sodium g fiber g of carbs and g of protein yummy every bite starbucks carries them sporadically and i am so glad to be able to buy them from amazon
positive,7/9/21,i love almonds in general and this particular brand is quite good they taste great with just the right amount of salt and oil for me anyway they re individually packaged in oz cans which makes them an easy and portable snack portion control is also easier with the small can size i ve ordered a few packs of these almonds and while there is some slight variation in the taste from batch to batch some are roasted a bit darker than others i have always found them fresh and tasty almonds are relatively healthy too high in protein a good source of magnesium calcium and manganese and full of unsaturated fats i haven t seen organic roasted salted almonds from this company but i hope they offer them eventually at a decent price one thing i would also like to see is some kind of assurance that the can liner is free of bpa
positive,13/10/21,i was a skeptic about this product until i tried it with skim milk this cereal is delicious and retains its crunch even after minutes of being soaked in milk i enjoy its texture and caramelly flavor i think it could definitely be less sweet and lower carb but so far i find this cereal to have the highest fiber content the other vitamins and minerals a single serving contains is also comparable to similar products by other companies this is perfect for breakfast or a snack any time of the day
positive,2/10/21,we were pleased with this salt it s actually more salty than regular salt even kosher salt or sea salt a little bit goes a long way i don t usually cook with it but add it to things afterwards i ve been hand grinding it
positive,23/9/21,right now i own cats that i found outside a good eight years ago and i found another cat which i adopted also i have always fed them eukanuba adult lamb rice dry cat food and they truly love it when you first open the bag you can smell the savory aroma of the cats that i found outdoor and adopted one turned out to be a turkish angora and the other has markings similar to that of a snow leopard and the third cat i found out is part egyptian mau i also feed a feral cat who has been living in my back yard for years they all love this food and even when they changed the formula of this food a few years ago they still eat it and love it if you read the ingredients it is excellently made and a real plus for their diet they ve been eating it for years now and i have yet to see any of my cats turn up their nose to this food the other dry foods that my cats love is fancy feast gourmet filet mignon flavor with real seafood shrimp dry cat food and they ve just started eating eagle pack natural pet food indoor formula for cats and a cat food brand called artemis i haven t any problems with them eating any of these dry foods and i ve been rescuing cats for over years now and have owned as many as cats at one time one set of kittens were born outdoor and i brought them indoors with their mother and kept them all until the day they passed on they all lived to be close to years of age and they too ate eukanuba lamb rice and loved it i have had foods that they turned up their nose with like chicken soup and taste of the wild the same way we humans have our likes and dislikes is the same way that these cats have their likes and dislikes what s good for one cat might not be good for another you just have to learn your cat and see what they like and just give it to them while my cats are in love with eukanuba lamb rice maybe your cat will also or maybe not but it isn t fair to not try this food because of a review where the owner says that their cat doesn t like it as previously stated maybe your cat will not like it or maybe your cat will love it i ve tried cat foods based on good reviews figuring that the food will automatically be a hit and sometimes it was and sometimes it wasn t it s all up to the cat
positive,26/6/21,when pet promise a safe and healthy pet food went out of business i was desperately looking for another healthy food that had no by products rendered fats meat meals or outsourced ingredients you might want to check out what these types of ingredients can include if your stomach can take it but avoid commercial manufacturers spins on this good books to get in this regard are foods pets die for and protect your pet food pets die for shocking facts about pet food protect your pet more shocking facts my cats were completely unaffected by the melamine contamination tragedy of which killed many pets especially cats because their pet promise food was one of the few brands in america that didn t use outsourced ingredients and was never on the recall list unlike some of the very expensive premium brands i felt so lucky that i had already switched to pet promise a petfood company that bought ingredients only from north american farmers using sustainable agriculture and free range livestock i finally discovered halo s products and was encouraged by the fact that ellen degeneres a devout animal lover herself not only endorses it but also has become part owner of the company their website also included a specific message written to us former pet promise users so i went to my health food store and bought some i was delighted to see that it had no by products no rendered meats no meat meals and that the label stated that all its ingredients are made in the usa except the pea protein from canada furthermore the salmon in halo is wild alaskan not farmed salmon aka pharmed salmon full of antibiotics etc moreover it is low in carbohydrates and even includes probiotics in the mix making it even more promising than pet promise but the ultimate test was whether my cats would eat it or not unlike my dachshunds who would eat just about anything that hit the floor they re really low to the ground you know cats are notorious for their persnickety eating habits but they love it can t get enough so i have to dole it out so they don t overeat and after five months their health and energy seem to be great oh and hi ellen and many thanks
positive,25/5/21,ironically i am an amazon seasonal worker i discovered these tasty treats while working on the sales floor i kept thinking wow i sure ship alot of these things what are they so i went home and checked them out on line for myself i am a very active and healthy person i am always looking for wholesome breakfast options i have a hard time eating in the am these cookies are so filling and delish i eat one at around am and i am fine until lunch healthy ingredients to fuel your busy day lifestyle i can t wait to put them in my back pack when i go hiking next
positive,7/9/21,slightly biased because this company was started near my hometown but i ve been a fan of erin baker s breakfast cookies for years since i first noticed them popping up at coffee shops back home now living on the other side of the country i was pleasantly surprised to find them on amazon and even more excited to find them at such a great price store them in the freezer pop them in the toaster and it s like eating a fresh baked cookie that is full of good things for you and keeps you from getting hungry till lunch high in fiber and much better tasting than any energy bar out there who doesn t love a cookie for breakfast i love these things will be ordering more soon to keep our freezer well stocked
positive,15/7/21,my dog loves these and everyone i have shared with agrees it s a great snack why feed grains and dog bones when you can offer a high protein healthy snack that promotes good health
positive,27/9/21,after trying a number of other chocolate chip cookie mixes my husband and i were beginning to wonder if any gluten wheat and dairy free cookies could taste better than sawdust pamela s chocolate chunk cookie mix was a revelation tastes as good as regular chocolate chip cookies delicious
positive,19/6/21,these whenever bars taste like soft chocolate chip cookies the coconut flavor is very good and natural tasting don t be deceived by the size of the package the wrapper is much larger than the bar still it is a satisfying snack and comes in at a respectable calories i eat them around mid morning or as a late night snack i do not avoid gluten wheat or dairy these bars are wheat free gluten free and non dairy but do enjoy organic foods and was pleased to see healthy ingredients including oats agave chia seeds brown rice flour etc once these become available in the subscribe and save program i feel certain i will subscribe they are great to have around for a low calorie sweet treat
positive,25/5/21,these are even tastier than the original flavor works great in belgian waffle maker too why are they not priced right and available by subscription
positive,7/9/21,finding great tasting steel oats that cook as quickly as processed oatmeal is not easy to do these oats can even be microwaved and never get gummy i originally found these in california while visiting family and could not find them in virginia when i returned home you have to purchase two big bags minimum when getting them from the internet and they are big bags but i intend to share one with friends
positive,3/8/21,my husband and i have been making a serious effort to change our eating habits and be healthy which is why i purchased this product i was concerned about the highly processed vegetable oil we had been using and the way the oil can become carcinogenic when cooked at high heat now this is true for any oil it should not be heated past it s smoke point avocado oil has a very high smoke point making it a perfect healthy choice it has healthy fats for your heart and tastes yummy i also recommend macadamia oil for the same reasons amazon shipped these right away and they were perfect if you have a misto this is a great oil to put in it we will definitely keep this on hand
positive,5/9/21,i have a senentary job and like to munch on things after steadily gaining weight i decided that what i was munching on wasn t doing me any favors enter dried and bake dried fruit there is no guilt if i polish off an entire bag in one sitting although i do try to refrain from doing so the bare fruit brand is great because these are baked dried they are crunchy like chips and the only ingredients are apples and cinnamon because of the shrinkage you can eat more than you mean to but it is far better than eating anything artificial amazon s price is very competitive i originally bought these from marshall s and tj maxx for two dollars twenty nine cents
positive,25/5/21,this is part of my regular order now i love it i used it when i did the master cleanse and it was perfect
positive,7/9/21,my month daughter loves these she s been eating them since around mos old because of the bag is a full fruit and veggie serving i sometimes give them to her along with her main dish at lunch time they re also great for snack time and it s good to know that they are healthy and count towards her daily fruit veggie servings when fresh fruit and veggies are not readily available i also love that both flavors of these fruit veggie melts are a completely mess free snack which is always a plus
positive,11/9/21,somersaults are a terrific snack addictive really healthier than most snacks and very convenient packaging be warned you will want more
positive,13/7/21,this is an outstandingly good cereal it is not too sweet is delicious and healthy too a nice choice for anyone wanting to live a healthy life
positive,22/7/21,i could not find these in a store so i ordered them through amazon if you want a healthy snack with just enough chocolate to kill the craving this is it
positive,22/6/21,i have started eating almonds as a healthy alternative to fatty or high carb snacks but wanted something to satisfy my sweet tooth on occasion these cocoa roast almonds fit the bill nicely they just have a dusting of cocoa so there s no more fat or unhealthy stuff than you would find in regular almonds but you still get a nice chocolate taste they are just a little bit sweeter than i really want i like dark chocolate semisweet or bittersweet but still a great once in awhile snack
positive,28/7/21,these have a lot less sugar than other brands but still a lot of chocolate flavor i d eat plain almonds every now and then but they left my mouth dry these are addictive and i eat them every day they make a great healthy snack
positive,13/10/21,best dark chocolate ever i wish it was stocked well at amazon
positive,19/2/21,i found this snack to be tasty healthy and satisfying when i microwaved it it was delicious also very convenient for snacking on go
positive,14/12/20,i am a fan of kashi it seems that everything they make is not only quite healthy but also very tasty my father can t stand the health food that i buy but he had one of these and actually liked it i will convert him yet
positive,14/12/20,this bar was given out to serious mountain bikers during a recent race and i had a chance to sample one i found it delicious and because of it s raw live essence food content it is also a healthy snack alternative that is easy to carry with you i always have one in my lunch bag or carry one with me when i m out shopping all day it does have a slight oily feel but i don t find it objectionable i highly recommend it
positive,19/2/21,if your daily water consumption is not at least l for women l for men a day then it really doesn t matter what kind of water you drink work on getting your consumption up to the minimum if you are drinking upwards of a gallon of water a day then picking a water of atrisian type is greatly worth the health benefits also plastic is quite detrimental to your health so getting an item like voss in the glass bottles instead of plastic is worth the price tag otherwise just buy glass bottle of voss and reuse the bottle if you feel the need to impress your friends trust me no one drinks voss to impress anyone people who do are morons and everyone around them already knows it
positive,10/1/21,pros no added sugar g per tbsp serving no added salt mg per serving great taste organic no stirring needed cons expensive even for sunflower butter we paid per jar here at amazon with free shipping thin consistency closer to a pourable topping than a butter a bit higher in calories than many nut seed butters cal per serving this makes a nice optional butter for anyone with allergies facility is peanut and tree nut free or someone just looking for variety it is a bit messy to use because of how thin it is on the plus side though i m sure i use less than a serving on my sandwich to avoid having it drip or squirt out which keeps calories lower it remains thin when refrigerated which the package recommends after opening to maintain freshness we eat a reduced sodium and low sugar diet and did find that we could tell that this was made without either it is definitely less sweet than a no added sugar peanut butter since we usually make our sandwiches with either a banana or strawberries we didn t mind the missing sweetness but someone used to a more traditional butter product may amazon shipping on this product was fast and without any problems usps
positive,26/3/21,i use sunbutter as part of a program to lower blood pressure and it works but i d eat sunbutter anyway simply for the taste of it if you love sunflower seeds this is a product for you many people need the nutrients of sunflower seeds but can t digest seeds folks with crohn s disease ulcerative colitis diverticulitis for example they can however enjoy the taste and nutrients of sunflower seeds with this product i but this in multiples because so many friends and family members become hooked after trying a jar at my house it tastes best in my humble opinion on toast it is richer in healthy oils than other spreadable products but i stir it up as soon as i open a jar then refrigerate it the oil doesn t separate again although i do give it a quick stir with a knife before spreading it on toast highly recommended
positive,24/3/21,i add boneless chicken breast peppers onions and string beans and simmer until the chicken is done i ate this dish over cup of brown rice for dinner for months straight when dieting losing a total of lbs i did not get sick of this dish as it is so tasty the calorie and contents of this dish fit the specs of the diet that i was on delicious way to lose weight
positive,24/2/21,this item is a healthy and inexpensive treat for the whole family easily enjoyed while driving watching tv or almost anything with no salt it s great for restricted sodium diets
positive,19/2/21,these cereal bars are great the ones with strawberry and blueberry are the best they are chewy but still soft
positive,14/12/20,i ve ordered this cereal twice so far from amazon i can find it at our local health market but it costs more locally than buying a three pack from amazon the best by dates are always good this last pack had months from purchase my family really enjoys the taste though it doesn t taste like kelloggs raisin bran peace one cup serving has calories g fat mg sodium g total carbs g dietary fiber g sugar g protein kellogs one cup has same calories g fat mg sodium g total carbs g dietary fiber g sugar g protein this may not be for everyone but i love a raisin bran cereal and knowing peace has half the sugar makes me love it even more
positive,19/10/21,i just ordered boxes of solbites to give to my customers at fiat of montgomeryville within a week the supply was depleted great packaging great taste great addition to the cluttered assortment of snacks solbites gets five stars from fiat of montgomeryville look for our next order
positive,18/5/21,these bars are great for a snack they have alot of healthy ingredients and low sugar the bars have a good flavor from the coconut it is hard to find bars that don t have soy ingredients as well
positive,19/2/21,have been using riceselect royal blend for years as the healthier tastier alternative to plain brown rice and plain white rice after my local supermarket stopped carrying it i was delighted to find it on amazon com at a lower price than in the supermarket
positive,14/12/20,if you want a healthy treat and one that is very satisfying try the lara bars an important plus is that is soy free which is important to a lot of people these days
positive,1/6/21,i buy these for the whole family coconut cream pie is our favorite flavor we also like the chocolate varieties and key lime pie my yo and yo sons think these are a real treat since they are so sweet i love the simple natural ingredients too they are a little pricey but healthier foods usually are
positive,1/4/21,we really enjoyed this product containes no sugar contains dates and such and it s healthy while giving you the chocolate fix you need
positive,15/4/21,quitting sugar is hard nana s cookies make it much easier i get to enjoy the sweet chocolately taste i crave without the sugar or chemicals in most other cookies they are delicious and very satisfying because they are sweetened with fruit juice my blood sugar does not get spiked so i do not get a high followed by a crash after eating these cookies nor do i feel addicted to them like i do when i eat products made with sugar and i like that they are gluten free since we are bombarded by products made from wheat and i crave a variety of grains like oats and rice i highly recommend these cookies i eat them regularly and they fulfill my craving for sweets which has been so helpful in making better food choices when i am faced with temptation and on amazon they are priced very reasonably and worth every penny
positive,19/5/21,my dog has numerous food allergies so finding a treat that passes the allergy test and one that he likes can be difficult add to this the fact that he is definitely not motivated by food and rewarding him with treats can be challenging my four footed wonder absolutely loves the get naked gut health dental chew sticks and if he could he d give them five stars himself
positive,19/2/21,after suffering from flu like symptoms for a week i tried this tea with honey and it was not only delicious but after using for a day i feel so much better
positive,14/12/20,i am very careful these days what i eat due to a recent diagnosis one of the things i watch is message read some reports on it and you ll understand why everything in my cupboard had message in it this does not the risk is always will it taste good message adds a lot of salt and what the brain reads as flavor and sometimes removing it can seem like a reduction in flavor not so with this product it is so good i use it wherever and whenever i can i am finding that i do not have to use very much so it goes quite far i now have the vege beef and onion flavored versions and they are all good mmmmmmm happy tummy
positive,28/7/21,i bought these almonds because amazon had a good sale going on i really liked them i usually buy a couple of pounds of unroasted unsalted almonds a week at the local grocery store sold by a well known national brand these back to nature almonds were far superior they were fresher i also like the pack that could be resealed they came in convenient packs so that you don t have to have a huge bag open while you try to finish it if you use almonds you will enjoy these
positive,29/6/21,great organic dog food from a company i trust my dog eats it happily and heartily with the automatic delivery option the pricing is the cheapest i have been able to find both on line and in the stores definitely recommend
positive,15/10/21,i prefer to stick with organic versions of the dirty dozen in produce which sadly includes most berries but i also try to follow my pediatrician s advice to have my son eat the rainbow each day that gets tough especially when we get into fall winter when fresh fruits and veggies are fewer and far between organic berries like the strawberries and raspberries in this product are expensive hard to find and definitely out of season right now here in ny enter ella s red one smoothie fruits these pouches are great to have around as an option to round out my toddler s colorful fruit intake for the day not to mention they re delicious think applesauce with sweet berries added for extra flavor and flair and they re ideal when we re on the go with a few of these tossed into my diaper bag i always have something healthy and organic on hand for him to enjoy they re even a nice snack for me when i find myself a bit low on energy when we re out and about the crushed fruit inside these pouches is smooth almost baby food consistency so it slurps up through the straw like top easily once i ve unscrewed the cap my month old can eat this entirely without my help leaving my hands free to get stuff done sweet
positive,20/7/21,this bar is the perfect snack for late afternoon or whenever you feel lethargic or hungry especially when you know you are eating something good for your body i guess they are a bit expensive but for a product that has added antioxidants and is gluten free i guess that s about right at least amazon offers a great discount
positive,12/10/21,great product no fat all natural nothing added great crunch and taste favorite company by far
positive,19/2/21,i don t like cinnamon and i don t like apples so i was surprised when a friend offered me bare fruit organic bake dried cinnamon apple chips ounce bags pack of and i liked it i figured i d like it even more without cinnamon so i found these on amazon and oh my they are amazing i have eaten one full pound and have not experienced any bad chips like the one reviewer who said they were musty my roommate ate the other pound and said one chip was incredibly sour but all the others were great the only reason i took off a star is because the packaging did not include nutrition information it was easy enough to find on livestrong but i definitely think it should be included because the chips are all different sizes they don t give an easy to visualize amount say cup this many calories you really need a foods scale to know how much you re eating but in case its of any use to anyone grams of chips is calories g is carbs and g fiber i gave some to my dad to try he grows about different varieties of fruit trees including apples he said he s dried apples before and they taste the same as these he takes care not to use anything non organic or unhealthy so its good they taste the same also for some reason they store better in the shiny bag they ship in i divided one bag into ziplocs to be able to grab for snacks and they got sort of soft whereas the chips kept in the original bag inside a ziplock stayed crispy and fresh
positive,14/12/20,i just got these in the mail today and can t stop eating them no fat no added sugar just pure crunchy apple slices they are wonderful

positive,12/1/20,i take a spoonful of coconut manna every day this is a blend of coconut oil and the coconut meat and it tastes sweet and yummy very good antifungal and a healthy oil for heart brain hair joints i use regular coconut oil for cooking some people complain about it separating which is true but i use a fork and rake it from the glass to the middle then it is easy to take a spoonful you could gently heat it in a pot of hot water and then mix it up but i never heat it i prefer the glass jar to the newer plastic they are using but i am happy it is organic
positive,19/2/20,these are absolutely delicious and healthier than other cookies since made with wheat flour rice syrup and cane juice rather than white flour and sugar my kids love them and enjoy them as a snack with a glass of milk

positive,26/9/20,these are great snacks for my kids and my teenagers even like them better for them than high preservative and or high calorie snacks and they give them some good carbs and protein
positive,22/7/19,these almond butter balls are a unique and delicious snack chock full of almond bits all over the exterior of the ball these provide a nice dose of fiber protein and healthy monounsaturated fats which other snacks often lack unlike other betty lou s balls this flavor does not contain whey dairy protein so it is suitable for vegans or dairy allergy sufferers also just as a tip these are very soft so i always smush thumb knead out the ball until it is a flat square taking up the entire area of the plastic packaging they re much more satisfying to eat pick at and last longer that way a great option when you re sick of bars i only wish they were organic hence the missing star and that betty lou s made more dairy free balls
positive,2/2/20,my kids absolutely love these they appeal to all my kids from my year old to my year old we will be on automatic reorder from now on
positive,23/5/20,i received my box of pure natural bars right before going on a long road trip i took several of the bars with me hoping that they would satisfy my hunger pangs while i traveled i am pleased to report that these little snack bars did a great job of keeping my tummy happy and i didn t feel like i was eating something packed with preservatives or artificial ingredients the mixture of fruits and nuts provides a sweet and nutty flavor experience that is a nice change from other bland or over sweetened snack bars pros natural ingredients pleasant texture great taste cons wrapper is a little difficult to remove due to bars being slightly sticky overall i recommend these snack bars for anyone who wants a convenient snack on the go without feeling guilty about artificial ingredients
positive,22/11/20,i was pleased with the ingredients in these bars i thought that there could have been a slightly bolder fruit flavor the peanuts were plentiful and that was a plus for me overall i would rate them a good buy and would definitely consider purchasing them
positive,30/3/20,it s a tub of mixed nuts i ll spare you a long winded review on them i ve tried the mixed nuts they sell locally which have a lot of peanuts mixed in and the difference in quality is pretty noticeable these are much firmer fresher and just taste overall better it seems the filler nut they used here were almonds which is fine and certainly better then peanuts but it s unfortunate that pecans are scarce brazil nuts are pretty generously packed in as well with moderate amounts of hazelnut filbert and cashew you get a lot of salt near the bottom naturally but otherwise there s just enough mixed in to assure that they stay flavorful from the moment you open them i would recommend these to anyone looking for a mixed nut snack much better than the rest i ve tried so far
positive,8/7/20,started eating turkey jerky lately because its a healthy snack and that s when i came across snackmasters i have tried the beef ahi tuna and salmon all taste great

positive,2/11/20,i use this more often than olive oil i use olive oil for salad dressings and an occasional stir fry and this for most all other frying it has a light coconut flavor that took my year old son some time to get used to but he doesn t notice anymore i see people buying this in capsules as a supplement

positive,2/2/20,i picked sahale cashews with pomegranate at a starbuck s after coming from the gym they are so tasty not too sweet but sweet enough i was delighted to be able to order them on amazon they are a bit pricey but come out cheaper when you buy them in bulk vs buying single packets in local stores i will buy them again
positive,4/10/20,like many other reviewers i first found these apple chips at costco who has since discontinued them if i d known they were going to be discontinued i would have stocked up because they were about cheaper but still the amazon price is a good deal for such a large quantity of dried apples i eat them as a snack i keep a bag at the office for this purpose and i also use them as treats for my pet bunny he goes absolutely bonkers for them the quality is great i haven t found a single seed or inedible piece in the four bags i ve gone through so far plus they are organic which i do not normally care about but becomes important if you are ingesting any quantity of peels definitely recommend
positive,1/4/20,these apple chips are delicious and healthy for you they are the perfect snack especially if you are on a gluten free diet i highly recommend them they are a perfect alternative to potato chips
positive,8/5/20,i love eating these apple chips i tried good health original apple crisps these are the ones in the fuji apple salad sold at panera bread and while yummy they are fried and have more calories this particular variety by bare fruit is baked and has less than cal serving so i consider this a win win

positive,5/2/20,this is a great product even though i am a health nut the acai powder taste really good with my protein shake plus it has a high potency i will mix this powder with a chocolate protein shake and both taste and color changes which shows it s the real deal even though it is a antioxidant product you have to eat right as well to feel the effect follow the instructions really carefully put in the refrigerator after first use or else it will spoil
positive,22/7/19,i have been purchasing this item directly at target once a week for the past four months and have been very satisfied with each purchase the nuts taste fresh they are crunchy and a good variety no peanuts i made the transition from slated nuts to these without any trouble because they are so good a great product that you will feel good about eating

positive,1/3/20,i switched my dogs to this food and i have noticed many improvements in there overall health they have shinny healthy coats of fur more energy and more regular and solid bowel movements i care about my dog s health and this product delivers good healthy ingredients and my dogs really love it
positive,23/11/20,tastes amazing good for you small or so calories you can eat this on the go or at home for a morning snack or at work in between meals perfect in every way and organic the only con i have is the price it s almost dollars a bar which is kind of high for buying in bulk it is a small bar after all the organic protein bars i usually use contain almost twice the calories are still raw and organic though not as good tasting as this strawberry bar comes in at about the same price it can be used as a meal replacement which makes it worth the value if amazon could offer this as a subscribe and save option and get the price down to dollars i would highly recommend this and subscribe to get new ones delivered to my house twice a month these things are amazing
positive,5/4/21,for the past years my husband has been experimenting with making whole grain pancakes he is constantly trying new whole grain pancake mixes out on the family we were visiting some friends in brooklyn when he discovered the kodiak cakes at a small deli he bought the box and made them for us and we couldn t believe how amazing these whole grain pancakes are they are super tasty and made with amazing ingredients hands down the best whole grain pancake mix i have ever had we bought boxes to start giving away as gifts when we go to someone s house instead of giving a bottle of wine
positive,27/4/20,i boil rice and quinoa together after rinsing will add about cup of go raw freeland live sprouted seeds to it the seeds naturally add flavor and a slight crunch to the rice and quinoa nothing else needs to be added all of the flavors mix together to provide a healthy and tasty meal
positive,8/3/21,sometimes i see myself going for unhealthy snacks from vending machines now i take this with me everywhere i go it s perfect for quick snack healthy perfect portion delicious
positive,30/1/20,i switched to celtic sea salt for added minerals and also because the body can process it better than table salt the taste is unbelieveable it highlights every flavor of your food i am so impressed i refuse to go back to table salt for any reason it is damp due to being taken directly from a sea bed althoug i did not get the grinder the company offers instead i got one at target it works ok i do have to shake the grinder sometimes to get it to work freely with the damp salt overall i am extermely impressed with this salt
positive,22/7/19,my dogs love these sweet potato treats i feed my dogs grain free diets and other high end supplements so of course i wanted a treat that followed our feeding ethic this is low in protein and fat so it is gentle on the stomach of puppies and sick dogs alike my dogs go crazy over these they love the taste and since these are a little tough it takes them a bit longer to finish them which is great because dogs usually swallow treats whole they are not extremely tough though puppies can eat them even though the bag does not have an indication to refrigerate after opening please do so they will last longer and remain fresher plus you could prevent mold growth amazon sells these by far at the most affordable price specialty stores sell these treats up to twice as much as amazon does so i suggest you buy them from amazon if you want a healthy treat this is the way to go
positive,2/2/20,you know how limited your food choices can be when your plane is delayed and the airport is pretty much closing down for the night well that s how i found mrs mays cran blueberry crunch the candy and gum kiosk at laguardia carries them and i was not going to make it tbrough a hour delay on a snickers the cran blueberry crunch was wonderful hit the spot and carried through with no sugar crash they re delicious without being overly sweet and the fruit is real fruit not dried fruit with yucky preservatives when i got hom i couldn t find it locally so i ordered a case from amazon and i keep a bag in my desk drawer for that late afternoon snack attack i ve shared with my friends and everyone loves it enjoy
positive,2/9/20,kind makes a range of great products with minimal additives and fresh bright flavors these clusters are nice and crunchy and great for any granola type use the clusters are not very big so this product is better for me as a yogurt topper or breakfast cereal than snacking the blueberry vanilla flavor was a bit muted but i m happy to compromise on that for such a hearty healthy product
positive,26/1/21,i ve tried a number of different granola cereals over the years including the kind healthy grains vanilla blueberry clusters with flax seeds and kind healthy grains ranks among the best for taste i d call this moderately sweet which is just fine with me but it might make this less of a hit with people with more of a sweet tooth especially kids of course you can always add sugar fruit or some other sweetener if you think it needs it as the nutrition facts on the package reveal this is a fairly healthy breakfast option there s little fat in a cup serving g total fat none of which is saturated or trans fat with no cholesterol there are g carbs of which only g are from sugar there are also g fiber mg sodium and a serving has calories
positive,9/1/21,i think we have a winner here the packaging promises that the product is all natural and only contains things you can pronounce it does too flavor was very nice and not too sweet this product contains flax which i don t particularly care for but the flax wasn t noticeable this does have a decent amount of sesame seeds in it while i don t mind the taste of sesame seeds they did tend to get stuck in my teeth i ate this both dry and as a cereal with milk it was great both ways to me the real test for any food is will my kids eat it in this case the answer is a resounding yes additionally i brought this along to munch on at a swim meet and the kids on the team wanted a taste they all liked it too
positive,30/7/21,this is an extremely tasty seaweed snack the biggest plus to this product however is the fact that it is roasted with olive oil most commercial seaweed snacks are roasted in rancid unhealthy canola oil or soybean oil so the only option for health conscious people was to buy the raw nori sheets and roast them ourselves which is fine but a bit of a pain kudos to seasnax for stepping in and filling the void the only downside is they are a bit pricey but that sometimes happens when a company is first to market with a compelling product hopefully others will get in on the act and competition will drive the price a bit also there is no real amazon discount vs buying at whole foods but not everybody lives near a wf and not all wf s stock this product
positive,30/10/20,i love that my son is learning to feed himself with these healthy snacks that he loves
positive,3/8/20,love this stuff since reading that olive oil is best just used for cold not cooked items i use it for cooking as well as a condiment on sandwiches a spread on whole grain breads and even added to protein shakes it is soooo healthy anyone reading up on it should make sure they are reading current info not old no longer valid statements i even use it on my face i ordered a jar to see if i liked it which i do and have since gone on amazon s auto ship program couldn t be more convenient good price savings too

positive,19/10/21,i m happy to have found a drink flavor mix that uses the healthier option of stevia tastes pretty good i use it with a fiber mix so it s just fine fiber drinks like metamucil typically have the less healthy sweeteners so i just buy konsyl and mix it with the stevita

positive,15/6/21,when we lived in louisville we had a fresh market close to us we used to buy crispy green dried fruit there we now live in a state that doesn t have any fresh markets anywhere and haven t been able to find this product in any other store so we always order these off of amazon they re very good for toddlers learning how to chew table food also a healthy snack for everyone and those with an allergy to sulfur such as myself which is found in other dried fruit this is a good option

positive,15/2/20,a dog trainer suggested we switch to grain free dog food for our two dogs the young jack russell mix not picky at all but the elderly shih tzu will sometimes refuse to eat the trainer also suggested we steam the dry food with boiling water so the dogs especially the shih tzu could smell it we ve been using this brand for some time now and both dogs love it steaming it produces a bit of a gravy it also softens the food which is helpful for the shih tzu we ve tried different types and flavors of dog food in the past but this one is still a huge hit with the dogs they also seem quite healthy and active on it

positive,11/9/21,rye oats wheat rice and barley are not part of a dogs evolutionaly history so why feed unnatural foods dogs are carnivors green cow is a good value and will extend your pets healthy life i started feeding green cow to my year old golden months ago this is my th golden and number will get tripe from the start also it should be noted that she gets minutes of hard exercise daily do not let age slow your pet down if you have an older large dog with hind leg and back arthritis you may want to try pyhcox i double the recommended dose my observation is these products have decreased my pets pain and stiffness increased her muscle mass and improved her daily life
positive,20/9/21,since reading some horrid stories about how some pet foods are made when meat by products are listed among the ingredients it is usually from questionable sources gross at best dangerous for the pet at worst i have decided to look for a healthier option i found merrick cat food by chance and was impressed by the list of the ingredients they use here are the ingredients for the flavor grammy s pot pie my cat s favorite chicken chicken broth turkey liver fresh red jacket new potatoes fresh carrots fresh snow peas fresh whole red delicious apples potato starch modified olive oil calcium carbonate potassium chloride tricalcium phosphate cassia gum carrageenan flax seed oil for omega poultry seasoning thyme sage rosemary choline chloride salt taurine mixed tocopherols vitamin e supplement yucca schidigera extract zinc amino acid complex iron amino acid complex manganese amino acid complex vitamin b supplement copper amino acid complex d calcium pantothenate vitamin a acetate niacin lecithin vitamin d supplement riboflavin supplement folic acid ethylenediamine dihydriodide cobalt glucoheptanate pyridoxine hydrochloride biotin thiamine mononitrate sodium selenite if you pay attention to the first ingredients you will see that there are no meat by products or grains a cheap filler used by many companies that produce dog and cat food my cat really likes this food it comes in many other flavors and she seems to enjoy pretty much all the ones i have offered her what also makes me like this food is that it does smell a lot better that any supermarket pet food the meat flavors smell like meat and the fish ones smell like fish but in a disturbing pungent way also you can see small pieces of vegetables with the meat which my cat also likes and that are good for her sure this food is a little more expensive than other products but all in all it s well worth it a must have your cat will thank you

positive,11/6/21,this company makes all their food with the highest natural ingredients but this limited ingredients one is the best i learned that cats cannot digest carbohydrates so many cats have stomach problems and sensitive stomachs like my kitty i switched my cat over to this food and his stools are firmer and less smelly and he never throws up my cat gobbled up the food right away i highly recommend this
positive,2/8/21,wow i actually picture the peanut butter cookie fresh out of the oven as this hits my tastebuds i was just looking for a gluten free meal replacement bar lucky me i found a delicious meal alternative that keeps me full for hours
positive,18/10/21,this is the only type of treat my cat will eat i was so happy to find a large size because you can usually only buy the tiny containers in pet stores the oz is a better bargain my cat prefers this over kitty caviar and it smells a lot fresher this is high quality healthy treat for any cat

positive,11/6/21,i had been looking for a healthier breakfast this has worked great for me i can add a variety of food items to this to add variety i prepare a large quantity in a rice cooker and store it in the refrigerator when it is time to eat an amount can be dished up and various ingredients can be added chopped walnuts blue berries honey cinamon brown sugar etc not all at once milk is added and then re heated in the microwave i think it makes a great healthy breakfast or any time meal

positive,11/6/21,don t be swayed by what some reviewers are saying about annie s natural shells and aged cheddar mac and cheese i almost didn t purchase this product because of some of the reviews i read on here but i m glad i did it s not only healthy and fast but actually pretty tasty too if you re expecting something all natural that tastes like kraft you re going to be disappointed kraft s sauce is thicker and sweeter but annie s sauce tastes less processed and has a better all around flavor i prefer the aged cheddar mac and cheese to the white cheddar one which was very bland try adding a little extra butter to enhance the flavor of the sauce
positive,9/7/21,eat think smile granola clusters cinnamon almond is ounces of good eating healthy yet delicious granola clusters with almonds and cinnamon get the extra treatment of cocoa powder this delicious coating adds antioxidants and taste whole grains give these treats thumbs up for me but all these healthy elements do add up to calories per cup serving perfect for snacking right out of the bag or i would eat them with milk or on top of yogurt although these are definitely vegetarian i do not know if they are vegan as the ingredient list includes sugar and honey the product s website did not disclose that it is in fact vegan so i would assume not i highly recommend this tasty healthy snack
positive,22/6/21,i adopted my adorable edmund last year from a shelter they sent me home with a small bag of felidae not grain free version cat and kitten formula as he was a kitten at the time i am very concerned about eating healthy whole foods so i of course want the best for my kitty as well i did research and found that cats digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains fruits vegetables directly and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey s stomachs ie if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it so i wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what s found in nature as possible without breaking the bank he already seemed to really like the felidae grain included version so as soon as my starter bag ran out i immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has only eaten this ever since i got him he loves it i give him one small scoop of this grain free kibble in the morning and then a quarter or so of a large oz felidae grain free can of food we ve tried both the turkey chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and edmund prefers the turkey chicken but will of course eat anything i give him he has the absolute softest shiniest fur coat i have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy i have to blame at least some of this on the fact he only eats grain free felidae food the rest is because i love him so ridiculously much i love the free shipping on amazon i buy a case of canned and a bag of dry or of one at the same time i used to buy this elsewhere and since it s so heavy shipping would often be almost as much as the product
positive,2/8/21,very tasty and fiber rich cereal i ate it cold with soy milk and finished the box off myself i am buying more
positive,11/6/21,i prefer this almond milk to any other i enjoy the genuine mild almond taste and don t need nor want any sweeteners vanilla flavors or other unnecessary distractions there is no bitterness with this milk like there is with some other major brands very tasty and very healthy mere calories per serving cruelty free too i only take this almond milk i used to buy it in my local store but they discontinued it and i like it so much that i now have to order it on amazon
positive,8/7/21,this is one of my favorite healthy cereals it has a good mix of textures and the flavors are sweet and indulgent eating it you definitely do not feel like you are eating a health nut cereal i am a huge fan of banana so i really enjoy the distinguishable sweet and fruity flavor they lend the cereal as well as the slight nuttiness from the flax the green tea is really subtle almost undetectable and doesn t really affect the flavor of the cereal the only downside is that this cereal is a little more calorically dense than some of the other healthy cereals on the market it is calories for cup with grams of fiber and grams of protein while kashi golean cereal ounce boxes pack of has only calories grams of fiber and g of protein in a cup as a result optimum rebound isn t as filling and i find myself feeling hungrier faster than i do if i ve had kashi golean for breakfast however the flavor of optimum rebound is much sweeter and more complex so understandably you have to sacrefice nutritionals a bit for something that is tastier however it is still much healthier than many mainstream sugary cereals i find myself typically making up the difference by mixing some optimum rebound into my kashi golean for flavor this gives me the best of both words however this is still a great cereal overall and will especially appeal to you if you find cereals like kashi golean to be too bland

positive,15/1/21,we really like the mccann s steel cut oats but find we don t cook it up too often this tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenient anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing
positive,8/6/21,these taste really good i have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture i agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer there is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items order in cold weather and buy enough to last
positive,7/1/21,the mouth says how do i love thee let me count the ways if you like apple products a must have item the only draw back shipping cost these are very heavy
positive,17/4/21,i ve been a fan of hot spicy maruchan ramen for a long time if you enjoy spice and love ramen you ll love this product too bad it s way too expensive here on amazon it s only per at my walmart
positive,10/3/21,i love this flavor of ramen i don t eat other flavors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison for the convenience of having it delivered to my home i have prime so i get it in two days and don t have to pay for the shipping the price on amazon isn t bad at all but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store

positive,7/2/21,these are the best tasting tuna pack they make in my opinion make a great on the go snack and really satisfying with the tomato
positive,29/3/21,i found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there excellent quality and no need to dress it up i put it the micro on about power for minute and shazam i believe a little heating brings out the flavor
positive,10/3/21,tastes great and gives me energy without the jitters love this product however i do wish it came in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a zip lock pouch because the zip lock ripped off and quit working after awhile but the product is fantastic just not crazy about the packaging
positive,10/7/21,these mints are really strong and have a great taste they are also a convenient size to carry in a pocket or purse
positive,27/1/21,i m trying several of the wu yi teas i like this one particularly because of the subtle citrus taste it also has a natural sweetness the ingredients include organic wu li cliff oolong tea mg organic black tea mg organic green tea extract mg proprietary blend mg plus some ginseng panax orange peel lemon grass and guarana other ingredients natual orange and citrus flavors my goal is to drink more tea and less coffee i am enjoying trying a different kind of tea every day i ll be coming back to this one
positive,14/8/21,a very delicate green tea with a smooth light taste and an subtle floral tones and no bitter aftertaste in the years we have been drinking ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed the superb quality of ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years i am so happy to find ahmad teas available here thanks amazon because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away the current deal for the pack of is superb much cheaper than i can find locally this is a great tasting tea which i am happy to recommend
positive,21/4/21,so many healthy products don t taste very good or taste good when you first try them and then go downhill i ve had these chips on more than one occasion and they are very tasty i ve served them to guests twice and both times they wanted to know what they were and where to get them it s also nice to have something gluten free for friends who are borderline diabetic but i would eat them anyway
positive,17/4/21,i was looking for a natural energy shot that works and i found it steaz energy shot is my favorite i recently had gastric bypass surgery so tons of sugar is a no no and i m also allergic to sucralose splenda so most other energy drinks are out i tried bazi energy shots and they didn t work as well as steaz and definitely didn t taste as well these have a taste that s almost like coca cola not bad at all if you re looking for natural energy give these a try
positive,10/3/21,i first found steaz berry energy shots at a local organic market i bought two bottles which cost just under three dollars each i fell in love instantly the drink is delicious i can taste the yerba mate and the acai juice like a slightly bitter fruity chocolate honey tea i am very sensitive to sucralose splenda which is in so many energy drinks these days i also hate the taste i love that steaz has actual sugar and no artificial sweeteners the rush it gives me is slow and even i have several medical conditions including fibromyalgia which saps me of energy and causes intense pain i like how steaz helps clear away the fatigue and fog so i can get things done no caffeine jitters even though there are mg of caffeine in each bottle it was becoming expensive for me to buy the bottles separately at stores so i started looking online for a bulk price i am so thrilled to have found the pack of on amazon i signed up for amazon prime specifically for this product hah

positive,30/6/21,i bought this strawberry extract hoping to spruce up a strawberry wine that ended up with less flavor than i d original expected a common problem in some fruit wines this is indeed good strawberry flavor just add to your sugary concoction be it a baking good a dessert or a drink to either give strawberry flavor or add to existing flavor and presto just about everyone will be licking their lips and maybe fingers for those interested i found the right addition to a liquid volume to be oz of extract per gallon of liquid
positive,1/3/21,this is just fantastic chicken noodle soup the best i have ever eaten with large hearty chunks of chicken and vegetables and nice large noodles this soup is just so full bodied and is seasoned just right i am so glad amazon carries this product i just can t find it here in vermont

positive,10/3/21,the thing about marmite is that those who don t like it hate it and those who love it can t live without it it s very much an english thing and the language has even adopted the trade name as a metaphor as in victoria beckham is marmite meaning that those who don t like her etc amazon has done the world a favor by making this weird and wonderful stuff available at an affordable price last time i looked it was a g jar in british stores in l a county or about x what it costs in england the amazon supplier was quick and efficient and i now have enough marmite to last me to the end of the year or would have if i didn t decide to send one of the two jars to my son in japan good job amazon
positive,30/5/21,one of the best chips that you can buy and i ve tried all the kettle varieties and many others there s only a slight taste of jalapeno and they are delicious perfect with a sandwich or alone if you like being addicted these are the chip for you see you at addicts anonymous

positive,20/4/21,i simply fell in love with these chips and refused to share them with my friends my experience with a lot of cheese favored chips has been too salty and a little over the greasy side but these ny cheddar from kettle really changed my mind thanks to amazon for great discounts and i don t have to buy them from the store anymore

positive,28/9/20,i tried this before having normal red tea so i waited to review the flavor still rings in my head it is earthier than rooibos tea and less frity the color is that of muddy water and it has the grittiness and viscosity of it as well well worth every penny
positive,16/11/20,my poland spring driver gave us this new tea to try and our family really enjoyed it i looked at the ingredients and was quite pleased with the natural ingredients and no calories

positive,18/12/19,these are identical to jay s hot chips are they made by the same company they have a slightly sweet taste with a nice bit of heat definately not overwhelming heat on a heat scale of i would give these about a regarding the texture these are not kettle cooked chips so they do not have much crunch they are comparable to regular lays chips for about a bag they are a great deal
positive,19/1/20,i first had these uncle ray s chips a few years ago while traveling out west i tracked them down on amazon and recognized the name they are just as good as i remember smoky sweet with just enough kick and there s adequate seasoning on all of the chips each bag also has a little story courtesy of uncle ray that usually has some moral message or anecdote they are pretty funny but not intentionally my only problem with these chips is their texture they re a bit thin and there s not much of a crunchy texture otherwise these are good chips and well worth trying out
positive,14/4/21,if you re looking at choice tea you re probably already aware that this extraordinary company was a pioneer in the use of organic fair trade ingredients for tea but choice is also innovative both in design and in creative ingredient combinations as for design lychee white is part of choice s new line characterized by an innovative biodegradable pyramid shaped tea bag which allows for the use of regular loose tea leaves as for creative ingredient combinations this healthy white tea is enhanced by the ethereal marriage of natural lychee flavor and sublime organic osmanthus blossoms the flavor and scent is one to savor and celebrate
positive,24/4/21,i prefer the taste of this over the alcohol based vanilla extracts particularly in uncooked items and beverages it has a fairly thick syrupy consistency
positive,28/4/21,raw organic fair trade tastes great what s not to love my hope is that as more people buy their amazing chocolates that the price will come down a bit
positive,12/7/21,being the candy lover that i am i wanted to buy some cute lollipops that i could pull out of my bag and enjoy whenever i felt like it for that purpose alone i d give them five stars however at first lick the lollipop has a slightly off taste but this goes away after a minute and is not unbearable or disgusting in any way i laughed quite a bit at the reviews of outraged individuals because the lollipops are made in china i m not dead dying sick good enough as well the text on the wrapper is fine i wasn t repulsed by it and i m not afraid to share i d only rewrap them if they were for presentation rather than eating the colors are not as vivid as in the picture and the lolipops are not glazed so they do not have that shiny look that many others have none of mine came broken and they were well wrapped i m happy with my purchase and plan on eating them all minus the few that i share with friends but i d try something different next time
positive,18/12/19,i was surprised at the size of these potatoes i have bought them at my local grocery store before and was disappointed that they were so small these are perfect tasty cook just right love them
positive,19/1/20,excellent and tasty though i thought not enough garlic so i added more when i order garlic i guess i expect more of it but perfect if you have guests as it will never offend anyone omaha always is sure to do everything to please their customers a premier company hard to find anymore
positive,28/4/21,i like them but nothing unique about the flavor basically saves you from having to make them at home a little pricey but for a treat what the heck
positive,8/8/20,this tea is so helpful for congestion and it tastes great too make sure you let it steep as long as the directions say it really seems to help you to feel better
positive,18/12/19,i love these wild cherry tic tacs and they are impossible to find in stores i am so glad that i can get them from amazon and the price is excellent they are a great low calorie treat and i will keep buying them from amazon highly recommend this purchase
positive,19/1/20,i have recently been on a low carb diet as i find that i can no longer tolerate even natural sugars like agave honey and dates these raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin a hormone whose message is store fat insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore i would bloat from a high carb diet my dilemma is that i love sweets and now it is not a problem thanks to products like stevia a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years it has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar although for some people there might be a bit as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar stevia used to be legal in the usa only as a cosmetic product because of politics companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition yet aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis so i would use stevia at times but the aftertaste was bad and to be honest i wasn t too crazy about the during taste either then i tried nunaturals this product is awesome and like no other stevia i have tried it is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste unless you put in way too much a common mistake by people new to this it comes in tablets and in powdered form in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings it also comes in alcohol free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor unlike aspartame which becomes even more toxic when heated stevia can be used in baking nunaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that since i am a raw fooder i can t tell you how it tastes but i am sure it is good judging by their other products thanks to these great products i can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets
positive,3/8/20,this is the best tasting stevia powder i ve tried most other powders have a weird after taste but this one doesn t i recently bought a lb bag of it online and i m making my way through it
positive,29/7/21,this has been the best tasting stevia i have tried i also think this is a better value than some of the others i really like not having to open all the packets when i make a gallon of tea
positive,8/7/20,i bought the nunaturals white stevia with maltodextrin several months ago as i m trying to cut back on sugar and artificial sweeteners the first morning i tried it in my coffee and hated it it tastes just as bitter as equal or sweet n low i decided to give it another try that same day in my lemonade and it was absolutely delicious i ve also tried it in hot tea and it is bitter but wonderful in iced tea so i think hot drinks bring out the bitterness in stevia all in all i m glad i bought this and also a box of the packets which are very convenient on the go i have tried many different brands of stevia but so far this is the only one i have not thrown out i also tried truvia not a fan it makes your coffee or tea taste like licorice
positive,13/4/21,if you are trying to get off sugar this is the product for you i has a great sweet taste without spiking your insulin and no bitter aftertaste great for diabetics and anyone trying to eat healthy i love this product
positive,20/2/21,i have tried various brands of stevia but i always come back to nunaturals i buy the ounce container because i use it to sweeten everything if you have a sweet tooth as i do but don t need the added pounds then this is the ticket for you i drink a lot of tea and this is my sweetener a lot of other stevia brands leave a bitter after taste but this is the best that i have found to resolve that problem highly recommended
positive,9/12/20,i was looking for a healthier alternative to splenda and equal nustevia taste great and this container lasts a long time
positive,1/4/21,i discovered this product a couple of years ago and really liked the taste in coffee tea and on fruit and oatmeal it was a lot less expensive in the packets then but i ve switched to the large oz container and the price is very good i don t use sugar and this helps me have the sweet and not the increased blood sugar yeah
positive,25/2/21,love this on a toasted bagel with cream cheese and scallions or even dill great way to enjoy caviar and not break the bank
positive,19/1/20,forget starbucks peets or anything else this is the real deal like a good vintage wine britt coffee is truly gourmet with no after taste i am really fussy about coffee and generally avoid it but after a trip to costa rica fell in love with the beverage again you have to use a french press to get the full favor so throw away those other coffee making contraptions your beans deserve the best your taste buds deserve the best too no i don t work for britt and did not get paid to say this but if you guys at britt read this send me a sample or two
positive,14/10/20,great tasting coffiee one of the best i ve ever had the problem here is the high shipping costs
positive,10/3/21,these radiation treated dinners that don t need freezing are a great convenience i ve tried quite a few of the hormel compleats and this is one of my favorites home cookin it ain t and it s a bit too salty but for a satisfying meal in seconds it s hard to beat the only reason i ve given this flavorful decently chicken filled dish stars instead of is because the rice is white we all know by now that whole grains are healthier so until these companies start making their dishes with whole wheat pasta and brown rice i ll mark them down
positive,15/8/21,if you want a hot meal with no effort that is delious this is the way while cooking noodles microwave left over meat hot dog boloni sp also microwave a spoon or two of vegetable left over frozen canned after noodles cook add season packet pour over meat veg after a minute pour some of the liquid out you have a wonderful meal with less sodium because you poured it out college kids live off this meal because it is cheap quick and can all be done in microwave if need be you can get a case of libby s carot peas from amazon for about since you are using only a spoon or two lasts a long time
positive,27/4/21,sure i could have gone on a food crusade at the local grocery to find a similar product but i don t think i would have found a product as good and tasty as dr mcdougall the noodles are quick and easy to prepare and above all else tasty enough to satisfy my appetite i was surprised that there were enough peanuts in every bite just like at a thai food restaurant overall i m pleased with my order and the quality of the product
positive,24/1/21,these jelly beans are wonderful they are smaller than regular jelly beans but that doesn t take away the flavor i would recommand these to anyone
positive,14/7/20,just a quick note a very good friend of mine who also battles weight issues and love pasta turned me on to this product we bought a box at whole foods and i was impressed by the taste but especially by the low calories and high fiber content amazingly it s about cheaper at amazon than at whole foods and being an amazon prime customer saved me on shipping i ll be back for more soon i love quality and a bargain
positive,5/6/21,i am on a low carb diet and have lost pounds i was so tired of eating meat all the time but too nervous to splurge on pasta until i came across this product on amazon i cook it a minute or two longer than the directions and top it with full fat greek yogurt and parm cheese and one serving is so filling and yummy definitely cures my cravings and am now on subscribe and save my hubby and son love it too
positive,9/7/21,so many different flavors to choose from i ordered this brand for the first time and the taste is wonderful it was the only decaf french vanilla i could find i have decided to switch from my old brand to this one
positive,5/6/21,provided you use clean preferably purified water to cook this it can be a great tasting hold over to a main meal far superior to most instant noodle packages out there and for the most part gluten and meat free except for the shrimp flavor while some people have remarked on the over sized packaging this actually allows for a good and thorough mixing of the flavor packets and noodles with little chance of spillage while the coconut ginger variety tastes good it may be a bit too subtle for those looking for an actual taste of thai i d recommend the thai peanut noodles for those seeking something with a bit more of a pronounced thai flavor and highly recommend the a taste of thai peanut salad dressing added to salads meats or the peanut noodles for a very spicy thai experience overall for the taste and quantity the subscribe and save offer provides the best deal comparatively speaking in terms of price wal mart offers most of these noodles a few cents cheaper compared to the subscription price but do not seem to carry the coconut ginger variety at least not at the store near me if you haven t tried this brand of instant noodles yet i think you ll be in for a treat
positive,25/7/21,i really like this soup it is mild and i don t like anything that is to hot it is just right has a good flavor and is something i can take to work and pop in the microwave i would buy it again and again
positive,13/7/21,the thai coconut ginger noodles are quick and easy to prepare you will be rewarded with delicious noodles to enjoy by yourself or share as a side dish with another noodle enjoyer
positive,8/7/21,while the restaurants always do it best these curry pastes are pretty tasty it s easy to use fast and you can add the meat and veggies of your choice for those of you scared of something spicy you might use a little less but for most it s just right and for those that like it spicier you can add a little crushed red pepper since the coconut milk has to be added separately you can also control the fat content you can go light or go with the much yummier creamy stuff i find the green curry is a little sweeter than the red and panang curries and is maybe a little less spicy
positive,15/7/21,i just ordered this came today and thought i would just try it well to my amazement my little daisy ate it and wanted more my little dog is just yrs but has trouble with flare ups with her pancreas i have to avoid fats and corn with her and she needs more fiber i have been making her dog food but she missed eating the dry i wondered if it was small enough for her to chew but it was
positive,6/7/21,everyone should know this is a healthier dog food than walmart brands like purina iams or god forbid moist meaty ingredients like ground flax seed peas whole carrots whole sweet potatoes apples blueberries and probiotics and the lack of sweeteners by products and low quality corn show this to be true i just did a taste test with this harmonic farms and my dogs old iams proactive health and decided to make the results known i let him smell both thoroughly without letting him eat at first and placed the two piles a bit apart he immediately went for the harmonic farms finished it and didn t even look at the iams before coming back to me wagging his tail hoping for more dogadvisor com made me aware of my past mistakes in dog food choices and i was hoping to god he would not shy away from the healthy organic stuff like i do to my great welcome surprise he didn t i guess he s a hippie at heart i on the other hand will take my nachos bell grande
positive,13/8/21,these tastes good if it s not fried not bad for you and tastes good then why not eat them of course not a lot at once but these are great healthier snacks
positive,5/6/21,a while ago i got a bag of the bbq at a store to go with my lunch and i loved these so when i was searching amazon and found these on subscribe and save i knew that this was something that i had to have for my lunches i love the fact you get all the different flavors and as of yet i have not found a flavor i did not like being from england i am very picky about my flavors of chips or crisps as i would call them as there seems to be such limited flavors but this box gives me flavors i can t complain i also love the fact that fat is the fat content which just makes them an even better snack my only issue now is that i have to fight my husband and son over them because they love them just as much as i do i have now had to go to a box a month but even then i am not sure i can have enough for the month with the three of us eating them every chance we can
positive,9/7/21,good flavorful chips too bad the selection does not include jalape ntilde o or paramsan garlic packaging is difficult to open but they fresh
positive,17/6/21,these are really good tasting chips they aren t too unhealthy so you can eat a fair amount love the flavoring
positive,31/8/21,these really are good i gave some to other people and they liked them too the plain flavored ones take well to using them as scoops for your own dip or salsa when eating the bbq flavored ones brings back memories of yester years when i would eat bbq pork skins while riding in the back of the truck on the range i think the pepper ones could use more pepper but they are all still good and make a good snack or side dish to lunch at cal per pack
positive,7/8/21,i bought these when they were on a gold box deal thinking that it would be a nice inexpensive toss in for a month of lunches and then i d never buy them again not so they re actually really tasty exceptionally crunchy and the flavor is similar to kettle cooked chips definitely going on subscribe and save for a while i don t think they re any more salty than standard potato chips but they re by no means low salt
positive,6/9/21,popchips don t taste like a lot of the other lowfat salty snack options they are light in taste and big on crunch great alternative to potato chips i m not a fan of the bbq flavor but i do like the sea salt vinegar salt pepper alot and sour cream and onion like the individual bags perfect for on the go and lunches
positive,5/6/21,these are better than any low calorie chips i ve ever had and i prefer them to normal chips they are wonderful oprah even loves them i would buy this box again and probably will because i love that these are calorie packs the barbeque and salt and vinegar ones are awesome
positive,9/7/21,these taste wonderful guilt free if you can stop at one bag will definitly buy again
positive,19/6/21,what s to say pop chips are great kudos to the pop chip makers
positive,5/9/21,i really liked these chips they came recommended from my friend and i really like them the variety pack is great to try all of the flavors although there were some i wasn t so fond of the cheddar bbq and salt pepper chips are great the traditional ones are get this traditional no excitement there the chips are great my brother still asks if i have any around the house but i haven t yet purchased them again hint the have the texture of the snack munchos
positive,10/10/21,i love popchips the bag now has only calories and it bit smaller but if you are craving pop chips without the fat and still taste great these are for you a bit pricey but worth it
positive,11/9/21,we love popchips but they re hard to find at our local grocery stores i was very excited to find this variety pack which has flavors some of which we d never tried before in single serve packages right around calories a piece our favorites were the original sea salt vinegar and sour cream onion but all of the flavors were good these were perfect for snacks but they also made for easy lunches we ll definitely order again
positive,26/8/21,these are great because they re only calories per pack and are just as good if not better than other chips out there the original style taste exactly like munchos but don t come with the high calorie count the other flavors sour cream onion salt vinegar salt pepper cheddar and bbq are all delicious as well
positive,26/7/21,i am potato chip addicted i don t only enjoy potato chips but i also enjoy any type of potato product this product really hit the mark for me i consider these a full fledged snack each bag is packed with chips they are moderately seasoned and full of flavor the consistency is slightly like a popcorn cake but they re crisp and crunchy not puffy they have a distinct potato taste the best part each bag clocks in at only calories and i repeat these are not a simple calorie snack what you get here is a full bag of chips what s great about the content vs calorie content is that these are perfect to accompany your lunch without feeling guilty about eating a calorie bag of chips my personal favorites were the sea salt and vinegar and the original the barbecue flavor is sweet not smoky the salt and pepper cheddar and sour cream and onion flavors are standard fair but the chips are adequately and evenly seasoned and i did not notice differences in seasoning from one chip to the next these are a great product well manufactured and a treat to eat i ll definitely buy more of these in the future
positive,11/9/21,this doesn t taste as addicting as the real fried potato chips but it s still very good considering it s low in calories and it s only popped it taste much better than the ones that are freeze dried these pops taste as light as the rice crispy treats but with a good amount of flavor and crunch i like it a small little pack that you can just grab when you feel like having something quick i keep then in my room in case if i ever get the cravings for chips all the flavors that come in are good too no complains the package also arrived fast and it s pretty cheap i would recommend people who is watching calories to get this
positive,11/9/21,i love popchips they may take some time getting used to if you re used to the oiliness of potato chips but they re only calories per bag buying a pack saves you money per bag but you re sooo tempted to eat them with so many bags around
positive,15/9/21,i m very picky when it comes to chips i ve gone through so many but this one really hits the spot it has just the right amount of crunch with just the right amount of flavor it s also great to know that you re not eating something that s bad for you with calories a pack it s definitely the ideal snack
positive,5/6/21,i have subscribed these chips they are so tasty not dry or oily cannot put it down once open a bag and have to have two bags in a row
positive,14/9/21,the flavor of this natural sea salt is more nuanced and a bit richer than the typical table salt we re all accustomed to although describing such subtleties is difficult one noteworthy fact is that this salt contains less sodium than conventional table salt mg per teaspoon versus mg per teaspoon of conventional table salt another thing to keep in mind is that this natural salt is not iodized as our thyroid glands require trace amounts of iodine it may not be wise to entirely eliminate iodized salt from your diet
positive,29/9/21,this is the best tasting pancake mix in the market and it is so easy to make
positive,10/7/21,this waffle and pancake mix is delicious you can taste a subtle hint of vanilla in them they are the only pancakes waffles that my kids love and the house smells wonderful when they are cooking
positive,1/3/20,this is a great mix i mixed it with milk instead of water just follow the directions
positive,28/7/20,we are into our third can of this flavorful and easy mix and it just seems to get better and better sunday is pancake day at our house and today we had blueberry pancakes with real maple syrup this mix holds fresh blueberries nicely don t over mix the ingredients and you will get nice fluffy fruit filled or not pancakes that are absolutely first rate
positive,28/7/20,the pancakes were delicious but they weren t as fluffy as the ones i normally make next time i use this i m going to whip the egg whites and see if that helps
positive,3/8/19,i ve bought them many times good quality and good taste baby love it and i love it too reccommend it
positive,6/2/21,my year old son does really like these andthey certainly taste better than some of the other finger food snacks the only issue is there are lots of crumbs in the can they come in so it gets messy if you want to dump them into a baggie for on the go
positive,24/2/21,these are a great alternative to chips i wasn t sure how they would be based on other reviews but i am glad i bought them and wish i would of found them sooner i have twin month olds and they can t get enough of them i like them too
positive,13/5/21,i purchased this at my local health food store and i am enjoying it immensely the juice has a nice robust texture and it is not overly salty the flavor is amazingly fresh and refreshing i combine it with odwalla flash pasteurized carrot juice for a well above average vegetable juice that is a good energy booster and makes for a great alternative to orange juice or other sweet juices enjoy
positive,1/3/20,i discovered these when my daughter was about months old i wish i had found them earlier they are organic taste great are easy for toddlers to handle and very convenient i always keep some in my purse and in the car when we re out and about they are not messy unless of course they decide to squeeze the pouch which only happens for us when she s not hungry the plum organics line also includes some varieties with fruits and vegetables mixed together they taste surprisingly good and are one way to get my picky eater to eat some veggies you can find some varieties at reasonable prices on amazon others are more expensive for some reason babies r us has had a sale every other month or so where you can get them for each if you buy them in sets of that is usually when i stock up for the next two months
positive,28/7/20,not as tasty as the strawberry but still very nice great to throw in a diaper bag or purse spendy but definitely a good deal when it s on sale
positive,13/5/20,this tea is very good i discovered it while visiting in california the moment i got home i searched local stores for it and i was not able to find it finally i decided to see if amazon had it and they did and i bought two boxes as long as they make it i will buy it
positive,26/3/21,you just can t beat the taste of the original dubble bubble gumballs it really doesn t matter that the taste only last a minute or so but that is why i bought the tub the tub by the way is very convenient and was shipped to me in a condition if your longing for the classic taste go for it you will not be dissappointed
positive,7/2/21,a nearby fresh and easy neighborhood market stocks a number of gourmet imported products and i enjoy trying them one is a variety of baxters soups from canada today i had the butternut squash and red pepper soup quite good smooth and mellow mild taste but delicious goes down real easy and it only comes to calories per serving servings per can alas the sodium content is a bit higher than i like otherwise very good gary peterson
positive,7/8/20,as a person who love cinnamon scent and flavor i find this tea amazing i was used to drinking the plain black tea at work and this blend is a nice change from that i can probably only have one or two cups a day because it is pretty sweet but i will continue to drink it probably every day enjoy
positive,1/3/20,i love this tea which has a deep cinnamon aroma and taste it s equally good as an iced tea full marks
positive,28/7/20,i was actually surprised at how good these muffins taste i have reordered a case and they are gluten free
positive,14/9/21,although i ve only been able to try three of caribou s k cup blends mahogany as well as caribou coffee caribou blend k cup portion pack for keurig k cup brewers count and caribou coffee daybreak morning blend k cup portion pack for keurig k cup brewers count i ve found that caribou consistently produces the highest quality k cups they are head and shoulders above their competitors like green mountain and van houtte i should mention that caribou s daybreak blend is far and away my favorite k cup flavor of the or so i ve been able to sample so far but i enjoy a flavorful medium roast my boyfriend on the other hand prefers an extra bold dark roast after our favorable experience with the caribou brand before we picked up a box of this coffee and hoped that it would be a great choice for a dark blend let me just say that mahogany is full of smokey delicious flavor it s quite strong and dark but there is no rancid bitterness or acidity that accompanies a lot of the dark roasts this coffee packs a powerful punch although that isn t normally my thing i can enjoy a cup of this with milk and a bit of sweetener my boyfriend adores it though and it has become a staple blend for him i will still drink this on occasion but it s a bit too potent for me i think this is the best dark roast i ve had the chance to try
positive,17/12/20,i like the taste of this coffee tried the other brands but got stuck on this one i also like the eco friendliness of the company
positive,2/5/20,strong smooth velvety flavor mahogany describes the color and the mood you get when drinking absolutely the best i ve found my favorite
positive,14/7/21,i like strong coffee but i don t want it to taste burnt or have an acidic after taste caribou coffee s mahogany is full bodied with a nice balance of dark notes and acidity it s one of my go to coffees when my favorites like coffee people s wake up call are out of stock
positive,18/7/19,i like my coffee strong this is the first brand that i have tasted that provides the kick i need without the bitterness i keep my pantry stocked with mahogony and i do not share
positive,1/3/20,i happen to like foods that are not as sweet as kool aid or other sugary drinks very refreshing after mowing the lawn and helped keep those afternoon headaches away
positive,28/7/20,i saw this item in my local grocery store and i thought i would give it a try i have to admit i was very surprised about how much i enjoyed this item i found it refreshing and i felt that i had a bit more energy i would happily purchase this product again and again a word of advice to people complaining that it doesn t taste coconutty enough coconut water and coconut milk are two very different things coconut water comes from a green immature coconut while the milk comes from what we all think of when we think of a coconut a hard brown fiber covered she will just like a green banana and a ripe banana taste different the same can be said of coconut if you don t think of this as a coconut drink or a pina colada you will probably enjoy it even more
positive,13/6/20,i decided to try this although i am not a big fan of flavored waters it is quite refreshing and the flavors are quite vibrant and not weak as in some concoctions i happen to like both coconut and pineapple so there is no problem with the basic idea and both can be distinguished in the mix the one drawback for some is because pineapple is a rather strong addition even a splash puts it up front and center this added to the coconut may make it far too sweet for some it would certainly be a good pick me up after a workout or in my case after shoeveling the snow that seems to be deposited regularly this winter in the northeast
positive,10/3/20,this seems like a pretty straightforward drink it s coconut juice and it s pineapple juice with a bit of sugar and not much else they claim it s a good source of potassium and electrolytes for me it was pretty tasty granted it was also very sweet is it a health drink i don t know if i d go that far it has vitamin c and trace amounts of calcium iron but not much else other than sugar for what it is something sweet to sip it s pretty good
positive,14/5/19,this is really delicious and not something you can find in the local grocery store if you did it would be very expensive and a much smaller quantity this is a good deal and super easy to use
positive,19/10/20,mrs may s dry roasted snack pumpkin crunch ounce pouches pack of pumpkin crunch is great stick with oz size servings much too easy to consume entire oz bag without realizing it d lol
positive,1/3/20,i picked up a box of this in a discount grocery store in paso robles the cake was heavenly i liked it so much i found another store that sold the mix as well as the icing and there is even a pink lemonade cookie mix which i bought but haven t tried yet the taste is of course lemon but it reminds me a bit of that flavored mix country time i drank as a kid but less tangy its very light and refreshing i simply loved it hope this is more than just a seasonal flavor
positive,28/7/20,no doubt about it this is just the right combination of lobster scampi prawns with a hint of dry white wine a dash of brandy finish this soup to perfection ingredients water lobster cod scampi concentrated tomato paste modified cornflour white wine prawns skimmed milk powder butterfat double cream salt yeast extract sugar shrimp powder fish powder vegetable oil vegetable extracts stabiliser polyphosphates brandy concentrated lemon juice spices herb and spice extracts with celery no artificial colours no artificial flavours no artificial preservatives information gluten free contains milk fish shellfish celery
positive,28/3/21,if you like nuts and you re looking for a healthy great tasting snack you can t go wrong with almond crunch my husband and i recently eliminated high fructose corn syrup and partially hydrogenated soybean oil from our diet and we feel so much better trying to find tasty snacks that don t contain these products is not easy so we were thrilled to find mrs mays naturals we love the cashew crunch as well
positive,6/2/20,the nuts used tasted very fresh the bite sized chunks were just right it is lightly sweetened but not too sweet very satisfying
positive,3/8/20,so i usually consider pasta to be pasta to be pasta it s usually all the same to me however when i tried this brand of pasta i noticed that it does taste better i can t describe how exactly but it does i thought maybe it was my imagination maybe knowing it s organic was influencing my judgment but my sister commented on it when i served it for her one day she wanted to know where i got it it tasted so good hmmm so while usually there isn t much of a taste difference when it comes to noodles and pasta for this brand there is it s subtle but it s there when we moved from california i discovered they didn t sell it in the stores here in ny so i was elated when i found amazon carries it elated over a simple pasta yes that s how good it is in comparison mmmmmm mmmmm
positive,15/4/19,i have long searched for a great linguine and spagetti and this is it just made linguine with clam sauce and each time my husband remarks how terrific it is i buy in packages of for both spagetti and linguine and will reorder when close to being out
positive,9/3/18,absolutely delicious have tried it on everything from meat and fish to scrambled eggs highly recommend it
positive,27/2/18,i found this stuff to be very tasty great with jasmine rice or just as a snack i don t mind a little message if it enhances the flavor
positive,22/3/18,this is my family s favorite brand of wheat free gluten free cake mix this brand is moist tasty and closer to the traditional cake mixes people are used to namaste products are the best in my opinion of what s available out there in health food stores try it you won t be disappointed
positive,12/3/18,i used this mix to make a x cake in a glass pan using grapeseed oil spring water and free range eggs i thought the cake had a nice flavor to it but it was not what i was expecting i was craving a white cake like wedding cake and went to my local store to find something wheat free gluten free and dairy free i purchased this vanilla cake mix i think it is a very good mix i couldn t really taste the vanilla flavor but thought it had a nice flavor the cake is yellow dense but not like a pound cake and texture y like brown rice has more texture than white rice i thought the sweetness was just right i think i would purchase again but would make pineapple upside down cake with it
positive,9/2/18,took me years to find the ultimate chewing gum but when i found wrigley s orbit white peppermint the search ended i ve been chewing this gum for many years now i occasionally try something else but nothing ever wins the peppermint in this gum can wipe out the worst of bad breath and toward the end of its chewable life it doesn t start to taste awful or give you worse breath as many gums will do it simply loses its flavor only drawbacks i usually chew pieces at a time so they are a bit small and they just changed the packaging it used to fit nicely in your back pant pocket inside suit jacket pocket etc now its twice as thick and poorly layed out so it s bulky not sure why they had to change probably to do with retail stores layout this won t prevent me from buying it but it s really annoying wrigley just never change the flavor
positive,7/12/17,for quite a while before amazon starting retailing food items it was nearly impossible to locate this healthy underground favorite brownie mix there were blogs and food sites bemoaning how hard it was to locate so when we saw it on amazon we ordered a case and baked up batches for all our friends and family the concensus was it tastes healthier but never the less quite good it is far better when prepared with at least a cup of mini chocolate chips not regular chips which can sink to the bottom we buy good quality belgian chocolate minichips this mix is a great alternative if you want less guilt in your guilty pleasures
positive,24/5/19,if you like goat cheese and smoked cheeses you will love this it has a very smokey creamy flavor try it spread on crackers with a little black truffle oil
positive,18/5/18,this was my first purchase of this water it tastes great and the bottles are thicker than most also everyone likes that name haha
positive,23/3/18,surprisingly tasty thin and crip very cracker like and good for snacking i got these for my husband who is on a very low sodium diet these are great for when we travel it isn t easy finding prepackaged low sodium foods that taste good but these work quite well
positive,8/9/20,if you like green tea that brews for minutes max and you do not stew your tea by just leaving the bag in until the tea is bitter this is the tea for you of course it can be done that way but if you have refined tea taste then you will like this tea i personally love the taste of a good green tea i am so glad to find this brand available online no one sells it in my area
positive,18/7/20,i have purchased other hot cocoa cups but find grove square to be about the best of them all i usually add two teaspoons of the the flavored coffeemate creamers my favorite being the sugar free caramel macchiato by adding the sugar free creamer the taste is there but not the calories
positive,14/6/18,this hot coca tastes pretty good when brewed on oz setting however its not the best i ve ever tasted nor the worst its hard to rate this because everyone has different tastes so its ether you like it or you don t i my self happen to like it and will buy again unless i find something better
positive,2/11/18,i really like the flavor of this hot chocolate the kids love the flavor too i always keep a box of this in the house as my kids and their friends are avid coco drinkers this makes it easier and less messy even for the younger ones no more powder spilled on the counter tops this way
positive,14/10/18,my family really enjoys grove square hot cocoa milk chocolate and we keep a supply on hand the excellent price is what made us choose this brand but the taste is what makes us continually renew our order
positive,6/4/20,the greatest best chocolate taste in any keurig k cups out there will definitely order more everyone in the office tries to steal them i m a chocolate nut and these pass the test
positive,18/5/18,after drinking swiss miss watered down hot chocolates taste for so long this is a very tasty creamy hot chocolate my kids love it so i tried it and its the best i had in a while i will be ordering more
positive,7/3/18,a pleasant surprise awaited me when i first ordered grove square milk chocolate hot cocoa cups not a coffee drinker i use our keurig k cup brewer mostly to make cocoa and a few other brands i tried simply did not hit the mark grove square cocoa tasted full flavored with just enough chocolate essence to make it a perfect drink the first experience made me anticipate with pleasure the next time i popped a grove square k cup into the machine
positive,24/1/19,this is really tasty hot chocolate i like it much more than the dark chocolate flavor but that is just my preference
positive,27/2/19,when i weigh the convenience of a k cup against the price and the taste i would characterize these as a winner not the best cup of cocoa on the planet but compared to making it yourself or using a packet these are pretty darn good they nice a nice chocolate flavor with no funny after taste that i ve had with some other brands do not select oz on your machine though make it only at or oz otherwise it will be watery in my opinion all in all a fine cup of hot chocolate
positive,19/4/20,ok this is not the finest european chocolate but you can make it in your keurig and all flavors taste good i ve joined the club and get the lowest possible cost no charge to join and no effort to quit why not it s nice to have when you re dieting because it s just enough chocolate to keep you on track non dieters will like it for the convenience
positive,17/4/20,very good hot cocoa and price was right awesome and passing the word on the item will buy it again
positive,7/8/19,you can t beat this deal boxes of k cups for little more then no other store can even match that price for hot chocolate k cups your normally going to be paying around for k cups alone this package give you k cups for a great price the hot chocolate itself is great tasting and can be used on mostly all settings for the b except for the travel mug low in calories and great tasting defiantly a must have if you own a keurig brewing system
positive,9/3/18,not too sweet the best k cup hot chocolate i ve tried thus far the kids loved drinking and making the hot chocolate
positive,10/11/19,great taste and does not have the weird chalky after taste that other hot cocoa k cups have i ve tasted several and this by far is the better one but i have to say anything larger than oz tastes a bit watered down will definitely purchase more but at the rate my family downs these we are probably going to stick to the powdered hot cocoa to be more cost effective
positive,8/11/19,i love the flavor that this hot chocolate has it is very rich and smooth have tried other brands but did not get the results i wanted i will definately be ordering from this company again
positive,25/10/21,after trying many of the other hot cocoa k cup options i find that the grove square product tastes the best for my personal taste i find that brewing on the medium cup size setting creates the best taste just add minature marshmellows and it is a great treat however this is not hot chocolate which may be a turn off for some tasters
positive,28/9/18,bought this as a gift and was told it tastes really great too bad i don t have one of those machines otherwise i d try them out myself i might have to consider getting one if you really like it you can save some money by subscribing to it for automatic deliveries and to make sure you don t run out
positive,29/7/19,out of all of the hot chocolate kcups that i have tried this is by far the best one not weird aftertaste and not watered down tastes amazing and priced fairly what more could you ask for
positive,26/3/20,for those who do not drink coffee this is a great compliment to the teas and ciders also available for your keurig
positive,24/2/20,i am very pleased with this selection i have not tried the other hot cocoa brands for keurig but this one is awesome i bought the milk chocolate
positive,27/3/20,the hot cocoa does have a sugar substitute in it but as far as i could tell wasn t strong enough to leave that bitter aftertaste you get when they put a lot of it in the ingredients if you have a very very sophisticated palate perhaps you could taste it a little but it doesn t take away from the taste of the cocoa so as far as i m concerned it wasn t an issue i would say this is on par with the type of cocoa you d get in a coffee machine which is fine because i don t hate coffee machine cocoa i have only tried the peppermint so far and it tasted like peppermint what can i say that s what it s supposed to taste like
positive,2/12/20,the price was as fantastic as the taste so convenient to make and no messy powder that is hard to dissolve no major cleanup to deal with either highly recommended
positive,20/11/19,in my trip through the health area of my local food market i stumbled upon enjoy life boom choco boom dark chocolate bar i just can t resist trying things such as this into the cart it went it s rather good it says it s dairy nut and soy free and i ll take their word the question is taste well it s a good tasting bar i have a couple others that i would regard higher but this one is quite good it s a bit high in calories per bar but has no cholesterol or sodium not bad i ll pick it up again gary peterson
positive,2/12/20,i ve ordered most of the cheaper tea s etc add on teas and all have been great both in terms of flavor and value i cold brew using disposable tea filters closed with toothpicks in takeya airtight drink maker pitcher jug set of two and it works wonderfully those jugs are great even better if you can still find them half price at costco i m glad i ordered this when i did the price has more than doubled i d still say it s a great value this is my go to tea when i want something with a little more flavor than regular black tea i don t sweeten my tea but i think this would be a perfect sweet tea for a hot day the orange flavor is very palatable unlike some others it s noticeable without being pungent or artificial it also isn t spiced like many other orange teas
positive,11/12/19,i got this for a gift for my father and he loved them i will probably get them again but only as a gift due to the cost of sausages
positive,20/11/19,this is the best dog food i have ever purchased and having been a dog training for over years i ve purchased a lot we first tried this food when our new addition an week old german shepherd joined the family and we wanted to keep him on a natural dog food with any purebred dog health can be an issue and you don t want to fill your dog with by products and plant fillers from day one this food is praised by unbiased pet food reviewers and i don t understand why there isn t more publicity for this product our other dog a year old english bulldog with constant skin allergy issues was switched over when we discovered this brand and she has not had an allergic reaction since we didn t realize how much it had to do with diet her hair used to fall out in spring not just normal shedding but actual balding from hair loss but this has alleviated that problem as well now our shepherd is a year and a half old and he s eating this large breed adult lamb rice flavor he s not a big eater but he loves this food will definitely keep him and all future pets on this brand as long as they keep their standards as high as they are now kudos diamond for making a wonderful natural dog food side note i would never buy regular diamond brand food if the bag doesn t say natural on it the standards they are kept to are way lower and the quality suffers immensely stick with natural it s a couple dollars more at most and your dog will be happier and healthier and live a longer life isn t that what we all want
positive,28/6/20,these are better than the usual canned fish filets tastier and not dry there are no bones or skins i worried about mackerel but they are much nicer than say kippered herring filets or sardines in oil it s easy to pour off the olive oil if that is a worry but you d be losing something that is also tasty
positive,8/8/20,ordered cases on different dates and got them within days cannot find these in the stores so please keep them in stock make for a great meal with some veggies or a salad and this type of fish with omega s is good for you
positive,20/11/19,month old loves to eat them on the go they seem great for a healthy quick and easy snack
positive,5/5/21,slightly crumbly but overall a very good cookie in my opinion very similar to chips ahoy but more airy less dense
positive,2/12/20,this sauce is very good on anything you cook or grill or you can use it as a dip for veggies etc it has just enough heat to make everything taste better
positive,20/11/19,i had brought this as a dipping sauce for dumplings and egg rolls i made at home it taste s great and i think it the same sauce i get at some thai places because it tastes the exact same
positive,9/10/21,several gevalia brand coffee s have been among my favorites for years velvet noir signature blend traditional roast etc the breakfast blend is my go to every day grind it s got a perfect blend of bold rich taste terrific aroma and full taste with very low acidity and harshness just incredible coffee
positive,6/3/21,these chews are tasty and chewy the price is excellent for what you get we have plenty around for ourselves and to share with family great treat for little kids plus they are good for you with no added junk just licorice great buy great taste
positive,12/2/21,for those of you who like love black licorice i seriously recommend this product i eat it because i love black licorice and only recently found that what i have observed is now reported by nuitionists as well these is evidence that black licorice is an aid to those with constipation it comes in other flavors too but the medicinal effects only come the black
positive,2/12/20,this is excellent green tea it is just a little spicy and very flavorful green tea is so good for you you won t even miss your morning coffee and you are helping children when you buy tea district children s tribute tea
positive,20/11/19,the content has been consistantly good the calamares have been tasty the price was also very reasonable
positive,25/6/21,at my local costco store i bought pace salsa numerous times the salsa tastes feel rich and i love the jalepenos pace puts in the salsa spicy but not too the point where i m sweating and can t enjoy my salsa and chips the salsa doesn t feel watered down and this is a great go to salsa choice
positive,17/3/20,water based sardines without salt is awwfuul not bad of a product here far superior to the types i normally purchase at stores
positive,20/10/21,i m on a very low sodium intake mgs per day and these are great good taste and low sodium i just put a little mustard on them and yum
positive,21/7/20,i found out about these from a co worker they are delicious low calorie and pack some protein eating these rather than my usual pretzels and chips helped me slim down i get them by the case now from amazon since it is a better buy and my supermarket doesn t always carry them
positive,22/2/21,i ve been gluten free for a little over a year and i ve struggled with finding tasty and affordable alternatives to my favorite foods the great thing about this mix is that it s really easy to make affordable and the pancakes are so tasty my children do not object to eating them saving me the time of making two batches of pancakes if they didn t see me eating them i don t even think my kids would notice that they are eating gluten free pancakes
positive,8/6/21,it s great i actually used this to make gf donuts the other day i love how convenient it is it s so hard being gluten free so this is god sent for how many things you can make with this i have celiacs and i haven t had any sort of negative reaction to this i would definitely recommend this for anyone who can t have gluten but still wants things like pancakes and waffles and donuts and other fun things
positive,2/12/20,if you only knew bisquick gluten free gf is by far one of the best options out there for people with celiac or sensitivity to gluten i honestly don t know how healthy it is for you what i do know it that it is a great option for people trying to eat as normal as possible this gf option has been a great meal saver for my wife who this last year was diagnosed with celiac and got sick in tired of tasting gross tasting gf options or super simple meat and vegetables options for meals we have made all types of breakfast items biscuits even fried food chicken tenders mozzarella sticks fried fruit we bout our own little frier http www amazon com dp b nq q ref as li ss til tag talkinhome camp creative linkcode as creativeasin b nq q adid xk hzpjrkaed hewp in short it has not only been a great option but also has been quite tasty allowing my wife to make one meal for both of us not worrying that it will taste bad to me hope this was helpful
positive,20/11/19,neither myself nor my husband can have any type of corn products but we love cornbread this mix makes biscuits that taste just like corn bread to us nice to find an alternative that tastes so great appreciate having this order size option as well since it s often missing from grocery store shelves
positive,25/1/21,finally a great and easy gf option for pancakes waffles biscuits etc from bisquick both of my kids have celiac and absolutley love this stuff wish the container was bigger but we re just happy to have better tasting options for breakfast now thank you thank you thank you can t taste a difference but the rest of the family uses the cheaper stuff
positive,1/7/21,gluten free goes mainstream with the addition of gluten free bisquick general mills does a good job making the gluten free version of their famous brand are you gluten free do you know someone that is an estimated million americans are affected by gluten the protein found in wheat barley and rye grains and most do not even know it gluten is a toxin for many especially those with celiac disease autism diabetes multiple sclerosis crohn s disease and a host of other gluten intolerant and gluten sensitivity issues it is quite challenging for those following a gluten free diet to find and afford products that are gluten free wheat is one of the most prevalent ingredients in the american diet find the best tasting gluten free foods at exclusively we have been serving the gluten free community for over years
positive,30/9/20,my family loves bisquick pancakes my kids did not notice the difference from this product and regular pancakes the only problem is the price i will try pamelas this week price seems more reasonable
positive,15/3/20,our family has been wheat free for years and gluten free for so we ve tried just about every mix out there i just found that bisquick has a gf mix while in the grocery store and decided to give it a try this is definitely the best mix that we have ever tasted smooth not grainy i don t know that side by side with regular wheat pancakes that you would notice the difference
positive,6/7/21,i have been gf for the past year and have tried all sorts of flour alternatives this one is certainly the best and the best part about it is you can substitute it for any creation that calls for original bisquick the best so far is the waffles that you can make following the directions on the back i will be ordering again my only complaint is that the boxes are small compared to the other boxes of bisquick available on the shelves
positive,29/6/21,can as be used to make cookies even egg free i just used the mix enough apple sauce to make a batter some coconut butter and added vanilla and cinnamon and baked turned out soft delicious cookies with only minutes from box to the oven however even wallmart carries this for about one dollar per box less than here
positive,29/6/21,ok i just bought bisquick gf and the first thing i tried to make were the drop biscuits recipe listed on the box these are not the kind that are rolled out cut these are drop biscuits the results were very tasty the taste of this gf bisquick is very much like the original but the taste is not as tart as the original if you want a similar buttermilk taste you will need to use buttermilk instead of milk in the biscuit recipe i noticed something else that was odd and might be a problem for anyone new to cooking it seems that the amount of mix called for is not quite right i read the side of the box and it claims that there are cups of mix in the box servings of cup each the biscuit recipe called for cups of mix i measured heaping teaspoonfuls into a measuring cup and i don t even have a cup of mix left in the bag i know this mix doesn t have wheat flour and maybe that kind of flour measures differently maybe if i dug into the bag with a cup i would have used less but the recipe came out right so there must be a misprint on the box i am assuming i measured properly because i have biscuits that can be dipped in gravy smothered with butter jam or sliced to make those yummy mcdonald s breakfast sandwiches by following the instructions i have a lot of biscuits if you are single or just cooking for two you might want to cut the recipe in half you will still have plenty and you won t go through the box so quickly this mix cost me around and i don t have enough left to make anything else without buying another box which i will because these biscuits are really really good still if you are watching your budget don t prepare more than you need about these biscuits yummy fairly golden because the recipe calls for eggs and they can be sliced with some crumbly edges just like glutenous ones without the eggs you probably won t get the nice eye appealing color even though they are drop biscuits you still have to cut in shortening or margarine if you don t have a cutter you will need to use a long fork that is more difficult so if you are a celiac that has been craving biscuits buy a cutter it will cost you as much as a box of this mix the biscuit recipe also calls for milk so if you want that nice tart taste that is reminiscent of the original bisquick you will need to use buttermilk the mix is made up of rice flour sugar leavening potato starch salt xanthum gum many mixes and goodies made with rice flour taste grainy bisquick has done a fantastic job with the rice flour it is not grainy at all i repeat it is not grainy at all for those of you new to celiac cooking using a starch such as corn potato or tapioca is normal and adds a lightness to the baked item that wouldn t be possible with rice flour alone leavening is simply baking soda or powder and is necessary for rising the sugar and salt are for flavor and consistency and yes they are necessary as for the xanthum gum it is a perfectly natural ingredient and it gives celiac safe baked goods a bit of elasticity acting as a replacement for the gluten you will find xanthum gum in just about every baked goodie made for people with celiac disease can you just make your own mix and spend less money sure but you will have a very difficult time finding rice flour as finely ground as the rice flour that is the predominant and main ingredient in this mix the other recipes listed on the box are for pancakes waffles strawberry shortcakes pizza crust ultimate chicken fingers and oven baked chicken you can find more recipes on their website i recommend this product for the taste i do wish that more mix was in the box for the price
positive,26/7/21,this mix made tasty crispy waffles using a standard waffle iron but the whole box only made waffles this would be a five star product for me if i could get more than one family meal out of it for the price
positive,21/10/21,my son just started the gluten free diet and i have tried some foods out there just seeing what he will eat he loved it i couldn t believe it at first but he kept eating i m really glad that i was able to find something that he loves to eat for breakfast my little girl has starring to eat it to and she says it taste good i buy it every time i run out because i love eating it too
positive,25/10/21,with all natural ingredients and no preservatives all i can say is fantastic there is no expiration date but i would eat this within a week or two faster if it s opened absolutely excellent you can freeze these with no loss of quality don t order if the weather is hot because they ship it in cool bags with cold packs instead of styrofoam with dry ice my orders usually arrive cool but not cold
positive,29/6/21,i gave this as a stocking stuffer to my husband to remind him of our last holiday in beautiful jamaica it has a truly tropical taste that is very unique and yummy
positive,5/7/21,this is such a great product from subtle flavors and aromas for delicate dishes to smokey salts for hearty cooking this is a great product for the chef who loves flavor and experimenting in the kitchen this is such a cool product
positive,17/9/21,i have bought this product before these snacks are crisp and great tasting also low in calories i recommend them highly they are shipped almost instantly and arrive within a few days
positive,31/7/21,this melitta decaf riviera sunset coffee has an excellent taste there is none of the weird aftertaste you get with some other decaf coffees it s a smooth mellow taste even a little sweet and with a hint of cocoa i really enjoyed this the grind is listed as extra fine but i didn t find it particularly fine myself when i grind my own beans i have a finer grind than this but i still expected a stronger taste from the melitta than i would from other store brands however the melitta decaf was actually slightly weaker than other store brands we have tried we like our coffee strong about cup ground coffee for to cups water using measuring cups this ratio was not quite strong enough for me with the melitta but that is easily adjustable the nice thing about the coffee is that even when i made it very strong the smoothness remained i will definitely be trying other types of melitta coffee in the future
positive,18/10/21,wonderful smooth satisfying decaf coffee with a fabulously rich flavor no chemical aftertaste like many decafs i ve tried apparently the swiss water process used to decaffeinate this coffee leaves flavor intact something i ve found terribly disappointing in other brands i ve been very impressed by the flavor dimensions of this riviera sunset blend served it to some neighbors who simply won t touch decaf coffee who were pleasantly surprised to find they actually enjoyed a cup of decaf no bitter notes my husband who usually complains fervently about the flavor of decaf has been asking for a cup of this every evening after dinner believe me this alone is quite an endorsement i love using my zojirushi cd wbc micom electric liter water boiler and warmer champagne gold for coffee tea and cooking i brew my coffee a cup at a time with an individual melitta brown paper filter melitta cone coffee filters natural brown no count filters pack of and filter cone similar to this one ready set joe mug and found that the extra fine grind of the riviera sunset blend imparted an unusually rich deliciously multidimensional flavor much fresher than conventional by the pot coffee this method also allows me to brew strong coffee for me and a milder version for my hubby take time to bloom the grounds first add a little hot water to the fresh coffee grounds moistening completely and then wait about seconds before brewing for best flavor this goes for any coffee melitta s riviera sunset decaf blend is enthusiastically recommended by a coffee snob you ll love it as is no sweeteners or creams needed to disguise this wonderful flavor i look forward to ordering more update just ordered my first pack through subscribe save great deal for some delicious decaf
positive,29/6/21,disclaimer i m a coffee addict i m also a starbucks addict so i ve become a bit snobby about my coffee preferences and can t stand the economy stuff i ve had regular melitta coffee before and was favorably impressed by it so i decided to give the decaf version a try especially when the weather gets cold i like a nice hot cup of coffee in the evenings and don t particular want to be tossing and turning hours later the riviera sunset decaf coffee is an excellent decaf for those times you don t want the real thing it had a nice rich flavor with no bitter aftertaste while i continue to prefer the real thing on most occasions i m glad to know there s a good flavorful substitute for when i don t want caffeine
positive,16/9/21,i ve tried to give up my coffee habit but it just hasn t been easy dh and i did manage to switch to decaf a couple years ago so i suppose that s something i m a moderate coffee drinker i like cups of hot joe to get me started in the morning and love a nice chilly iced coffee on a hot afternoon this melitta riviera sunset decaf is smooth and doesn t have the bitter aftertaste that i dislike in one of the leading coffeeshop brands the flavor is great and i ve enjoyed it both hot and iced
positive,24/8/21,this coffee smelled wonderful while it was brewing my husband drinks a lot more coffee than i do and he agreed that this is a great tasting coffee we are looking forward to trying melitta s other varieties
positive,24/6/21,this is the best decaf my family and i have tried in a long time it s smooth not bitter and has enough flavor without being too strong like some other brands i ve tried i like that it s decaffeinated using the natural swiss water process instead of chemicals that s a big plus for me because many brands don t tell you how they decaffeinate their coffee i usually buy whole bean but this ground is so nice and fine and it saves me time having to grind it and get it just right i d suggest following the instructions given on the bag for the best taste seal tightly and store in the refrigerator to keep the flavor this is one i ll be buying again
positive,27/9/21,i have had to cut back on caffeine recently because of heart palpitations that seemed to be made worse by all the coffee i drink cups a day maybe so i am mixing melitta colombian and decaf i substituted this for the other decaf i have been drinking and found that it has a rich smooth taste very little to none of the burnt taste that decaf often has the price on amazon makes it a pretty good buy as well i don t care for the packaging however i couldn t get it open without cutting the top and then i had to transfer it to an old coffee can to store it with all the mess that that entails if it were in a can i would be more inclined to buy it but the taste for a decaf is quite good
positive,29/6/21,hands down by far the absolute worst tasting tea i have ever had and i have allot i am an avid tea drinker and i just can t get it down the benefits are supposed to be amazing so i ll keep it around to water down and sugar up but wow it s bad so strong too tastes like dirt that s been pissed on in the woods
positive,5/8/21,my husband and i both like coffee with rich flavor and good taste but we do not like the bitter or burnt taste some coffees have this community hazelnut has excellent flavor we make it fairly strong and are very pleased with this coffee
positive,29/6/21,the sinus buster tea had an interesting aroma when seeping it s taste is acquired not offense at least to say more like burnt bark or really overheated coffee i had no drainage of my sinuses while drinking one cup of the tea the next morning i could feel relief of pressure and pain i would prefer this product over any inhaled sinus relief agent as a plus all the ingredients of the tea are on the package in english nothing unknown
positive,11/9/21,my husband has to limit the amount of sugar he takes in and these contain no sugar and they taste great
positive,12/8/21,i had coconut trees growing in my backyard in southeast asia and enjoyed drinking coconut water right from the coconut itself taste nirvana real coconut water with pulp is the closest to the real thing that i ve found
positive,31/7/20,great sauce used in many jamaican restaurants to help with the heat of the jerk seasoning most use walkerwood jerk seasoning to make the jerk and pour this on later on the jerk or the rice
positive,31/7/20,i don t eat chips often but when i do these are some of my favorites they have all the flavor and texture of traditional tortilla chips but it is the subtle lime flavoring that makes them special the lime flavoring appears to be a seasoning that has been dusted on some chips seem to have barely any flavor and i find myself looking for those with the most still none of them have quite enough for my tastes i wish that these chips had more that just a hint of lime
positive,13/6/20,i ve tried tons of gf pancake mixes i could choke on most of them or just decide not to ever eat pancakes again these are so moist and delicious my year old grandmother was just diagnosed with celiac disease she loves them too my wife and children who are not gf also love them m
positive,26/9/20,i was expecting hard tasteless healthy cookies it is soft a little chewy and yummy very tasty
positive,17/10/20,these are excellent they taste great and are just the right size two can make an on the go breakfast that is tasty and good for you the larger size breakfast cookies are just too big of these are perfect my husband had gotten out of the habit of eating breakfast too much trouble but since i bought these he is good about grabbing one or two on the way out the door
positive,14/12/20,i think this is a really good deal i seal it up in a rubbermaid container and just scoop it out to brew good stuff
positive,29/5/20,i normally purchase already grown containers of cat grass at my local pet store however the last few pots developed bugs in them which just wasn t sanitary i bought these seeds from hirts and they grew insanely fast my cats love the taste i ve already bought another pack so i can re plant once the cats finish off this batch
positive,9/12/20,i love these they really taste like a soft pb j sandwich and you can bring them anywhere kids would love them too i hope they re available again soon because i m running low
positive,4/8/20,since republic of tea discontinued their bing cherry vanilla tea i was looking for a replacement the flavor of this tea is very different from republics it s better the smell is very rich like toasted vanilla and cherry it almost has a coffee smell but not quite i don t like coffee but this tea is incredible glad i found it best of all the price
positive,31/7/20,this coffee was delicious i actually purchased it as a gift but since i paid for lb of coffee i tasted the freakin coffee it was so good i meant to purchase the light roast but accidentally ordered the medium it was full bodied and delicious totally lacking the high acidity that you find with most commercial coffees i can t afford pure kona all the time and normally buy blends but this coffee is the delicious gourmet coffee you need to buy and keep for company or to treat yourself now and then
positive,13/6/20,key lime pie is one of my all time favorite desserts when i heard about this gum i was definitely a skeptic i figured it d taste more like just a standard citrus y mint gum i was wrong this definitely tastes like real key lime pie filling actual key lime flavor with a milk sweet taste that s not too overpowering the flavor actually lasts for quite a while too though it s much more powerful within the first minutes try it
positive,21/11/20,i loved the flavor and the fact that it was so long lasting everyone in the office eats it now we only eat half a stick so we are not sitting around with a big wad of gum in our cheeks but so far i have not been able to outchew this gum for flavor if you like a bright citrus y taste that is not too overpowering you will love this if you like a more minty gum then go for the mint chocolate chip flavor of this gum
positive,25/5/21,like other reviewers i had low expectations for this gum but was happily wrong i love key lime pie and lime flavor in general when first chewed this gum has the tangy bite of key lime with a creamy sweetness and a hint of graham cracker crust flavor after the initial flavor burst fades there is that surge of artificial sugary sweetness that occurs with some brands flavors of sugarfree chewing gum but the surge isn t as overwhelming or long lasting as it is with some sugarfree gums once that fades the gum has a mellow subtle lime zest flavor i really like this gum
positive,25/5/21,i just like all the other reviewers love this seasoning i have been making cajun catfish with this seasoning for about years i have tried other seasonings when this one was not available but it s just not the same if you want to try my recipe it s very easy i melt butter and brush the catfish fillet with it and generously coat the fish with the seasoning meanwhile i preheat a cast iron skillet when the skillet is hot i put in about tbs olive oil and than about tbs of butter and fry the fish to a golden to dark brown on each side about minutes and add some more butter if the pan becomes to dry after turning the fish during this i make a pot of spaghetti my wife likes angle hair after the pasta is done drain it and remove the fish to a platter turn off the heat under the skillet add a little more olive oil and butter scrape up the bits of fish left on the bottom of the skillet and dump the pasta into the skillet and mix it around to soak up the buttery oil than sprinkle some more seasoning on the pasta and serve with the fish everyone love it to give this dish a little color you can add a bag of fresh spinach to the pasta water during the last minutes of cooking or stir in a small can of diced cajun tomatoes after you put the pasta in the skillet or use both hope you enjoy it if you try it
positive,20/1/21,i have been using this spice mix for many years but i have found it hard to find lately i decided i would check amazon and i was very surprised to see it available i am a fairly good cook and i have developed some easy dishes using this mix and it is very unusual and tasty a pack is a lot of this spice but it does keep for years and i use it quite often give your family the kick it deserves with luzianne cajun seasoning
positive,8/2/21,i bought this for my month old grandson to try he loves it i m so pleased that i am ordering it for my infant great niece and also for part of an all organic baby shower gift this food is inexpensive convenient and organic best of all he likes it i m setting up the recurring delivery method for my grandson correction the product i ordered two weeks ago was a case now the cost is that s quite a price hike is there any way to be notified if the price goes back down
positive,10/2/21,liked the baby food yes for myself p really tasty and smooth consistency for an organic treat except the peaches and apricots not soo much nice flavor and such really good though and timely shipping excellent buyer
positive,9/10/20,this is the best tasting brown rice i have ever had kind of a nutty flavor this is the only rice i have ever had that tastes great all by itself
positive,31/7/20,here is a great way to get that tast of your childhood without all the sugar even without blood sugar problems i want to cut back on any excess sugar this allows you to have a drink option other than water with a perky taste that is low calorie and sugar free parents do not tell the kids and just serve it they will never know the diffrence its that good
positive,13/6/20,i ve been searching for alternatives for high calorie high sugar drinks after tasting many different products this one is my favorite by a long shot i can t believe it has no sugar at all the little packets make a nice quantity of the beverage some of the other brands i have tried gave me heartburn or they weren t sweet enough this one is perfect i tried the cherry flavor also which is good but not as good as the tropical you have to be careful with spilling it because it does tend to stain but any traditional stain remover did just fine at preventing the stains from setting in to carpet clothes and countertops ditch the sugary alternatives and you can save hundereds of calories per day just by using this instead cutting calories just became a lot more easy edit i still use this product multiple times a day it s great to have a premixed drink in the fridge that you can go to that tastes great and you don t have to worry about calorie intake or getting the kids all hyped up from sugars i also took packets on vacation and mixed it on site saved time and money instead of stocking a fridge up when you would just have to throw away the unused portion at the end of the trip i just wish they made a orange and maybe a berry flavor as well
positive,5/12/20,the tropical punch flavor tastes just like i remember as a kid easy to use and fully dissolves in cold water although i ll use a chopstick or knife to stir the mix while the water is filling
positive,1/11/20,i have been having blood sugar and yeast issues and i ve had to cut out sugar i had never tried sugar free kool aid before so i was a bit nervous about this one luckily i found the taste to be really good even my picky kids love it i love the fact that these come pre sweetened in individual pouches you just tear one open and stir it into quarts of water it couldn t be faster or easier it even dissolves well in cold water i just ordered a case of the cherry flavor too my kids and i can t get enough of the tropical punch flavor so we re excited to try cherry too
positive,23/1/21,i got a case of yuban cans from amazon for an amazing price and now that i ve been reintroduced to yuban i m sticking with it it s colombian which is the coffee i prefer anyway but yuban must have a special formula for roasting and grinding that results in such excellent coffee cans have the foil seals that you can peel off so you don t need to use a can opener and of course plastic lids to reseal sniffing this coffee as i scoop it into my coffee maker is half the delight just so excellent and suits my tastes perfectly buying the case is very convenient too
positive,31/7/20,and a great price from amazon my wife and i had dinner last night at a very high end restaurant and while everything was magnificent we both thought the coffee wasn t as good as our yuban i often wonder about starbucks whose coffee i find undrinkable my son says it s an acquired taste
positive,13/6/20,bought these at a local store due to the great ingredients with none of the bad chemicals and have been waiting for them to be in stock here i ll definitely buy more when they are available as they are the best shortbread cookies i ve ever had my son agrees and i love that they re basically as good as you could get if you made them yourself with ingredients you can pronounce and won t kill you so delicious
positive,1/12/20,i buy these at a local grocery store not from amazon com they are absolutely lovely light and crisp they re like naked cheetos that are actually fairly healthy they can be topped with most anything sweet or savory great for midnight snacks afternoon snacks or crumbled up in tomato soup at lunch or dinner wish they d make them in flavors they d beat the pants off most diet snacks i ve ever seen
positive,30/1/21,since i am counting calories i find wasa crisp n light very tasty you can eat three of them and feel like you are eating a lot more than you really are i think the taste is great and have told all my friends about them
positive,11/1/21,my wife always made her own gravy from scratch and is good at it however this gravy is fantastic idiot proof even i can make it and reminds me of my grandma s cooking my wife loves it and this will definitely be a new staple for our cupboard
positive,31/7/20,awesome tasting tea in a oz can i highly recommend this product because it taste great and doesn t cost a lot
positive,13/6/20,i make an extended butter using this oil water and liquid lecithin it is just the best tasting spread ever and much healthier because of the walnut oil i keep mine refrigerated to preserve that wonderful taste and aroma it tends to settle out so be sure to shake it before using to get the full flavor and consistency i didn t know to do this on the first container and when i got to the bottom it was very thick almost sludgy with the roasted bits amazon s price is pretty fair although i can occasionally find it locally tj maxx a bit cheaper but i must say ordering from amazon and getting it shipped straight to me is very convenient i ve never had any problems with damaged or leaking containers on this product well maybe a small dent in the metal but that s all
positive,14/1/21,so happy i got this on a subscription i might even have to increase the frequency that it is delivered i ve used it in everything from scrambled eggs to brownies it s not mild like olive oil but it has enhanced the flavor of everything i ve cooked
positive,7/12/20,this oil has a wonderful mild roasted walnut flavor that i found irresistible in a salad dressing it will now be my go to oil for homemade dressings there is a recipe for vinaigrette right on the back of the can bought it because it s omega content is second only to flaxseed oil plus it s made in california definitely buy it on amazon so much cheaper than the grocery store
positive,5/5/21,the first moment you bite into this cracker you will notice the difference this tasty crunchy organic cracker is perfect with soup or salad it is certified organic using quality ingredients the cracker is dry not greasy or oily like a typical potato chip comes in several different varieties and flavors recommended
positive,23/11/20,this is a terrific baby food it has beef and spinach and tastes great it was the first meat baby food my son would eat i tasted it myself and it s quite good
positive,29/8/20,my daughter loves this she is picky so she doesn t always eat as many healthy foods as she should this flavor gives her the vegetables and protein that she needs it is a little bit grainier than other stage foods but still very usable for babies over months
positive,18/1/21,we live in the middle of nowhere so we end up ordering a lot of spices etc that can t be found locally this gives great chipotle taste with just a little sprinkled on i m going to order a few more of these because i never want to run out of it
positive,7/7/21,okay so let me preface my review by saying that i don t drink hot chocolate that often and i m from america and don t think i ve ever had hot chocolate while traveling in europe but my husband is a british citizen who grew up in india with summers in england and he has searched high and low for a chocolate drink that would remind him of those from his childhood we found it in this drink and he will not drink any other chocolate drink now not even the other kinds that are in my pantry that i bought for him to try and after cup he turned his nose up at them men
positive,7/7/21,very good lemonade mix close to fresh in taste love that it has stevia i like it so much more than crystal light or any of the other mixes with artificial sweeteners i can take it anywhere mix it in bottled water and have a refreshing healthy safe cool drink
positive,1/7/21,my wife has a difficult time getting enough iron and supplements are very hard on her stomach with of the usrda of iron in one serving of this blackstrap molasses she can very easily get the iron she needs this is not in any way hard on her stomach either it tastes very good compared to other blackstraps we tried a few have a slight edge on taste but none on iron content blackstrap is an acquired taste but worth it for natural nutrients this definitely picked up her step within a very short time she gets low energy and tired when she needs iron we will definitely be buying this again
positive,7/7/21,wow this tastes great sweet and chocolaty like a liquid chocolate bar plus it is organic it does contain high glycemic cane juice so i don t drink too much the original and vanilla flavors are sweetened with low glycemic rice syrup they have less sugar all are organic i don t know why the ingredients here say canola oil neither the good karma website nor the label on the box has that ingredient if i verified that this site is correct and the good karma corporate website and the label on the carton are wrong i would stop using the product perhaps this page has outdated ingredient information this is the richest most milk like rice beverage and the label on it does not mention canola oil which contains up to toxic erucic acid and is found in many rice beverages that are fed to children canola oil cannot be used by us fda regulation in infant food one research paper found higher levels of erucic acid in red blood cells of autistic children compared to non autistic children and there are many other well established toxic effects of erucic acid in humans and animals look in the medical journals this product is sold in my neighborhood ralph s best price vc discount and whole foods in los angeles the brand whole foods own brand is also canola free it is much cheaper but watery in comparison i use it for cooking only plain and vanilla flavors though west soy rice beverage is also canola free it has a more neutral taste and less body they have a chocolate flavor many people find rice milk better tasting than other milk substitutes i find it to be much easier to digest than soy and nut products soy milk however has much more protein aside from being hard to digest i don t eat too much soy because of the anti nutritional components so i get my protein elsewhere
positive,23/7/21,i ve tried a bunch of them and the taste of this product is outstanding even the folks behind the counter at my gym commented on it and they sell a competing product give it a try you won t be disappointed
positive,20/7/21,great meal replacement drink that tastes great you get plenty of protein and other vital nutrients i prepare one of these whenever i m on the go and i won t have to worry about missing a meal the best bang for your buck especially if you subscribe to the amazon subscribe and save program
positive,19/7/21,listen if you want a good taste and hot this the stuff it won t melt your eyes out but it is too hot to take straight one dab will do ya on a bite of pizza
positive,18/6/21,if you are the kind of guy who really enjoys a huge slab of bacon with your breakfast not that wimpy kind of stuff they serve at a restaurant but the kind that hunters grab when they are together thick with lots of fat in the middle you will enjoy these you can almost feel your cholesterol count go up as you bite into them now i must admit i am a wimpy crispy kind of gal and i like my bacon on the lean side in fact with my allergies i have to use morningstar soy bacon don t cringe so when i bit into these i realized from the very first bite i was not their intended audience nope these are not girl food they are man food if you want to carry a bag of these out to serve to your fishing or hunting buds early in the morning this is the perfect selection for you however you might want to consider the david s signature beyond gourmet jelly beans man mix for a selection or the milder and tamer david s signature beyond gourmet jelly beans flavor sampler both will give you a variety to try just in case you don t like bacon as much as you think you do i am grateful to have received samples of all of these from the company to try and am basing my review on the samples which they sent oh i passed the rest of my bacon ones on to my guy buddies
positive,7/7/21,this is a very tasty product this is my first time trying this and i am glad i ordered it to see how it tastes as a product i d order it again one odd thing though that will because me to lower this rating from stars to is that the listing here says a pound but on the label ounces is crossed out and ounces is written next to it i didn t weigh the container to confirm this but if it is ounces then then they need to update their listing to show such since i consider shipping to not be part of a product review i won t lower my star rating for this and consider this to be just a mention of this then but the shipping was slow i ordered it on june th a usps tracking delivery confirmation number was generated on the st to be fair but it took until july th for me to get this even taking into account that there was a major holiday july th that just seems too slow everything was packaged well enough although without anything like a blue ice pack to keep it cold for summer shipping but just took a long time to get here i do suspect the order wasn t truly shipped until the week before the july th weekend despite a tracking number being generated on june st
positive,21/7/21,i grew up in southern california so i ve had my share of sweet corn cakes at local restaurants this mix is a great way to make these at home i prepared a package of these for a friend of mine who lives on the east coast and had never tried a corn cake she s now addicted but can t find them at her local store thank goodness for amazon
positive,18/6/21,over the past two years thanks to amazon i have been sampling jerky from literally all over the you s i finally found a tasty jerky that doesn t give my jawbone a workout great meat flavor an excellent snack
positive,30/6/21,i bought this product because it looked good not knowing if it would taste as good as it looked well it finally showed up by usps well packaged it s soft smells great and tastes even better you won t be disappointed i ve already eaten five strips
positive,1/7/21,i just love skittles for a while we had them here in brazil south america but then for some reason i couldn t find them anymore so when my aunt is coming down for a visit i ask her to bring me some this time i decided to spare her the shopping trouble and i bought it through amazon and had it sent to her place the bag was a bit larger than i expected but i guess this was a good thing right
positive,24/8/21,i ordered these because i could not seem to find this size at the store there were a couple skittle shells at the bottom of the bag from the shipping of the product but everything else was fine
positive,21/7/21,i actually tasted the berry vanilla flavor if you ve ever eaten a fig newton then try to imagine a fig newton minus the fig center with rice crispies mixed up in it it tastes a little grainy at first but once i read the ingredients and realized that the grains were puffed rice i was more at ease really a good taste one of the better gluten free casien free egg free cookies i ve eaten
positive,13/9/21,no matter how wholesome a snack may be it s worthless unless the girls approve in this case they both give the science diet jerky treats two paws up i like that beef is the first ingredient in the recipe and there are none of those unrecognizable ingredients created in a science laboratory the treats are a nice size and have just enough chew to satisfy for piper our shih tzu with a few missing teeth i break the treats into smaller pieces so she can manage them on the package use within weeks of opening satisfaction guaranteed keep this bag out of the reach of pets and children
positive,18/6/21,i was amazed at the actual taste of this product the amount of protein and the lack of fat is really good they have a lot more flavors and all of the combinations are really good
positive,7/7/21,great taste there is a slight bitterness to this tea but it s black tea it s bound to be a little bitter especially for being so strong the strength is perfect for customizing to taste some people like strong tea while others like theirs very mild so you can add more water if you want i like to make a fairly strong tea the melting ice dilutes it just fine and sweeten it myself i like sweet tea but usually when i get it it just tastes like sugar water these give me the strong tea flavor i love and i can add the perfect amount of sweetness great product
positive,15/7/21,i ordered this assorted bartons turkish delight in it is delicious i took it to my parents house for my sister s birthday among her gifts which i also bought at amazon everyone at the party loved this turkish delight so much they even wanted to buy it for them and i told them amazon go there they have everything amazon thank you as allways bringing us international flavors without leaving our homes
positive,11/7/21,i ordered these to use for marathon training i have a sensitive stomach but have had no problems with these they do give me energy during those long runs
positive,7/10/21,i tasted a few of these and they are pretty good i was expecting something a bit flavorless and i can imagine happily snacking on these for a multi day packing hike i will write more after i have taken them on the trail
positive,6/7/21,stingers are better tasting and more convenient than gels and work just as well to provide energy when exercising over long periods of time
positive,18/6/21,i was excited to try these little honey chews to help with my energy levels during exercising and running i am years old and about pounds overweight i find it hard to keep my energy up day after day while running and exercising first of all these are so tasty without being overly sugary i was surprised though to see that the ingredients weren t mostly honey and the first ingredient listed which is suppose to be what the item has the most of is tapioca syrup i guess with the package calling it honey stinger i was thinking that it was pure honey with some taste enhancers still everything is organic which i suppose should add to it s value i found that i felt no energy boost during my activities but i can say that without a doubt that these make you feel like you can keep going and going it s not something that feels like you are really energetic but more like you just got a good days rest and are ready to get going i don t like feeling like i m on a sugar high with that nervous feeling in my chest and these do not do that i think they make you feel healthy and are a good addition to your diet for exercising the only drawback to me is the cost of these for bags makes it hard to justify the purchase as often as you would like to have them i will purchase again when my grocery money allows i would recommend to buy if you are looking for a healthy pickup to keep you going all day and not just for a quick boost
positive,7/7/21,i didn t want caffeine don t want the high calories went through many types of energy chews gels drinks online to see what would be the best option for myself i love the honey stingers no caffeine calories can be controlled depending on how many pieces you take and most importantly it lasted me through my marathon trainings fruit smoothy is delicious haven t tried the other flavors
positive,27/7/21,this tastes great and i like that it s more natural than most other sodas available basically it s a carbonated juice i generally prefer a larger oz size though
positive,13/7/21,i like the taste of this drink in many ways it takes me back to my childhood with the orange ice lollies i used to eat as it has a similar flavour the thing you should be aware of is that although it has no added sugar because it has so much fruit juice it does have a lot of calories i also found that the can needed to be bigger as i wanted more at the end
positive,13/9/21,i put my orange switch in the refrigerator overnight to make it nice and cold and i had it with breakfast i love the taste of it mostly orange with a hint of carbonation it tastes sweet naturally and i m sure it s good for you i would buy this product
positive,7/9/21,this is a very refreshing carbonated juice drink with no aftertaste i love the flavor and the fact that there is no added sugar it s more subtle than orange so really kills a thirst the size is perfect for times when you don t really want a ounce drink
positive,17/4/21,i really like this drink my only complaint is that i d need to drink cans at a time oz is a wee bit on the petite side for me if it came in a oz can i d be much more likely to buy it and the packaging would be much less costly really tasty product though and i ve got no quarrels with the ingredients yum
positive,10/3/21,this is almost the kind of fruit soda i d make if i were going into this business the difference is that i d go the odwalla route and not use reconstituted juice concentrate and only use orange tangerine juices since it s a carbonated beverage i d probably use a stabilizer too so it wouldn t have to be shaken before drinking that would result in a higher price though not sure how much higher than the almost can price it s being offered as a grocery item imagine the price in a vending machine for this product the first ingredient is apple juice and the second is grape juice then comes the tangerine and orange juice and finally acerola juice a fruit high in vitamin c and apparently popular in puerto rico and barbados there s acacia gum as a stabilizer probably don t want to have to shake a carbonated drink and then additional natural colors and flavors ascorbic acid and soy my yo daughter and i shared a can and liked the taste on a par with orangina my personal preference would be for a little more carbonation but this was ok i m a traditionalist so i definitely prefer a oz can the quantity at this price makes me feel a little ripped but then i prefer to make my own lemonade in the blender adding in some raspberries or strawberries or mint to vary the flavor cheers
positive,21/1/21,i don t know how to describe switch orange tangerine without sounding like a cliche advertising slogan but the truth is it really is very refreshing just the right amount of carbonation too this stuff tastes like what you would get if you squeezed part tangerine and part orange and then poured in a bit of sparkling soda very fresh tasting not too sweet at all the label says there is no sugar added fine as it does not need any the label also says it has apple and grape juice i taste mostly the tangerine myself but you may find your mileage varies finally it is supposed to give you a full days worth of vitamin c ok a lot of drinks can do that nowdays but without any refined sugar of high fructose corn syrup or artificial sweetener i could totally see replacing my orange soda with this stuff i have not seen this in the market yet but i would be willing to try other flavors and add switch to the many beverages i enjoy really for a fruit drink it is pretty darn good
positive,30/1/21,there s nothing wrong with this drink but it really just tastes like any other orange soda kudos to the switch for not adding artificial flavors sugar or corn syrup though it tastes pretty clean and refreshing but a bit expensive for what it is don t let the small sized can oz fool you this isn t an energy drink it s just an orange soda
positive,15/1/21,if you re a regular drinker of orange soda pop you might like this switch orange tangerine carbonated juice beverage i thought the flavor was very good and appreciated that it was only mildly carbonated not so fizzy that i had gas after drinking it at calories per small serving however this isn t something i would regularly drink it s much healthier to eat whole fruit since it s more filling that simply drinking the extracted juice in part because of the fiber associated with eating whole foods still this is a healthier option for those who regularly drink sugared sodas
positive,6/3/21,this is a wonderfully refreshing citrus drink not too sweet or too sour just enough bubbles to make it sparkle i would imagine it could make a great addition to a punch if you chose to add it to your favorite fruit juice the only draw back for me is that it is a tad bit too expencive to replace our families normal beverage of choice but it sure does make a terrific treat to keep around for an occational indulgence
positive,8/6/21,i enjoyed the flavor of this orange soda it was not overly sweet and the orange flavor had just enough tartness to it i am glad it does not have any hfcs in it but the calorie count is still quite high from the natural sugars all in all if you are looking for a good orange soda try this one
positive,10/3/21,i really liked the tatste of this it actually tastes like you re getting the juice from a tangerine i think the carbonation gives it that zing taste you can only get biting into an tangerine orange etc my daughter however really didn t like it not sweet enough for her i think it s a little pricey not sure i d be willing to plunk down that much for it the can is very small fl ozs which is a proper serving of orange juice which makes it around a can or a little less but overall i truly enjoyed that zinging tangerine taste
positive,24/5/21,this relatively expensive convenience packaged item is percent juice and contains calories worth of concentrated apple grape tangerine orange and acerola juice reconstituted with carbonated water acacia gum some soy and added vitamin c to provide percent of the adult minimum daily requirement there are no artificial flavors or additives which allows the manufacturer to describe this as a natural beverage i often mix juice with seltzer water and i like the combination quite cold the switch orange tangerine tasted more like orange soda with a tangerine chaser than what i am used to as juice flavor the carbonation makes the drink seem lighter than juice but not as light and refreshing to the mouth as juice and seltzer the tangerine flavor made the taste seem more appealing than orange soda but the orange and tangerine flavors don t last as long as soda flavors do on the palate i would drink this again on a hot day if i could buy it inexpensively enough
positive,29/3/21,the can size is like a redbull drink s however its sugar content is grams attached is a photo of the nutrional facts in terms of its taste in my opinion it s quite tasty sweet a bit tangy and very orangish
positive,10/3/21,i like orange soda but usually cannot drink an entire can or bottle of sunkist or orange crush case pk because they are so sickly sweet this has just the right touch of natural sweetness and the tangerine gives a nice little tang to the orange flavor reminds me of the great orange sodas you can get in europe or specialty shops like orangina sparkling citrus beverage with natural pulp cans or san pellegrino aranciata pack oz bottles dare i say it yes the flavor and size make it a perfect mixer after my intial sip i immediately thought it would be great to fill up the rest of the glass with vodka
positive,27/1/21,if you want a quick pick me up that is not full of added sugar then this is a refreshing alternative to a soda the flavor is more heavily tangerine which only makes sense it isn t overly sweet which is a good thing
positive,1/6/21,i sampled a can of switch orange tangerine and found it to be a tasty beverage as advertised it is a balance between juice and carbonated with a light carbonation so it doesn t taste like orange crush or fanta but not like orange gatorade either the oz can has calories with a dv carb sugar content but vitamin c and vit a it s marketed as juice coming mostly from filtered concentrates no sugar added no corn syrup no preservatives no artificial colors gluten free if you re concerned with all that most important is that it tastes good and i would try it again
positive,20/8/21,i ll admit that i don t care for drinks that are carbonated the carbonation in soda makes me burp they tend to be too sweet or the diet drinks have a weird taste to them so i wasn t sure what to expect when i drank this to my surprise the carbonation is very mild it s more like a light buzz in your mouth instead of a lot of carbonation you won t hear the contents fizz when you drink this stuff the orange tangerine flavor is a nice combo stronger in the tangerine flavor than orange though as someone who doesn t like any sugar in my drinks i found it to be a tad sweet though it is advertised as no sugar added but less than i expected i m not sure when you would drink this though it s a small can and i can t imagine someone who drinks cans of soda drinking one of these instead especially at the price they charge for this are they thinking that this will replace a glass of orange juice first thing in the morning overall i think it s tasty and if someone offered me one i d take it but it s not something i would buy
positive,14/8/21,this is a mix of apple grape tangerine orange and acerola juices taste is obviously subjective and that can be seen in the reviews i like the flavor but will try to describe it rather than raving or ranting about it the tangerine is the dominant flavor however it is the taste of a very ripe tangerine or perhaps a clementine there is that slight alcohol or medicinal overtone to an otherwise good flavor i could see people not liking it while other do each can has grams of sugar vitamin c and vitamin a and not much else these aren t nutrients that are otherwise hard to get so this isn t necessarily a healthy alternative to regular soda on some level e g producing fruit instead of sugar cane it might be attractive to some
positive,21/4/21,as part of amazon s vine program i received two trial cans of the switch black cherry and orange tangerine i tried both flavors cold over ice and rated them stars each although i prefer the orange tangerine flavor to the black cherry whether or not the switch is just right or not sweet enough for you will depend on your personal experience with carbonated juice drinks and soda if you are looking for the sweetness and fizz of a diet soda you will be disappointed these are juice drinks the orange tangerine flavor has calories and the black cherry has calories i recommend them as an alternative to regular juice to liven up your lunch or help you refuel after a workout either way you are getting of your vitamin c and there s no added sugar or corn syrup no preservatives and no artifical colors the black cherry flavor was too mild for me i was looking for more bite i could taste hints of the apple grape and acerola juice concentrates in the blend the flavor reminded me of blends i ve tasted from treetop again the switch has a lot less carbonation than you would find in izze fortified all natural sparkling blackberry juice for example the orange tangerine flavor should be renamed the tangerine orange flavor to reflect the dominate taste and aroma the switch s blend is as flavorful as essn sparkling minneola tangerine juice or san pellegrino orange although again it is no where near as carbonated as those other brands in summary these all natural juice drinks are a healthier option than drinking a soda the switch also can help break up the monotony of drinking plain water and or juice after a workout remember to keep them the cans ice cold though preferably serve them on the rocks by the way if you are looking for a full flavored black cherry soda try thomas kemper black cherry soda which has calories per bottle there s a low calorie version as well but it isn t available on amazon
positive,1/4/21,i love the taste of this soda it s sweet with no bitter aftertaste that can be found in some orange sodas i d never guess this was a natural drink from the taste alone my only complaint would be the serving size it s correct for a serving size but not what i m used to in a soda can oz
positive,17/4/21,the switch is marketed as of what you want of what you don t meaning the only things in the can are juice and carbonation there is no added sugar no corn syrup high fructose or otherwise no preservatives no artificial colors natural flavors and colors are added and no gluten the orange tangerine flavor seemed to taste almost like carbonated sunny delight according to the label the juice flavors are apple grape tangerine orange and acerola it was quite tasty and had just the right amount of carbonation almost like a soda that has been opened and left to sit for just a few minutes to let some of the excess gas escape it was light and dare i say refreshing for what it is marketed to be it does quite well the only downside is that i could probably do something similar at home buy some sunny d and add some sparkling water or seltzer and it would probably be cheaper however if you re out and about and need something light tasty and not loaded full of extra nonsense then this would certainly fit the bill
positive,22/4/21,i drank this and could tell very little difference from a regular orange tangerine flavored soda which is quite impressive considering that this drink is made from juice it has calories and a great alternative to a regular soda i will definitely be purchasing these in the future i also tried their kiwi strawberry carbonated juice and enjoyed it as well
positive,1/4/21,i realize that it is not quite healthy to guzzle oz canisters of liquid at a sitting but this switch orange tangerine flavored drink was so light and refreshing and tasted so natural that i could easily have downed another oz can or two and that is the only reason this drink did not receive five stars i wanted more and the little can was just not enough it is the perfect size for a child however so perhaps that who the drink is targeted for as an aside for those who prefer their beverages more adult oriented this orange tangerine switch would make an awesome mixer with gin or vodka cheers
positive,30/6/21,i tried the black cherry version and liked it but this one is much better great orange taste plus the benefit of juice and no corn syrup sweetner for those worried about its use the carbonation helps make it a satisfying drink to quench thirst and the knowledge that it is healthy satisfies the mind as well
positive,29/1/21,these oz cans of switch keep their promise there are no added sugar no corn syrup and no preservatives it is a carbonated all natural juice like most of these juices drinks the ingredients state juice in this order filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates apple grape tangerine orange and acerola juice concentrates gum acaia natural flavors and colors ascorbic acid vitamin c and soy i was very surprised that this taste like a great tangerine soda each can has calories orno thanks i am swimming from mg of sodium g of carbohydrates g of sugar and of rda of vitamin c and of vitamin a i would be pleased to drink this sparkling orange tangerine flavored juice again i found it to taste good and be a refreshing drink but for my money i would rather by the izze fortified sparkling juice clementine ounce cans pack of brand of fortified sparkling juice that has a cleaner taste and fewer calories
positive,17/4/21,i m always on the lookout for soda s that are made using real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup and fruit juice instead of chemicals switch s ingredients are filtered water apple grape tangerine orange and acerola juice concentrates gum acacia natural flavors and colors and ascorbic acid vitamin c it also says it contains soy so avoid it if you are allergic to soy one can contains vitamin c and vitamin a it also contains grams of sugar and it tastes like it the taste of switch is very similar to regular orange soda which includes the syrupy taste that orange soda has i personally don t like the syrupy taste and think this is way too sweet i can see kid s liking the taste however and it is a much better alternative to regular orange soda grams of sugar is a lot for ounces of a drink i would avoid it for myself but may use it as an occasional substitute for my kids
positive,30/5/21,this orange tangerine juice bills itself as having of what you want and of what you don t want it is pure orange and tangerine juice with a bit of carbonation but no added sugar preservatives and carbonation of course that s all great but the big question is how it tastes i m pleased to be able to say it tastes pretty good it has a bit less zip than i usually prefer in my orange soda but a nice orange tangerine flavor and no noticeable aftertaste i would definitely try this again if i had the chance
positive,6/5/21,i really enjoyed this drink the tangerine is very present and makes it very tasty this drink is natural and has no sugar added the carbonation makes it a bit like a soda but a lighter and healthier one i enjoyed it and i would definitely recommend it to others as an excellent alternative to regular soda
positive,20/4/21,i m a big fan of avoiding corn syrup and a lot of the other ingredients that go into most processed foods and beverages these days so this beverage idea really sounded good to me it doesn t contain a bunch of artificial junk in it and it still tastes pretty good i could definitely drink more of these they won t ever be my favorite beverage but then i m more of a non carbonated kind of drinker anyway this is definitely a good alternative to other products out there and i d like to try other flavors as well
positive,21/4/21,i wasn t sure what to expect with this but upon tasting it very chilled i have to admit it s pretty darn tasty to give you an idea of what it tastes like take orange juice give it the familiar bite of your favorite carbonated beverage add a little tangerine for a slight citrus aftertaste and there you go basically it looks and smells like orange juice but it tastes like orange pop should taste if it really tasted like oranges my wife said it reminded her of minute maid orange pop or as she would call it orange soda our four year old son is eager to drink pop because he sees mom and dad do it occassionally but we generally don t let him after reading the nutritional information on the can and seeing that there s no added sugar corn syrup preservatives or artificial flavors i can admit that i would have no problem letting him drink this instead of juice occassionally but not too often as it is quite a bit of sugar my wife made the observation that this drink would probably make a fantastic mixer for adult beverages sadly the sample we received was not enough to test this theory but it should make a really really good screwdriver
positive,2/5/21,firstly i hate orange flavored sodas they all taste like ultra fake chemical laden floor cleaner to me switch is definitely not the case finally an orange soda that tastes like real oranges and tangerines who knew i thoroughly enjoyed this fizzy delight which reminded me of san pellegrino aranciata sparking beverage oz cans but sweeter this and all switch beverages are highly recommended
positive,25/5/21,lana s snowflake black tea with coconut and almond has now become my favorite tea first the smoothness is unbeatable i found it a bit smoother than the hanley vanilla cormoro secondly the aroma changes from the time you smell it in the bag and then brew it is a great experience when you taste it you have a wonderful surprise of sweetness and comfort sort of a nutty caramel with vanilla notes it is the perfect dessert tea my husband lost lbs by drinking this instead of having ice cream now when you present it to friends let them taste it first if they go by the intense aroma in the bag it is so fresh some have wrongly thought it was too strong a flavor but it is not it is the amazing freshness they are not used to we served this at our wedding vow renewal and it beat out hanleys vanilla cormoro and paris too this tea has filled a gap i have had in my collection i have searched for a flavor like this over years lana please keep on creating this tea i am definitely coming back for more and thank you for tremendous and fast service by the way i am sipping this as i write yum smiles grace in vt
positive,7/9/21,since swanson s sun butter only contains roasted sunflower seeds and no other ingredients it is the only nut butter product we buy
positive,25/5/21,just received this butter yesterday and we are already using it to make sandwiches with jelly tastes great without having any salt or sugar added highly recommend
positive,22/5/21,this stuff is great i m allergic to peanuts just happened over night and i miss having a pbj so this is the next best thing to it truly this butter is all that and then some
positive,19/7/21,i really like the fruity taste of this tea so much so that i can actually drink it without sugar if you like fruity teas you should try this product
positive,25/8/21,my vodka tonics have never been so refreshing i wish i would have ordered two cases now as my husband and i are going through far too much
positive,6/9/21,this is by far the best tasting thing that s come from a goat in years bullsburg creamery man chowder dairy or goat coat can t hold a candle to this stuff drink it bake it snort it it s all good
positive,25/5/21,chrysanthemum tea taste great with lemons and apriva chrysanthemum tea is caffeine free that s great for pregnant women and those with high blood pressure
positive,7/9/21,for coffee drinkers who buy maxwell house coffee this is a deal buy two cases for just over free shipping too seriously you know i stocked up
positive,13/10/21,great product i purchased this product from our local fresh market i am a vegan and am always looking for different meat substitutes to try i used this mix to make some taco mince this stuff was perfect i even got my non veg father to try a bite of the tacos and he thought they were good as well that right there is saying something because my father is really iffy about mock meats i have another packet in which i am going to cook up today
positive,26/6/21,i love to make sun tea with these tea bags it is very nice on a hot day to sit with a chilled glass it is tasty and not too sweet highly recommended
positive,15/7/21,i went to a gourmet store and asked for their chocolate expert to recommend a chocolate among the high end makers he pointed out this brand which was affordable as well as incredibly flavorful if you need a chocolate to melt in your mouth savor the santander cocoa
positive,27/9/21,as far as noodles in a cup goes this is one of the best i ve had actual recognizable small chunks of dehydrated veggies mostly mushrooms and onions that i could make out descent noodle quality and a very hot and spicy seasoning mix they don t show it on the picture here but i m pretty sure this is the hot and spicy cup it looks exactly like the one i just had but the words hot and spicy are just to the left of the symbol and are not visible in the pic if you like spicy noodles definitely don t pass this up very good
positive,19/6/21,compared to other egg proteins i have recently used this one is very sweet it is sweetened with splenda so still very low in actual sugar carbs i prefer to use an unsweetened version and put fruit in the blender with it to naturally sweeten it but my wife likes this one b c its easy to instantize in milk we use almond milk with a spoon no blender required
positive,25/5/21,i really like this protein drink i m pregnant and trying to increase protein in my diet without adding a whole lot of extra calories or fat this is the perfect solution i usually mix it with a combination of plain almond milk and half water i also usually add a little more liquid than it says in the directions otherwise i find it too sweet the nice thing is that it is sweetened with stevia instead of a calorie filled sugar of some sort i prefer egg protein to other proteins because soy is often gmo and not recommended in high doses in pregnancy or for anyone actually and whey protein is a dairy product which i generally don t tolerate well egg protein is perfect for my needs
positive,7/9/21,i like this product and i agree with any post who says it mixes well i bought a sample case just to test the waters and i do not feel bloated or anything after i drink it i think i feel my body is responding to it very well i am going to finish up the muscle milk protein because i bought it and i pay over for it lol but when i finish up the other proteins i purchase i am going to stick with egg white protein since i do not like eating them everyone taste buds is different some may like it some may do not then depending on your body chemistry some responds well to egg whites some do not but as for me personally i like it so far might try out the strawberry passion protein but the vanilla kind taste very good i would suggest this protein should be used for edurance athletes or people who are into calistenics such as push ups and pull ups
positive,3/8/21,i bought these for my husband because he occassionally likes a cup of coffee at home and it is a hassle to drag out the coffee maker and grinder when he only wants one cup and it s not everyday it also comes in handy when guests come over because we don t tend to keep coffee in the house each serving comes in a little pouch that you can easily slip into your pocket briefcase or travel bag the flavor was rich and at around a cup much cheaper than going to starbucks or anywhere else and grabbing a cup on the way to work it dissolves completely leaving no grit or residue he first tried it in a ounce mug and found it to be a little strong but was perfect in his ounce travel mug
positive,5/9/21,this is a great stand in when you can t make it out to starbucks love having an instant version at home love love love it
positive,25/5/21,bought a case to see what it was about i am a night owl which effects my day to day performance and father related tasks after a can i do feel mellow and finding myself going to bed much earlier
positive,7/9/21,i love the fact that this is multi grain baby food but like people food good for you things never taste great so mix it with bananas or some other fruit yes the texture is a bit difficult to swallow for little ones hence why you want to thin it out i read the other reviews and can t believe they never thought to mix this food with something else
positive,11/9/21,we love this vegetable pouch for our month old and more importantly she likes it too i like that it has sort of a dry texture compared to basic blended vegetables i stir a touch of milk into it each time and it makes it really creamy she always finishes it and its one of our favorites
positive,13/7/21,i ordered these as a gift in june they tasted great they did not arrive in picture perfect condition due to the heat but i was contacted by the company to see what they could do for me the strength of a company is not found in things that go correctly but rather in the things that go wrong and what they do about them i would recommend them highly

positive,22/6/21,we usually have fresh lemon grass tea at our local zen center it is extremely easy to make put a few blades of lemon grass in a pot to steep and you will get a fantastic tasting tea this tea is here is a fine replacement for when you cannot get fresh lemon grass lemon grass has many health benefits it is said to detoxify the liver and can lower uric acid levels this is important if you have gout because you get such a large quantity here on amazon it should last you quite a while caffeine free and light it makes a very refreshing afternoon tea give it a try thank you for reading my review
positive,28/7/21,tazo sweet cinnamon spice tea is a very tasteful tea with no unpleasant after taste i am not sure what a person can say about tea but this flavor is one of the best i have ever had it makes great hot tea or iced tea it s pleasant flavor is a treat all by itself and is excellent without any sweetener some teas leave a bitter or strange after taste but this tea does not every cup is very special even if you leave the tea bag in your cup for a long time it never gets bitter wonderful product tazo sweet cinnamon spice herbal infusion tea caffeine free count tea bags pack of
positive,13/10/21,not bad this tea does not taste like an oolong tea i m sure if they say it s oolong then it probably is an oolong but it really tastes more like a green tea it s also very mildly flavored i find it benefits from a longer brew time than recommended there s certainly no bitterness upon over brewing this tea as there would be with a black tea and the slight floral flavor and fragrance seems to be enhanced rather than harmed by this the flower bloom is durable i put an unfinished pot in the refrigerator overnight to try it as iced tea and the flower survived perfectly well without disintegrating if anything the tea benefited from the additional overnight brew served cold the flavor comes out even more if you re partial to iced tea the flower arrangement upon brewing is pretty nowhere near as pretty or as perfect as the pictures that numi shows on their website and it s as likely to bloom lopsided as it is to flower right side up some of them even bloom upside down don t expect perfection and you ll be pleased with it
positive,19/2/21,can t find this or anything like it in our stores anymore good to know i can get it on here
positive,14/12/20,excellent choice for a high fiber cracker these taste great and like other back to nature items don t have all the undesirable ingredients you d like to avoid if necessary whole wheat safflower oil salt and vitamin e perfect
positive,14/12/20,my family loves the taste of these they re a bit high in sodium for my liking and for the price i wish they were organic i have purchased the heart to heart brand but they taste much staler and have a strange aftertaste compared to these crackers too bad because heart to heart has half the sodium
positive,19/2/21,very closely resembles a triscuit cracker except there is no soy and a bit lighter you will not be disappointed with the taste and texture it is a quality cracker enjoy
positive,24/2/21,i really enjoy wolfgang puck s k cups so far all the ones i ve tried haven t left my stomach churning and this was my first time trying out the sorrento fair trade roast and purchased it on a warehouse amazon price deal i am really happy with my purchase the taste of the sorrento is what i would expect of a medium roast a good smooth blend no bitter acidic after taste and leaves you wanting for more after that first cup at least it left me p it s doesn t leave you with the shhhakes either it has that right balance you need with your daily cup of coffee yes i will be getting another count of this when i am finished with this pack stars
positive,19/2/21,my second purchase of this cofee like the first cup it has been wonderful to wake up to not too bold or brash but a good drink to start the day with
positive,14/12/20,this is a favorite in the office and in my house we burn through this coffee i ve tried a few of the other wolfgang coffees and this one is by far the best i ve seen better prices for this at a lot of other places this is an excellent coffee to start your day with
positive,19/10/21,i bought a small pack of this locally and liked it so much i bought the pack great deal on amazon
positive,18/5/21,i personally don t like strong coffee if you like weaker coffee then this blend is a great choice for you other reviews on here say that its too weak which is probably true if your used to something strong i also use flavored creamer to further enhance the taste for the price it can t hurt to give it a try
positive,19/2/21,i love sumatra coffee and was excited to receive these k cups however was disappointed when i opened my amazon box and found that the plastic wrap holding the two boxes of k cups was full of grinds meaning that there was a possible blowout of a cup after carefully unwrapping the boxes and attempting to get as little coffee grinds everywhere as possible i opened the first box and all cups were fine however the second box every kcup was covered in fine grinds and i had to clean each one and found that of the cups were defective due to the top being stamped on at an angle and the grinds had spilled everywhere i now see other reviews stating they had defective cups as well however the taste of the coffee is good
positive,14/12/20,this is one of the best coffees i have ever had for my keurig it is a nice smooth coffee and the price is the best price i could find i will be buying more
positive,1/6/21,very delicious coffee thankfully amazon sells this flavor now i have been waiting for it since i tasted this last year i like the fact that you sell it in a pack rather than a single
positive,1/4/21,this k cup actually smelled up the office and it tastes as good as it smells i found it to be very flavorful
positive,15/4/21,sometimes we have a problem ordering the k cups because they are way too strong for us even if you order medium blend this coffee was great just right it was a smooth blend and was perfect for a morning cup of coffee or anytime would definitely order again
positive,19/5/21,i have tried about different k cup flavors and this is my favorite it has a wonderful aroma and just the right amount of hazelnut use the subscribe option and this is a deal that can t be beat
positive,14/12/20,tried this for the first time this week and it is now my favorite coffee with a hint of flavor coconut full bodied and no after taste jamaica me crazy is just what i love for an afternoon pick me up or to wake up and have an immediate smile on my face seriously it s awesome highly recommended
positive,29/6/21,this k cup is one of my favorites along with coffee people s jet fuel and black tiger if you like a strong rich coffee this will fit the bill
positive,15/10/21,even with the chocolate chunks these bars taste far less sweeter than most granola bars out there and i really appreciated that they have calories each and grams sugar which is less than kudos chocolate chip cal sugar or a cascadian farms chocolate chip granola bar cal sugar when i need a quick snack i can eat one with a glass of sparkling water and i feel full until the next meal if i need a quick meal i eat one of these with two string cheeses a large apple and water i can make it until dinner i would recommend these to anyone looking for a tasty and quick snack
positive,20/7/21,i am doing the subscribe and save thing with these crackers i thought that it would take a while to get through the six boxes but boy was i wrong already we re halfway through the boxes time to order more
positive,12/10/21,the crackers are very tasty and we just tried them out with a little salsa on top for a healthy low cal snack and my wife and i absolutely love them we will definitely get more once we run out
positive,19/2/21,i would recommend this tea it has a fresh taste with an amazing acai grape flavor that i have not had before it also gave me energy which i can always use
positive,14/12/20,this is oil is quite a good value compared to the grocery store prices we always keep a can in the refrigerator
positive,2/7/21,this is an aromatic and tasty oil great on salads or for scrambled eggs i m sure i ll find more uses for this as time goes on free shipping makes it a great deal my only nit pick is the lid two of the three bottles in the shipment had very tight lids that were difficult to open
positive,11/3/21,i received a jar of this instant espresso as a gift from my mother in law i was quite insulted at first as i ve never used instant coffee of any kind and couldn t figure out why she gave it to me then this past weekend i was out of coffee beans this was all i had must have coffee in morning so i made it wow it was awesome in fact i m drinking a mug of it right now as i right this review i love it however i make it in more of a latte fashion i ve also added hot chocolate to it for a mocha latte i ll definitely be looking for it at my neighborhood stores and if i can t find it i ll be getting it here on amazon definitely a great buy
positive,10/4/21,i know nothing about this co method of decaffeinating but thought i would give this a try i usually buy the swiss water processed this had a wonderful chocolatey taste it also claimed to be caffein free hopefully this is all true because it really is the best i have tried of decaf
positive,22/7/19,when i read the reviews i noticed someone mentioned the box was light it is but it holds a lot these pork rinds are compact they expand when cooked so there s a lot more in the box than it looks like as snacks go these are high in protein and low in carbohydrate i think this is a really good value and these are very flavorful i especially enjoy them with bean dip the only thing that i d change is i d like a lightly salted version i don t always want that much salt
positive,2/2/20,tasty spicy and good became quite the conversation piece at work no one have ever heard of microwave pork rinds before they tasted them and love them only draw back depending on type of microwave as to how they will cook
positive,2/2/20,really easy to prepare and very yummy with my microwave i put them in for and they turn out perfect warm crunchy and tasty and without the carbs they don t impact your blood sugar which is a real boon for us diabetics
positive,22/7/19,i have not had pork rinds in more than years and thought that this would be fun to try but i didn nt have high expectations microwave popcorn is pervasive and a proven success however i had never heard of microwave pork rinds and it was hard to imagine that it could really work as well as popcorn well it does i don t have much with which to compare the taste years ago however the texture and crispiness is just as i remembered i like spicy snacks and as another reviewer noted these are not especially spicy but i used a few shakes of cayenne pepper and that did the job it is very important to shake the bag in order to evenly distrbute the rinds throughout the bag before putting it into the microwave i have also found that mins seconds is the best time in my microwave oven to pop all of the bacon rinds i have eaten bags of the pork rinds and i love them they are light and crunchy and it is my experience that they pop better than popcorn and each bag is only carb
positive,12/1/20,i bought these years ago at walmart and then they stopped carrying them i was searching the internet and found them at amazon we ordered a box of each i like the spicy and my husband likes the orginal a learning process will be a sure thing until you figure out how many minutes for your microwave they are great and we love them
positive,19/2/20,i saw this product demonstrated on the food channel and knew i had to order it as i love pork rinds but the bagged ones are usually old and sort of stale or processed tasting follow carefully the directions with these for a spicy fresh and tasty snack every time yum
positive,27/11/19,wow these are great i had them for the super bowl party and everyone just went nuts over this product great taste and just the right snacking size one word of caution follow the directions even though every bag i cooked was absolutely perfect it was evident if you get distracted they will burn real quick remember this product is not popcorn so there is no sound to help let you know its done again follow the directions they are fabulous
positive,12/12/19,these microwave pork rinds are quite tasty for them to be cooked in the microwave my husband and i love the hot spicy flavor better than the plain because it has more flavor the only drawback i see to these is that if you have an older microwave or one that is not as powerful at least watts the pork rinds do not cook as well
positive,26/9/20,these pork skins have a great taste very fresh homemade taste the cooking procedure can be a bit tricky though i have a w microwave with a turn table and did not get the same results with each bag the first bag i tried with minute and additional second intervls stopping at min seconds several skins had not yet cooked so i rolled the end of the bag back up and gave it more seconds still some did not fully explode or bloom the second bag i started with minute seconds slightly better results but again i needed to re roll the end of the bag and give it another seconds still using the second intervals for best results the third bag i started with minutes which is also the amount of time that is used on my popcorn setting and the results were not as good too many had over cooked and were too hard to eat my suggestion would be to stick with the minute with second intervals listening closely to the sound they emit a slight hissing sound when they expand as soon as the bag has fully opened and the hissing sound subsides it s a good sign you have reached the optimal result this item is a little more work than just picking up a bag of ready to eat at the store but the improved flavor is worth it to me anyway the jury is still out on whether the healthy claim can hold water i will continue to use restraint and only endulge with this treat on occassion good eats
positive,22/7/19,we originally found these at wally world when we could no longer get there i hit the internet both are quite good we prefer the spicy
positive,30/3/20,a delicious product can t seem to find it in the stores these days i recommend to try if you like pork rinds quick delivery and great to have for guests
positive,8/7/20,if your a pork rind lover this is an awesome product for those wonderful taste buds they melt in your mouth before they go down mmm mmm good
positive,4/1/20,it cooks in microwave so fast and it s really good right after you cook but unfortunately it has message in it nonetheless the fat and sodium content on this is not too bad when compared to regular pork rinds i uploaded a photo of the nutrition facts so you can see the ingredients too
positive,30/1/21,if you enjoy pork rinds like i do you can t miss this product a minute and a half in the microwave and you ve got warm crunchy deliciousness there s just the right amount of spice too this is a great product
positive,2/11/20,i found microwave pork rinds quite by accident but ever since they are something i have wanted now i found them on amazon and i couldn t be happier it s a quick easily prepared snack and as other reviewers have pointed out not bad for your diet once they come put of the microwave open the bag pour them out and marvel as you hear them still popping and crackling in the bowl i may never go back to bagged pork rinds ever again
positive,22/7/19,stars on taste beef tastes like it was grilled before it was added to the chili the only thing that concerns me is the grams of sugar that can t be good for you
positive,2/2/20,this chile was surprising good and not overly salty or processed tasting actually a good light and tasty lunch
positive,4/10/20,the amita peach nectar is a very tasty natural fruit drink that is loaded with sugar so if you are looking for an alternative to orange juice and can tolerate the calories you might want to give this drink a try also it makes a nice ingredient in mixed alcoholic beverages such as peach bellinis
positive,1/4/20,tastes great and it s a quality product at a price a few dollars cheaper than the alternatives even at our local supermarkets it s tough to find grade a medium amber syrup in pints i ll probably just keep ordering these a few times a year
positive,8/5/20,this is one of the few teas that i will always have on hand it is a wonderful blend of beneficial herbs that has a great taste i drink it almost every day
positive,18/6/20,i saw this tea from my friend s room and asked for a couple she has the super slimming tea and the detox tea i usually combine the two it made me go to the bathroom more frequently than usual but i feel much relieved like more refreshed my pimples went away and my back acne is non existent the store in my area stopped selling this kind of brand sucks i have to purchased it on line now
positive,20/8/20,these are my favorites and i have reordered more than once perfect for desert without all the calories and is soooo good cannot find these locally so go to amazon for my candy fix
positive,1/6/21,nature s path makes some excellent cereals and this is definitely one of them i really enjoy it because it has great flavor a good crunch and is a very healthy food in fact this is my favorite cereal hands down i totally recommend buying the pack of a penny saved is a penny earned besides it s not like the cereal is going to go bad it ll keep for months until you break the seal
positive,4/7/21,i recieved the delivery quicker than i thought i would i was concerned with how the food item would be packaged the gyro slices were still frozen when i recieved them the gyro slices were delicious they taste better than most of the restaurants i frequent
positive,5/2/20,excellent product great taste perfect portion only calories in a bag i microwave it for and it comes out perfect each time fills a medium tupperware bowl and it was an very good value only for boxes shipped only cents for each bag
positive,22/7/19,i was placed on a severly restricted sodium diet three years ago and one day at my local market happened upon this product it was like i finally had stepped back into the world of taste if you have ever read nutrition labels on soups you know a sodium restricted diet does not allow for the vast majority of them so now i can have a healthy organic warm bowl of comforting soup whenever i like and if i purchase it through amazon by the case shipping is free making it a lot less expensive then my local market give it a try
positive,2/2/20,i m on a low sodium diet and this still has plenty of taste without salt
positive,22/11/20,since i have to watch my sodium i have looked for a very low sodium soup for quite awhile campbell s made one but no longer does if you had tried theirs this one is far tastier and better
positive,1/3/20,this was a great sampler of green coffee to roast i haven t tried them all yet but i liked the variety of regions and it really was a great product for a great price
positive,23/11/20,taken is taken but after you have a lot of different kinds you tend to establish a taste favorite basically if the price is good go for it
positive,5/4/21,this grain is an excellent substitute for rice it only takes two cans of chicken broth to one package of quinoa to make a lot of very tasty and filling finished product which can be used with gravy sauce mixed vegetables or anything you like
positive,27/4/20,ok folks listen up for special occasions we ll spend the big bucks and get a rack of lamb you re lucky today if you can even find it in the stores it s so expensive often at per pound so the very last thing you want to do after spending all that money is ruin it with the wrong flavoring colorado spices new zealand lamb rub has the right blend of herbs that goes well on just about any meat we just used it on some fresh bluefin and yellowfin tuna and it was fantastic my year old mother who cooks every day and is not a huge spice fan she s used to plain new england cooking loves and uses the rub on chicken lamb and fish she s having me order another case and loves the individual packets as the rub does not lose its taste or flavor and stays fresh this is a great product
positive,8/3/21,i have never had any hot chocolate that tastes better than this not homemade not from starbucks not from swissmiss this is hands down the best i ve ever had i go through so much of this stuff because whenever friends come over they go straight for it but what happened to the price most k cups run from about but amazon has these things going for even bed bath beyond has them cheaper than that bring the price back down to something reasonable and your star review will return
positive,30/1/20,this is a fantastic soy based product that s not too sweet is very smoothe and wonderfully chocolaty i highly recommend this
positive,22/7/19,my year old loves to make a cup of this before school every morning the cocoa tastes wonderful and brews up nice we add a splash of milk to cool it off and it s so good i don t taste anything artificial in fact the quality is great we will bring this camping for the younger kids with the powders we always had clumps this brews a great cup every time and tastes like the expensive coffee shop stuff
positive,2/2/20,the local auto shop offers this free to it customers i ve tried it twice and liked it both times perhaps if i had to pay for it i might not love the price but i would still enjoy the flavor
positive,2/9/20,our beloved bengal kitty isabel is years old and suffering from kidney stones which are inoperable in felines for years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health declined our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she d eat she might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years so we offered her one soft food after another she turned up her nose at the expensive vet sold brands and repeatedly rejected one national brand and flavor after another finally to her gustatory delight and our great relief she made her choice this particular wiskas version is the only kind she ll eat day in and day out it must be whiskas with the turkey and giblets in gravy the gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she can t resist we surmise that like humans our pets have food preferences linked to palate pleasing aroma and taste this whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our izzy no it s not the best choice for managing kidney stones but she s got to eat so you won t worry that we re ignoring her renal problems she s on daily medication and is doing quite well it s not an inexpensive cat food but its packaging is very convenient and space saving the amazon auto ship program is a life saver the cartons always arrive on time and the per package bulk rate is lower than the price of small quanities also our local target was the only place we could find this exact variety and now the store no longer carries it remember our cat demands giblets and gravy and accepts no substitutes give autoship a try the price is better and you can easily adjust the quantity and frequency of shipment or cancel altogether
positive,26/1/21,great cheese wonderful flavor made my spaghetti meatballs better than it s ever been made the lasagna even better fast delivery
positive,9/1/21,i recommend using half water and half skim milk i usually mix oz water with oz skim milk and heat in the micro for two minutes add the packet and sugar or sweetener great for a quick cup of coffee without the hassle of cleaning the machine
positive,30/7/21,this honey granules is tasty and a welcome alternative to cane sugar i use it in my morning oats steel cut oats bird s custard and tea one or two teaspoonfuls go a long way it is better stored in the refrigerator consider it in place of over processed store bought cane sugar
positive,30/10/20,i am a peanut butter fanatic and i get excited every time amazon offers a bulk order of peanut butter at a low price i use peanut butter as a mid day energy boosting snack straight off the spoon and without any other food to supplement it it s just that good to me i was more than happy with skippy reduced fat creamy i like the smooth texture it has and it has a great mouth feel that isn t the thick stick to the roof of my mouth kind that requires a glass of milk to be able to eat i don t feel that skippy reduced the flavor from its original peanut butter along with the fat to make this product it tastes delicious and satisfying if you re a peanut butter lover like me please look out for the fantastic prices amazon has on skippy reduced fat creamy you won t regret buying it and the reduced fat intake is a bonus
positive,3/8/20,this is the first redued fat peanut butter that i have thought was a good peanut butter i will buy it again when this is gone
positive,29/1/21,this pb tastes good and is goood for you it makes good sandwiches i only wish it were in stock more often
positive,24/10/21,hemp foods are great the slightly nutty taste is always something i enjoy i almost rated this item four stars because it doesn t have a strong hemp seed taste but after some thought it is probably best that way i add a bit of brown sugar and one packet will fill me up not true with most other oatmeals
positive,24/10/21,great taste almonds are high in overall fat but low in saturated fats that most contribute to weight gain buy a case they stay pretty fresh when sealed for months
positive,24/10/21,if you like a strong but smooth flavorful coffee this is it i have tried others and just keep coming back to this one my second joice would be the starbucks italian blend
positive,25/9/21,i am on a gluten free diet and find most gluten free snack high in calories and fat these cookies are awesome the serving size is cookies calorie count per serving is between and and fat is between and great flavor and crunch and almost healthy
positive,19/10/21,what s not to like delicious smokehouse almonds in the perfect size package i keep them in my locker at the gym for a post workout snack they are very smokey don t leave an open package in your car like i did it made my car smell like cigarettes however this is unlikely to happen as it is hard to only eat part of the package as they are so good
positive,19/10/21,very beautiful and added a wonderful appearance to some of our christmas cookies tasted good as well with no bitter or chemical flavor a good alternative to all the frosting that is popular these days on cookies
positive,15/6/21,i switched my cat to halo s salmon indoor formula and have noticed a marked difference in her coat and reduced smell from the litter box cats are snobs when it comes to food switching them to a new food takes at least a week more if you have a picky eater like me start small and work more in each day if you moved from a diet of raman noodles to a high protein high fiber diet instantly you wouldn t want to eat it either you get what you pay for when you buy food for yourself or your pet
positive,4/8/21,as other s have mentioned this is available in other stores for much cheaper so i recommend to shop around before buying on amazon when it comes to the actual product i highly recommend buying this if you own a keurig you are able to discretly hide so many of the keurig cups the carousel is a neat product but when you don t have counter space it just doesn t work this unit is pretty great quality but i do find that it is tough to slide sometimes the material that they use on the top of the tray makes sure that your keurig doesn t move at all highly recommend that you pick one up whether it be from bbb or amazon
positive,18/7/21,i eat these cookies frequently using the subscribe method the nutrition provided is high quality i recommend all the erin cookies for a snack or meal
positive,18/10/21,i am surprised by how good this breakfast cookie s flavor is it has depth of spices and textures and is truly delicious calories seemed a bit high but i ate one with a large glass of water and it has been hours and my tummy is not growling yet i even worked out too i love that it doesn t have any freaky ingredients and it was very soft and moist i gave a little pinch of it to my toddler daughter and she enjoyed it too i prefer to have actual oatmeal in the morning with fruit and yogurt but these breakfast cookies are great if the morning goes sideways and i don t have time or opportunity to fix something the problem i found with other protein bars and such is that in about hours i was feeling peckish and looking for snacks until lunch i did not have that problem with this breakfast cookie it may have more calories than i thought i wanted to spend but it is very worth it since it keeps me out of the kitchen until lunchtime another nice thing there are not any chips or icing on this cookie to melt in the mid day heat so you can keep one of these in the purse or diaper bag without creating a big mess for yourself later i keep them in the freezer for freshness they are really moist and chewy once you let them thaw or microwave i put one on a saucer and nuke for seconds from frozen solid it turns out like its warm from the oven i do not recommend keeping them in the fridge baked goods and bread will get dried out if kept there update i have lost pounds in the last year with very minimal changes and these cookies have helped me go from not eating breakfast and snacking all morning to eating breakfast no matter how busy and not needing to snack or eat until lunchtime they are very filling and are perfect for when you don t have time to make anything
positive,15/6/21,so far have tried two flavors this and oat raisins and prefer the other better this flavor tastes a little bland compared to the other for some reason even though it has more ingredients but it s not inedible or anything just a little bland as for whether it helps you feel full i d say it doesn t for me because it s just a oz size afterall and i m used to eating a lot more but i always skip breakfast so eating this is better than nothing considering studies show breakfast is the most important meal of the day eating breakfast also helps you lose weight and raise metabolism i d give the taste stars but bought it for amazing cents each cookie so price gets stars which average out to stars
positive,4/8/21,i first purchased erin baker s breakfast cookie in the caramel apple flavor while it was tasty and very fulfilling i wasn t forsure if i was in love with them and really why waste your time eating something you don t love so based on customer reviews i then tried the morning glory breakfast cookie i loved the bits of nut and i have to say it is tasty and fulfilling it is my nd favorite cookie and i easily give them a star rating i again began browsing the cookie flavors and spent time reading customer reviews and decided to try the peanut butter chocolate chunk and all i can say is third times the charm these breakfast cookies are knock your socks off delicious i plan on stocking up so that i don t have to order over the hot summer months as i have read on some of the cookie reviews that because these cookies are so fresh and have no preservatives to prevent spoilage that they are prone to mold if left out to long so i figure why take the chance i m just going to make several purchases before summer gets here i totally recommend these breakfast cookies my only wish is that they came in a variety box so one isn t forced to purchase a whole pack to sample one flavor yes they are a little high calorie so you might not want to use them as a snack but for a meal replacement they are fantastic i love the natural ingredients and i know these cookies are fresh makes you wonder how fresh those meal replacement bars are that sit on the store shelf for months
positive,8/6/21,these cookies are tasty but just a little too gooey and the calorie count is for one cookie this is a bit high
positive,15/6/21,this has recently become my staple breakfast cereal after trying many high on taste low on nutrition cereals i decided to find one that fits my needs i am a regular at the gym so i have to watch what i eat this one is not only high in protein and fiber but also tastes much better that the other similar cereals with high fiber it can easily become addictive as it has the right balance between taste and nutrition the price is affordable too and the product can be easily found in grocery stores
positive,4/8/21,sustainably caught off the california coast packaged as disclosed in a previous review i feel a tad guilty buying at at time at the local co op but they are simply the best tasting sardines distinctive and flavorful you know you are buying premium product compared to the plethora of sardine purveyors out there nordic portugal mediterranean etc the cool waters off the california are well known for sardines
positive,25/9/21,just had a can of these and wanted to confirm the great quality of this product excellent taste and three big sardines barely fitting into the can i ll get more
positive,19/10/21,i love this coffee it has very good flavor for decaf i have been looking for a good decaf coffee because i ve been trying to give up caffeine and this is the best one i have found so far
positive,4/9/21,i looked a long time for dark roast decaf that tasted like this one does the package doesn t say where it is grown but it tastes like columbian beans to me i hope amazon keeps handling it great coffee gerald
positive,31/8/21,great product our dog is loving a tasting treat that is good for her year old bones
positive,15/6/21,i like these they are not gas producing and they hold shape ok for canned beans flavor is good love that they don t have added salt
positive,4/8/21,i bought these on super sale because i needed them for a pie crust and they were cheap i got the pack and was at first dismayed to find that they were not packed like other graham crackers are usually packed they were loose in a bag not stacked in bricks to fill the box this meant there were many less per box than i had anticipated but when i tried one i was immediately impressed they taste fantastic these taste nothing like the kind of graham crackers we were fed in kindergarden they have actual flavor and are much more than just an ingredient or child s fare what these lack in volume they make up for in quality i immediately ordered three more packs while they were so cheap i have a toddler at home and am happy to supply us all with these wonderful graham crackers they do not have any scary fillers or ingredients they are made with butter and not trans fat and you can snack on nine of them with your coffee for only calories not bad they also make a pie crust that is noticeably better than what i used to make dessert crusts with i was so impressed at what stonewall kitchen could do to a graham cracker that i am going to check out other products they make
positive,15/6/21,this tastes great at first it tastes a bit strange but i enjoyed the slight coffee taste i mixed the amazing green superfood the chocolate version with it which made the amazing green taste much better i need to buy more of this hemp shake since i m out it really makes the amazing green taste much better i mix it with milk using a little wisk which works well i recommend this to anyone trying to be healtheir boost their immune system and it is a great snack try both the products together it s a great combination i have been using it regularly for a few months now and i have noticed that i have stayed healthy i even managed to go to disney world during the new year holiday without getting sick as a teacher getting sick is common for me but i have noticed that i ve been healthier since using these products give it a try
positive,4/8/21,i agree with the others that say this is one of the best hemp shakes out there i started off with the original nutiva hemp powder and once i finished that i decided to try the chocolate it is amazing it is much easier for me to gulp this down in the morning i mix it up in a blender bottle also sold on amazon with a little water and some type of milk i really like mixing it with vanilla hemp milk or whole grain rice milk but regular milk works fine too nutiva is the least grainy hemp shake i have come across yet i have tried several kinds and even though i can drink them i much prefer nutiva over any other
positive,15/6/21,originally tried this because it was on sale and i figured that even if it was gross i d only be out a buck happily it tastes great mainly have used it in coffee and tea just ordered my second box
positive,4/8/21,how nice it is to no longer be deprived of pasta and noodles if you follow a low carb lifestyle then house foods shirataki tofu noodles are heaven sent i ve been enjoying this product for well over a year and i m so very happy to have found it i heard about it on the dr oz show and ran right out and bought some i ve tried the fettucine and spaghetti noodles also but the angel hair is the most versatile people who found them too rubbery probably did not follow the package directions for best results they have to be thoroughly rinsed and parboiled for at least three minutes i am also amazed at how forgiving this product is once i got distracted and let the noodles simmer for almost minutes and they still turned out fine maybe even better if you want that ramen like flavor do this after parboiling and drying saute them over high heat in a skillet with peanut oil and or sesame oil or hot chile oil add a few shakes of salt onion garlic powder and toss then just carry on with your recipe they re very much like rice noodles so you won t miss a beat with stir frys and noodle soups i ve also had great success with italian dishes i ve used them with meatballs or italian sausage in marinara sauce also with shrimp scallops in a cream wine sauce just to name a few topped with grated melted cheese i got all of the joy and practically none of the carbs however one package really only serves one this is an excellent healthy alternative to pasta and noodles that will not wreak havoc upon your glycemic index good cooks will have no problem incorporating this into their menu planning
positive,1/10/21,i can t recommend this company enough i always receive my pepsie s within two days the price is far less than i pay for it here plus i get it delivered to my door
positive,1/7/18,great flavors and crunchiness sometimes gluten free food can be bland but these are really flavorful this is also a great buy if you compare only buying one bag of these to the variety that you get
positive,10/8/18,this salt is so good you could almost eat it plain i am telling you sprinkling this with your fingers onto salads chicken fish is amazing definitely don t waste this by cooking it where you could use regular salt this salt needs to be tasted as it really brings out the flavour of food in a really beautiful way this is meant to be sprinkled on foods after they have cooked roasted chicken for example or on raw vegetables like tomatoes or cucumbers this is the foodie s salt now i have noticed this salt is easier to buy in the regular grocery stores so if you can buy it there where it is cheaper to do so
positive,1/7/18,i bought these to share with the office and the disappeared almost instantly they are very good and contain enough protein to keep people going while suppressing that snacky feeling these are a great snack to carry with you as they are very light for example on a flight or road trip i highly recommend that you try a few of the other flavors as well they have this snack in chicken turkey and beef in various flavors
positive,10/8/18,we have been looking for a cracker for our daughter whom we have just put on the gfcf diet the glutino cracker is about as close to a normal cracker that we have come across the rest of us who are not on the diet even think these are good they have a yummy buttery and salty taste to them we bought them here on amazon com in a case of boxes for very reasonable highly recommend to anyone on the gfcf diet who misses their crackers makes a nice snack to pack in the car for road trips or flights
positive,13/9/18,i bought this product for my son who is in grad school he said emeril s k cups were the best tasting ones he has tried so far i will definitely buy them for him again
positive,17/7/18,tried a new coffee recently and have to say that emerils gourmet coffee was just what i expected a dark bold flavor that i love
positive,16/1/19,i am a coffee fanatic drink it day and night no coffee does not keep me awake i am enjoying the flavor of emerils bold when i got my keurig it came with a sample pak and in it were two samples of emerils coffee i immediately went to amazon to see if i could order larger amounts than at the keurig site i am so glad i did as yes amazon had larger paks at a very reasonable price this will become one of my repeat orders in the future
positive,16/1/18,we love this product our baby is months old and we re introducing new foods to her so far she has tried the pumpkin and she can t get enough she grabs for the spoon we love that this product is organic and that use can use breastmilk to mix so your baby gets added nutrients it s portable compact and you can take it anywhere if at a restaurant or away from home simply warm up your milk and combine it s really fantastic
positive,16/1/19,if you used to buy old el paso refried beans with sausage and liked that product which they do not produce anymore this is the next best thing i tried these and they are very good better than any home made stuff i tried to do i tried special ordering with my local grocery but they said they could not get the product in and amazon has a better price than the website for latin products i would definitely recommend this product and will purchase again
positive,1/8/20,pamela s makes some of the best tasting cookies i have ever had i have never tasted a bad product from this company all the cookies are great but this one is my favorite of all time they re moist chewy and a much healthier choice than most other cookies on the market so if you are on a diet or not if you are sensitive to wheat or not these taste great i look forward to the day that pamela s expands their product line
positive,1/7/18,i love pineapple juice and drink it every day fresh is the best but this is surprisingly good i usually keep some on hand for convenience it is so much better tasting than the stuff from concentrate the price on amazon is kind of high though i find it s cheaper just to stock up at our local grocer
positive,10/8/18,this orzo is absolutely great this is the first time i have eaten it and it blends beautifully with vegetables i love salads and this is the way i used the orzo orzo salad cup orzo red and green pepper amount you want onion amount you want celery amount you want yellow squash amount you want black beans drained and washed white shoepeg corn drained and washed tlbs red wine vinegar tlbs of olive oil packet of splenda salt and pepper to taste bring enough water to boil that will cover the orzo about and inch over the top add the orzo to the boiling water and salt to taste boil for to minutes do not overcook chop the veggies and add the corn and black beans drain the orzo run cold water over the pasta and add to the veggies mix the vinegar olive oil and one packet of splenda together salt and pepper to taste drizzle over the veggies and orzo mix well will keep well to days in the ref tip you can subsitute any vegetable you prefer as peas cauliflower broccoli carrot etc
positive,15/2/20,very nice product for those wanting to enjoy the pleasure of lasagna but are on a gluten free diet great alternative
positive,22/4/21,this is very good maple syrup but like most pure maple syrup it is very expensive my husband and i duped ourselves when purchasing this product we did the math wrong and though that we were paying about for a half gallon rather than only oz man was i surprised to see how small the jug was when it came in the mail
positive,25/9/20,i really like the pamelas products whenever bars they have a chocolately coconut taste and not too sweet which is great only grams of sugar it is filling and i would order these in the future
positive,16/11/19,these are actually pretty good i was not expecting to like them i don t like chocolate and coconut together but i did they are soft and chewy and great for a snack they are wheat gluten and dairy free so they are pretty good for those with allergies or food sensitivities each bar has calories which is pretty standard they do have calories or grams of fat g of which are saturated the rest of the contents are pretty good with g of sugar and g of whole grains the ingredients are all things you can pronounce and has none of the weird chemicals the bar is pretty chewy and tasty i liked it and may even buy them
positive,9/9/20,these bars are a perfect healthy snack for satisying a sweet tooth they re moisty chewy and just sweet enough they don t contain corn syrup and you won t miss the wheat or dairy
positive,1/7/18,this snack was tasty and seemed to be healthy however i would not rate it as being special or see myself making it a go to energy bar right now i prefer clif bars and powerbars
positive,10/8/18,every pup i have ever owned loved these treats they will do anything for them and only like this brand i tried another and they refused to eat them if you love your pups and treat them like children buy these mine are not too spolied diva and tiffany they get them every holiday and i am never without a supply on hand try greenies too
positive,15/1/20,forget cheetos these are the best ever same price or less if on sale and better for you i could eat a bag by myself but the kids beat me to it
positive,1/9/20,i was able to try these chips from a food show sample and i fell in love they taste great plus they are much healthier than the average chip definitely recommend this product let s get these in stores
positive,22/7/21,my parents love this stuff and they re actually asians so that speaks volumes it s such an easy quick convenient food to stock up for them for whenever they drop in to visit me and i haven t nothing but white people food lying around but i m sure that it ll go a long way toward feeding the starving college student types as well i think that it s a perfect combination of flavor for price but i have to admit that i would not purchase this item at amazon as it is far more affordable if you buy from an asian grocery if you found this review helpful please let me know
positive,1/7/18,i had this for lunch and i enjoyed the flavor and the spice level it was a little salty for my taste but not too bad some people suggest not to use the whole flavor packet to reduce the saltiness but that would also reduce the amount of heat the bowl was easy to prepare and it was enough for me for lunch given the hagh salt content and low nutritional value i would eat this occasionally not often to satisfy a craving
positive,10/8/18,bought this in the maui costco and thought it tasted so great we dragged home the unfinished huge bag of oatmeal went to our local costco and they did not sell it but another type of cut oatmeal which is not nearly as good and a different texture this is a fine tasting healthy oatmeal
positive,14/5/21,one of my favorites hopefully this continues at a reasonable price each k cup brews perfectly well pleased will continue to order as long as it is a suscribe and save item
positive,3/10/21,i love this coffee it s my favorite so far i want to try them all i don t like strong coffee and i hate bitter after taste coffee to me this is the perfect cup of coffee i m not telling everyone to go out and buy it this is my own opinion
positive,15/9/20,this is the food my vet recommends it is produced about or miles away from where i live and they source only local ingredients nothing comes from china so it is a food i feel very comfortable with i know that this company cares about my pet s health and takes it seriously and it is very reasonably priced at one of my local pet food stores now there are those who would point to the oats and vegetables and declare it unacceptable but my cat never throws up or has diarrhea with eagle pack he seems to do best on the lamb variety and the duck variety the turkey one gave him slightly softer stools for some reason i think the price and quality make us both happy for now i d love to feed him the optimal diet probably raw but i still have some reservations about it that i would have to come to terms with so for now we re sticking with this
positive,30/8/20,for someone with a gluten problem this is the best spaghetti on the market without a doubt
positive,1/7/18,how much can you say about a drink it tastes pretty good it s got a nice flavor sweet but not overly so and there s a good amount of fizz there s a lot of sugar for the amount of drink you have and at only fluid ounces there just isn t much there what s there is good though
positive,10/8/18,this is a good drink tastes like soda but fruity i really liked it nice alternative to soda
positive,5/12/19,this is very good a nice berry flavor with just a hint of kiwi and very sweet even with no added sugar the fruit flavors are strong but very natural without the unpleasant mouthfeel and aftertaste some fruit beverages can leave you with the carbonation is nice it s not too bubbly but just pleasantly effervescent this is a product i would definitely buy at a convinence store instead of a soda but i had to take away one star since i think it is a bit overpriced for what it is
positive,21/10/19,let me start out by saying that one can of switch just wasn t enough at least not when you re sharing it in order to properly review this i had my children join me in a little taste test of this product well the best litmus test of whether something is good or not is if your kids want more and mine both did but i wasn t sharing any more of this delicious drink no sir i m happy to report that the remainder of this libation was imbibed by yours truly i m not generally of big fan of the carbonated juice drinks but switch could switch my mind the kiwi strawberry taste was just right not too sweet and blended well with the carbonation for a drink that was tasty and refreshing in fact this drink would be great for a hot day or after a workout when you want something with some bite and don t really want or need another soda this is good stuff get some
positive,8/9/20,i have to admit i liked the watermelon strawberry flavor better than this one kiwi berry but this was just as flavorful and just as pleasant just the right amount of carbonation and sweetness and i really loved the fact this has no corn syrup or refined sugar the small can size is also very handy because it s easy to slip into a bag and it s exactly one serving size as i mentioned with the other flavor this drink doesn t have a weird aftertaste or leave a lingering flavor on the tongue it s very clean and refreshing
positive,22/9/21,great combination of coffee chocolate and raspberry flavors stays fresh in the bag for a long time a bit more astringent than i usually like but still very good
positive,2/10/20,i tasted this last week and thought it was excellent the fact it has fiber is goodness that said i ll be going with the peach flavor because it also packs a bit of protein
positive,25/7/20,i was a biscuit and gravy person before i found out that i was gluten intolerant this is the best biscuit mix i have found so far
positive,4/7/21,not much to say good stuff amazon s grocery concept is great and i look forward to ordering more now if only they offered coffee mate s vanilla chai spice creamer that is some amazingly delicious powder right there try it if you haven t yet
positive,11/9/21,the gluten free pantry chocolate truffle brownie mix ounce boxes pack of my daughter was recently diagnosed with a wheat allergy as well as some other allergies such as the hormones and antibiotics in milk and eggs so we have gone organic it has impacted our food choices but she is and we did not want her to feel as though she was different we began the search began for tasty treats that she could eat without pain we found this item and it is the most wonderful thing we could have tried for her we throw in an extra egg and a bunch of chocolate chips i have never been much of a brownie fan but these can fool even the most die hard they are fantastic she loves them as do all of us i feel like i should advertise for this company absolutely amazing
positive,4/7/21,this brownie mix is super easy to make you only add ingredients to it and it only takes a couple minutes from mix to oven it has real chocolate chuncks in the mix which melts to make it a very yummy tasting brownie even our friends who don t eat gluten free prefer these to regular mixes i always keep a case of this in the closet
positive,21/9/21,i have tried these and this is a very good mix i add more chocolate chips and they were very chewy and moist
positive,11/9/21,this is a nice ground coffee and the price is very reasonable the grind is finer than what is normal for auto drip makers which is good because i can use less so it goes much further making it even more economical i have purchased it on more than one occasion and would definitely buy again
positive,12/10/21,buy it now please these are just great with perfect flavor and texture i keep them in the refer where they are even more refreshing try them with different things in salads with crudite with good dark chocolate with your tea in the morning as we do a
positive,11/10/21,good substitute for sugar i like it much better than stevia which to me has an awful after taste i did notice though that the erythritol isn t quite as sweet as sugar which can make it just a little expensive
positive,28/9/21,i could eat this right out of the jar i am using it to replace the natural oily peanut butter i use in my smoothies it is alot less messy and tastes delicious even my husband is surprised love it
positive,19/10/21,love love this item i bought the regular and chocolate and enjoy them both i mix mine equal parts powder a water and it is perfect on crackers as a dipper or just off the spoon for a quick protein rich low fat snack i have also used it in protein shakes and diped raw apple and pear slices right into the powder too yum try it
positive,4/7/21,it really does taste good i don t like to measure anything so if you put in too much water you can just add more peanut powder to make it thicker though if you don t like the creamy kind of peanut butter and only like the chunky kind this might not be for you
positive,11/9/21,i was sceptical of this product when i received it but was sold once i gave it a try a little bit of water and you have peanut butter that your diet will like it is great in protein shakes baked items or just to eat by the spoonful reconstituted of course i have been reccommending it to everyone
positive,12/9/21,these beans were really very good added a ham slice while cooking and came out great each time i ve made the soup it s be consistently yummy
positive,13/7/21,our family loves these chips they are light not too greasy and the seaweed taste is fantastic my wife is from japan so she turned us on to these chips
positive,23/10/21,i have been drinking celsius now for around months prior to that i had tried several of the other energy drinks out there and always regretted it later because of all the extra calories in them when i first found celsius i figured it was too good to be true it claims to actually burn up to calories per can while i cannot comment on the calorie burning effect i do find it has a great taste the best of any energy drink out there that i have tried and does give me a boost of energy i drink one every morning overall i love this product i will purchasing this from amazon which was almost cheaper for the pack than the store i normally go to on a regular basis from now on
positive,22/9/21,this stuff is good and i mean really good my husband drinks diet soda which contains aspartame a known neurological toxin and i wanted to provide a much safer alternative i found this at pcc and he loved it i can t stand the taste of artificially sweetened things and i usually end up with a nasty migraine and this didn t bother me one bit the taste is fantastic in my opinion but this seems to be a flavor you will either love or hate which is why i would recommend picking up a pack at the market before ordering a pack of
positive,11/9/21,this recipe is my favorite i bought boxes of this flavor during last years deer hunting season everyone who tried this was impressed with the flavor i did add some liquid smoke some salt and additional cayenne pepper to some of my batches i make enough deer jerky to fill up gallon bags every season and this is by far the best i have tried to date
positive,8/8/21,i received this product in record time i tried it once and ordered again in bulk and am hooked love the product and the company is excellent as far as packaging and the swift arrival time of my purchase i would recommend to all my friends
positive,9/7/21,i drink coffee in the morning for the kick i ordered this coffee because the low acid twist intrigued me promptly forgot about that aspect until it was time to reorder which was sooner than expected because i started enjoying a second cup per day yes there s definitely something to the low acid as my stomach can tolerate two cups per day but i want that second cup due to the coffee s taste quite flavorful with good depth
positive,24/10/21,i found this while stationed in italy and really missed them when i moved back to the states i was discussing them the other night and decided to order some from amazon they are still fantastic i eat them as a treat or as a pick me up when coffee is not available it is a shame they are not more widely available in stores the small amount of coffee filled with ground beans is a wonderful treat
positive,4/7/21,my puppy a week bernese mountain dog has a very sensitive stomach and frequent diarrhea so she was on an expensive vet prescribed diet for the first two weeks that i had her eventually she needed a more growth oriented food so i switched her over to eukanuba large breed puppy on the recommendation of the vet but she still rarely had solid stools also each day her coat seemed less shiny she had a ton of dandruff and scratched like crazy after only a week on canidae i m gradually mixing more and more of it in and decreasing the eukanuba she s stopped itching and her poop is way more solid and far less frequent i know there s no perfect pet food but if you have a dog with a sensitive stomach and or possible allergies i m thinking corn or another filler that eukanuba and iams uses canidae could be a godsend it has been for me every dog deserves a better quality food than one with by products and a ton of fillers and some like my pup simply can t handle that low quality stuff
positive,11/9/21,these pouches are the next best to homemade when i don t have time to steam and blend my own baby food i always reach for happy baby
positive,24/10/21,my cats are very picky but they love this food it is very dense and provides a large amount of good quality food for my two cats i especially like the fact that there are garden greens inside the food it is good for their digestion
positive,22/6/21,i believe this is the same brand a lot of coffee shops use sugar free tastes great at the price i paid it is worth having a coffee shop at home
positive,30/7/21,i have chf with cardiomyopathy i have to limit my sodium to under mg per day because of great products like this ketchup i can do that pretty easily most days my cardioelectrophysicist had never heard of no salt ketchup he thinks it s great heinz no salt ketchup tastes wonderful it has a slightly stonger tomato flavor but i wouldn t have guessed it was no salt i use it for homemade bbq sauce french fries etc it s awesome highly recommended
positive,10/7/21,tasty and simple everyone loves a bite so make an ugly one you can justify trying out
positive,4/7/21,this was not what i expected it is very sweet with bits of candied orange rind and garlic but i really did not notice any chili with chili in the title i expected some heat but there was none definitely needs heat
positive,20/9/21,i have suffered from heartburn for years and never thought that it might be due to the coffee i drink so i was very excited to give this a try i loved the taste of the coffee and my heartburn might have been a tad bit better but it wasn t significant i guess it is possible that my heartburn is due to something other than the coffee i drink i would still recommend this product though because it is very good coffee
positive,13/10/21,i have been trying to find a good coffee that would not set off my ulcer and still tasted good puroast low acid coffee french roast is perfect for me it tasted rich full bodied and no harsh afterbite and it doesn t make my heartburn flare up you will never miss anything this coffee has to offerr except your heartburn
positive,2/8/21,preferences for type of coffee varies from person to person so i m not surprised some people like this brand and some do not i drink coffee every day and have tried many different types i ve never tried low acid coffee before so was not sure what to expect in my opinion this was very good it has a rich dark roasted starbuck like taste i recommend trying it
positive,11/6/21,i only got to drink one cup of this to make this review but i thought it tasted great what i like about good coffee flavor is that earthy rich coffee taste that comes from quality coffee and just being fresh brewed i tested this right after the coffee maker had finished so it was as fresh as it could be i like a little honey and fresh cream in mine and i was sad i only got to have just one cup i had to share with others at home and they all liked it as well i couldn t tell if anything tasted different since it is supposed to be low acid it tasted like regular coffee to me
positive,18/10/21,i like these potato chips they are very tasty and natural i can not find them in russia and so i will order again and again from usa
positive,23/7/21,i remember the old shake n bake commercial from when i was a kid it s shake n bake and i helped and was curious to try it again my sample pouch had enough to coat boneless pork chops each almost a half inch thick each pouch is designed for half inch thick bone in or boneless chops it was quick and easy to coat the chops in a zip lock bag after moistening the meat with water no messy clean up and the pork chops baked up tasty and moist in just a couple minutes more than the recommended minutes i used a thermometer to check for the recommended degrees the flavor of the coating enhanced and did not dominate the flavor of the pork and it was not too salty for a quick weeknight meal i will buy this
positive,8/7/21,i love this item the pork cooks very tender and the shake n bake adds a great flavor rather than eating plain pork a butcher recommends this to his customers a nice break from steak chicken and fish
positive,11/6/21,i have been using shake n bake with my chicken for year but never thought to use it with pork chops until they released the original pork flavor this product is as easy to use as their other products pour the shake n bake into a sealable bag put the pork chops individual shake and then put them in the oven the package says it can be used from four to six pork chops and after using it with four i would not be surprised if i could have been able to coat four more pork chops with one package the taste is so similar to the chicken version there were some bites when i forgot i was eating pork chops and was eating chicken with shake n bake on it much like the chicken version the breading can fall off while cutting but that is really the only negative i can say about the product
positive,25/6/21,i have only praise for this product i give it stars and not for it does not come with a bag it is called shake n bake but there is no bag to shake it in other than that this product is great it is so easy to use i used nice thick boneless pork chops and after shaking the coating fully covered all four it only needs to bake for minutes and the meat does not need to be turned over at all during the cooking i found the coating to be delicious it had a light seasoned taste that was very tasty without overpowering the taste of the pork the coating mix also kept the pork inside tender and moist without getting too crispy on the outside just crispy enough it certainly added just the right flavor to the light taste of the pork i added baked potato peas and a salad and had a very tasty meal i hadn t used shake n bake since i was a kid and then tended to use the chicken more i will definitely use this product on a regular basis now as well as give the chicken a go again highly recommended very easy and quick to use providing a delicious way to cook your pork
positive,2/8/21,i haven t used any shake n bake in years and when i did use it i used the version for chicken so i was curious to see how the product was after all these years i have to admit that i was pleasantly surprised it has a light flavoring tasty but doesn t overpower the flavor of the pork and using the coating kept the meat juicy and it was very easy to use like the name of the product says shake on the coating and bake it s easy to use and tastes good it doesn t get any better than that
positive,11/6/21,we have used the pork pouch on porkt chops and believe it or not we have used it on chicken both were juicy and had a great flavor easy to use without a lot of mess you can t go wrong with shake n bake
positive,9/7/21,love this dip my husband is nuts over it has been eating it quite often since receiving the package all wise products have been fantastic
positive,22/6/21,we all have our vices mine has always been chips specifically bettermade bbq chips so as i m trying to eat healthier i ve tried to find a replacement for that craving i decided to give the popchips a try thinking if they were at least okay i could replace my cravings for them they are better than okay these little guys are full of flavor and crunch and not to sound like a pig but i could eat a half a bag of bettermade in one sitting but these little oz bags even though they are small they fill me up i was shocked i am not kidding i am eating healthier giving in to my craving and getting full from one small bag you cannot go wrong with these even my kids love them i am thrilled to have found a healthy alternative to fatty chips
positive,2/8/21,these are super tasty treats for days when you want something crunchy and salty i didn t find them overly salty as some commented they are very good and i would buy them again and again if the price were lower i got them as a special single serve bags for and would buy again at that price just to keep around as snacks each bag is cals and you actually feel like you are getting a real bag of potato chips yummy
positive,11/6/21,these remind of a product called munchos that i liked a long time ago in regards to flavor great crunch and salt level i wish they packages a bit bigger than the and smaller than oz the is not quite enough and the is too much about oz would be right for my appetite
positive,8/7/21,can t find these in individual size packages locally so this has answered my family s needs have tried most of the varieties but we prefer the original flavor
positive,28/9/21,they are not too salt and vinegary but still have the flavor of it very good tasting crispy
positive,23/8/21,i have tried every variety of popchips and this one is by far my favorite the pepper gives it just the right amount of spice if you love your food to have a little kick to it then you will love these chips
positive,1/8/21,the first time i tried this i thought wow this is great it s as satisfying as eating regular potato chips but sweeter and presumably healthier so had i written the review then i would have given it stars the reason i hesitated was that i took it with me to work and the more i tried it the more i began to question the sweetness there s no question that sweet potatoes are slightly sweet but i felt it only fair to let readers know that they might find this product to be too sweet hence the reason for the stars it is still quite good but if you find sweetness to be cloying you might not like this product for long but all in all i would still recommend it
positive,16/7/21,this syrup is a graet value the bigger more expensive coffee shops use this same syrup to flavor their coffee drinks with additional expense to the consumer bottles are plastic instead of glass for easier shipping to consumer have these auto shipped to my home every three months
positive,2/8/21,great portion control nice that you do not have to keep it in the fridge or freezer i m reordering some right now
positive,11/6/21,caution do not use ice cubes in any zevia soda i am hooked on zevia sodas because their tastes are not heavy each flavored soda seems to have just the right amount of taste once you add ice the taste seems to get watered down zevia is my new soda of choice
positive,26/6/21,this is going to sound like a broken record but this stuff is great my german shepard like the others has horrible food allergies i tried the royal canine venison which was ok but when i tried this my dog who is never that excited about food went crazy he loves the taste his stool is finally solid and his coat has become shinier yes it is expensive but worth it
positive,20/8/21,for fans of black licorice and ouzo oghi this candy is for you very natural tasting and a nice and interesting change from the usual mint my grandmother got a pack and quickly needed me to buy more as we haven t been able to find a store that carries it in town
positive,25/8/21,very fresh and tasty will buy again soon since i ordered it in dec shipping is a little later then estimate better order it earlier
positive,19/10/21,these are really tasty and make a great high protein snack i order them regularly and keep them in my desk drawer they are really filling and taste great
positive,11/6/21,i was happy to see that i could purchase this on amazon previously had to go to our local health food store price is about the same more convenient to come to the house high protein low fat tasty and give a energy boost on intense bike rides or anytime snack when you don t want a carb rush
positive,22/10/21,we were pleasantly surprised at how good these tasted the dv for sodium is so while not excessive we limit ourselves to one at a time
positive,6/8/21,i purchased this for some family members that only like instant coffee they have really enjoyed this and i tried it and found out it has a great taste i would recommend this to anyone that wants a great cup of coffee without having to make a full pot when they only want a cup
positive,24/6/21,nescafe taster s choice instant coffee is as good if not better than the local coffee shops plus nescafe taster s choise cost less than cents per cup ron jones from texas
positive,17/4/21,i ve tried many of the various coffee sticks out there but these are the best tasting not that strong but not like water either perfect for me to me it tastes like the coffee you get at the tgif restaurants so that s why i like it easy and tasty just how i like my women
positive,10/3/21,this jam is amazing great flavor great texture and spreads well on anything might i suggest to put it in some vanilla ice cream for your very own huckleberry ice cream definitely recommend this product now only if i bought more
positive,17/4/21,this cereal product is delicious and is a nice change from so many gluten free cereals that have a cinnamon flavor i really liked the fact that it is a high protein cereal which helps to control blood sugar levels
positive,21/1/21,i gave this product a try since being a gluten and dairy free person limits snacks this tastes really good and its hard just to have a few i will continue to purchase this product
positive,30/1/21,you can add ground turkey to this and it tastes wonderful i wasn t a big ground turkey fan until i tried it with this mix if you don t have ground turkey you can boil a chicken breast with skin in the cups of water then discard the bone and skin and add the mix i ve made it both ways and they re both good i also tried it with ground beef but like it with turkey the best
positive,13/2/21,i don t know what possessed me to try this but am sure glad i did i made it per directions just adding water and a can of tomato paste i wouldn t change a thing i didn t tell my so there was no meat in it and thought it was awesome couldn t believe the very low calories and high fiber a definite keeper and will be a staple in my pantry
positive,15/1/21,my dog loves this food and it has really cut back on the tear staining issues the staining was a big problem and i did quite a bit of research to find a solution i considered a few products that you add to the dog food or come in pill form and several of these apparently work however many of them are actually antibiotics i am not sure it is a good idea to use very often my research led me to antioxidants like blueberries and avoiding wheat to cut back on the tear stains and give him a healthier coat this food is not only grain free but is also loaded with blueberries yes the first ingredient is potato however in firstmate s defense most companies include several non protein ingredients so that they can put them lower down on the list thus making it look like there is more protein than anything else also meat meal is a much more concentrated protein than regular meat somewhere in the range of more concentrated
positive,6/3/21,this was their first product it is filtered hence the clear color and while does not have the same nutrients as their unfiltered product for taste it can t be beat i would recommend to those trying to get off soft drinks and something marginally better
positive,8/6/21,this tea is amazing i cannot believe the price the price i paid is less than half of what other companies charge and this tea is delicious i love it fast delivery too great job
positive,7/1/21,this is a quality rock candy product and a very large amount for the price i would deffinately buy this product again if needed purchased as a gift and the person was more than thrilled
positive,17/4/21,every year for the holidays i buy my brother a pack of these chai tea packets for him to use at university he loves them
positive,10/3/21,can you really ever go wrong with the most trusted name in oatmeal in fact can you ever really go wrong with oatmeal it s pretty hard to screw up oatmeal the only factor at play here is if you like the flavor i really enjoy oatmeal but i hate the effort that it can take compared to getting a bowl of cereal these instant packs take virtually no time and you don t have to mess with extra ingredients like brown sugar and maple extract etc they come in many different flavors and if you like oatmeal and you like brown sugar this is a quick and easy way to satisfy your morning hunger
positive,14/1/21,the taste is great the shipment came in fast i love it and so does my entire family the beans are on the smaller side but it does not matter to us
positive,24/5/21,we have a standing order for the beef sticks but always run out before hand and must order sooner love them
positive,14/10/21,my husband complained that split peas didn t have any taste anymore he really likes these and said they taste like split peas used to taste seem to be very good quality
positive,7/2/21,this is great convenience to have on my counter next to my keurig and kcups i really think this is a great value too
positive,29/3/21,this tea has lots of flavors i first started loving chai tea about years ago i have tried many of the boxed liquid teas and i do like them i have preferred the brand einstein bagles uses but since i have a starbucks close by have grown to like the one they use as well my favorite is the masala tea made my a local indian restaurant this most closely approximates that i am still trying to replicate it but for now this is the best i can do i really like this tea as a bonus if i forget to empty the basket when i leave work when i get in the next day the whole area smells great
positive,17/4/21,it s tasty although they say a medley of oranges mingled with piquant leaves i also enjoy it because it s caffeine free good for chilly nights
positive,10/3/21,this is a great tasting tea the taste is not too strong or overpowering and not too weak i will be purchasing more
positive,10/7/21,i love a good strong cup of morning coffee and this one comes as close to perfect as one can i usually set my machine to make a mug of coffee the first cup i had of this brew tasted just a little stronger that my usual one i then dropped the cup size down one notch made a second cup and found what i was looking for tried my usual coffees with the smaller cup they did not compare to the rich aroma fine taste that i m now getting with revv
positive,27/1/21,anyone shopping for chives in the grocery store knows how expensive chives are i m almost surprised restaurants don t charge extra for them these chives are a steal compared to the grocery and taste as good as mccormick s at probably a of the price also the shipping was very fast i would buy again without a doubt
positive,1/6/21,great tasting pecans though it would be great if they were larger packing would have been better in boxes instead cos quite a few were turned to pecan dust i would buy again though since they are really good to eat as a snack or cereal topping
positive,20/8/21,this gluten free bar is much better than most a rich combination of just what it says fruit and nuts however the unit description is incorrect it is not boxes but one box of eight bars
positive,14/8/21,this fruit and nut bar by kind is very very tasty travels well even in the heat no problem with melting or not being able to handle due to the heat nuts do require chewing so would not recommend them to anyone with chewing issues otherwise they are superb
positive,21/4/21,this is a great cereal i could not find it for over a year i was on amazon and just happen to search for the item and they had it i am so happy i can still buy this product
positive,1/4/21,if you like popcorn you have to try this we have an counter top popcorn machine and it work s great try it you ll love it
positive,17/4/21,this popcorn rivals that of movie theaters even the so call people selling movie theater popcorn cannot hold a candle to this popcorn
positive,10/3/21,we have been using this product for over a year now and that should speak volumes because we are a popcorn loving bunch the convenience of having everything measured and ready to go at a minute s notice is great i have a popcorn machine in the media room and so we love to munch popcorn while watching movies we feel we are at a theater eating the real deal i will continue to purchase even though it isn t the most figure friendly popcorn taste outweighs the waist tee he
positive,22/4/21,i would say this is the best tasting popcorn have eaten it to me is better than movie thearte popcorn it has the right mixed of salt and oil to give it a really good flavor
positive,25/4/21,i have a waring pro and this stuff is fantastic it is salty and buttery and tastes like movie theater popcorn some complain it doesn t all pop that s because some of the kernals are thrown out of the kettle while the others pop it always fills the tray that comes with my popper all the way up i love it
positive,1/4/21,we use these popcorn packs for our party rental business we can keep enough in stock they are easy for our customers to use and taste great
positive,30/6/21,great taste and easy to use i did find that if you let the package soak in hot water for a few minutes before use it makes the oil come out of the package easier
positive,1/3/21,this popcorn tastes great its so easy just cut off the top and pour in the contents i ll for sure be buying more of this popcorn
positive,29/1/21,this popcorn tastes great the only complaint i have is that it is way too salty and we like salty all we do is pour out a tiny bit of salt before adding it to the kettle and it s perfect
positive,17/4/21,i use this with a whirly pop and it is a great combination as others have said tastes and smells just like theater popcorn due to the use of coconut oil very few un popped kernels and total cooking time is just about minutes on medium heat i just dump the whole packet into the popper and start cranking i don t think it matters if you dump only the oil first even though it is pretty thick but once heated it thins out i will not use microwave popcorn anymore the taste can t be compared to this no matter what brand you buy we have a large family and have tried all sorts of brands of microwave popcorn and none come close in taste to this i would estimate that one oz pack makes just short of oz microwave popcorn bags update ok here is the scoops on this product i have tried to duplicate the taste by buying coconut oil popcorn and flavacol salt flavoring cooked it exactly the same the taste is close but nope not as good as this product from great northern of course the final price is cheaper if you mix it yourself but the end taste is not as good i have tried the act ii buttery flavor popping oil instead of the coconut oil and still the taste is not the same as this i often use whirl butter topping on my popcorn which tastes fantastic but these bags from great northern don t need a thing as far as topping trust me you will not go back to microwave popcorn again while cooking you will swear you are in the movie theater
positive,10/3/21,got a popcorn machine as a gift for a basement family room have tried a few different popcorn oil products and been disappointed with the taste probably a little pricier to buy everything prepackaged this way but the best flavor we ve found very happy with our purchase will definitely buy again
positive,30/5/21,bigelow vanilla caramel tea is the most delicious tea i have ever tasted i use silk soy creamer with the tea to add an extra vanilla taste i make my cup pot of tea every morning using bags of the bigelow caramel tea with bags of bigelow decaffeinated english tea i like my tea slightly decaffeinated i wish you made a decaffeinated caramel vanilla tea because the taste would probably be mind blowing
positive,28/9/21,chewy tasty just the right amount of brazil nuts and love using the little hammer to break apart the toffee
positive,6/5/21,this tea is really quite good it is a quality black tea with a subtle cinnamon flavoring definitely one of my favorites as with many food items sold on amazon i would recommend trying a single box from your local retailer if you can find it before committing to a whole six pack once you know you like it however the value of this offering really can t be beat anywhere
positive,20/4/21,this is hands down the best gluten free bread mix on the market if you re on a gluten free diet and make your own bread you have to try this
positive,20/4/21,i really enjoyed this product it s very easy to mix and bake the taste and texture are very close to that of a wheat flour based bread
positive,21/4/21,i like these bars but would rank them second to the think thin peanut butter variety those are great these are very good both offer up a good amount of protein for people who need more in their diet such as vegetarians
positive,2/5/21,what i enjoy most with this variety pack is the varieties i don t get bored with just flavour and there are some flavors i cannot find locally
positive,18/12/19,outstanding product the greattea gives me a warm comfotable feeling and makes my senses come alive the bags are quite large that s a good thing because i get a bigger cup of tea with full flavor just fantastic
positive,19/1/20,first time we have used chebe produce we loved it has great taste and easy to make will buy again
positive,19/1/20,awesomely tasty cereal cocoa beach is my favorite all time and also by kashi kid cereal for adults schweet
positive,31/3/20,i loved this cereal so did all the family we just can t have it any more due to dietary restrictions too much sugar would love to have in the house again
positive,18/12/19,this is a great bbq sauce that even our kids really like a little kick but not spicy great alternative for those looking for a low carb product without chemical sweeteners
positive,13/10/19,this is genius i purchase angel hair first and after that bought a big box of angel hair and fettuccine the product is amazing don t get fooled by all these negative reviews if you like asian food you probably already know that their pasta doesn t taste like american european kind it has a different texture and taste so these noodles taste exactly like the ones you order at big bowl the comments about the smell are ridiculous how many raw uncooked food smells good are you kidding me for instance i love steamed broccoli but it smells bad while steaming please follow the instructions rinse in cold water for at least seconds and boil for one minute dry in paper towels if you don t follow instructions you will ruin any food even your most favorite since the pasta is calories i finally could indulge myself with a really good pasta sauce no low fat anymore or some seafood alfredo the possibilities are endless please note that the noodles even better the next day since they easily absorb all flavors absolutely delicious and guilt free
positive,28/9/20,people who complain about smell need to read and educate themselves yes when you open it smells that s how they are packed all you have to do is rinse yes read instructions then i throw in a skillet for a bit usually with garlic and seasoning because i did find hard to pat dry if you throw in a skillet for a few it takes the step where you pat dry away there is no smell just eat however you want just don t write negative comments if you don t read the site or directions the site alone will answer any questions quickly m
positive,16/11/20,i was having trouble locating apple chips locally and was happy to find these at a good price amazon i love the chicken salad a chain restaurant sells that have apple chips on top and wanted to try to replicate the recipe at home these work well and taste great the only issue i have is that they really aren t the healthy option i thought they contain oil and sugar bringing the calorie content to per bag it is better to eat an apple but these are a mighty tasty snack
positive,27/2/20,i love these biscottis they are calories each and taste wonderful because there are so few calories these falls under a diet product which means they aren t cheap however i got them here for about less than the other vendor i used online
positive,26/2/21,justin s individual nut butter packs are delicious and perfect for back packing trips i bring them every time without dissatisfaction highly recommended product
positive,18/12/19,i ve tried so many different jasmine teas and this one is my favorite there are some i just do not like this brand has a wonderful flavor i have been drinking this for about years now it is a good deal if you buy this from amazon on auto ship you can t beat the price
positive,19/1/20,this tea is very refreshing and i love the mint flavor i use it for ice tea i especially like this brand of tea
positive,13/9/20,i love these bars this is a smaller company producing an extremely high quality product you get what you pay for i m glad to pay for such a great product and will continue to purchase these thank you for such an outstanding product
positive,10/7/20,these tomatoes seem very soft for dried tomatoes which is great they are also very flavorful i ve been using them in a coconut curry and i don t even bother soaking them to soften them i just throw of them five halves in the vita mix with everything but the coconut milk blend for a minute and then simmer together with the coconut milk delicious i originally purchased these because i had some raw food recipes that called for quite a bit of dried tomatoes and these seem nearly perfect for that the thing that makes them less than perfect to me is that they aren t organic but pounds is still so much i gave one bag to my boyfriend who thinks i m weird for giving him a pound of dried tomatoes but once i give him the coconut curry recipe he ll be thanking me oh and the bags zip lock shut after they re opened which is a nice touch
positive,14/4/21,i can t say if it gives sustained energy as i just had my first pack i will say they were crisp and tasted great i m always looking for portable energy food that is not low calorie these are about calories per pack and since i take snacks like this hiking backpacking that s a good thing so far i really like them perhaps i ll update after i take them hiking and see how they hold up
positive,24/4/21,if you love chocolate and fruits this is the product for you i have just finished my first bag and i still can t get over the taste the candies are bite size and even though i hate using cliches you simply can t get enough of them the chocolate doesn t taste bitter but it s not too sweet either and the pomegranate enhances the flavor with a slightly sour touch overall just like those commercials say your mouth will thank you
positive,28/4/21,bought these at costco for a few cents less and figure they will either double in price or never be in stock again glad to know they are here on amazon they are addictingly good the deep dark chocolate flavor is haunting i was looking for choc cherries but these will do nicely
positive,12/7/21,i bought this chocolate for my parents as a gift they loved it it has a little sour taste and good quality of chocolate
positive,18/12/19,this makes a good quick and sustaining meal with flatbread or rice we have found that adding liquid such as milk converts it to a very tasty soup i could undoubtedly make something better with fresh ingredients but that is not always feasible and for convenience and reliability the koi line is hard to beat
positive,19/1/20,i found this product at a little tiny store i bought it figuring what the heck my hair is damaged and a little bit fried this product gave me shine it calmed most of my frizzies and a wonderful subtle scent to go with it i love this product the only down side is its a little bit hard to find
positive,28/4/21,this is pretty good tea i use it to make iced tea i will usually use two of these tea bags with a few of the cheap plain tea bags in order to make mango tea that doesn t taste like mango juice good stuff at a great price
positive,8/8/20,received my order of honey pepper jerky a couple days ago the jerky is sweet and the pepper is very good without being overwhelming i generally prefer jerky that is very dry and chewy but i really enjoyed the taste and texture of this product i would not hesitate to order again or recommend to others
positive,22/5/21,this is a very nice hot cereal the five grains give it a somewhat nutty flavor and a more complex texture than regular oatmeal and it s quick to cook on the stove at only about minutes i like adding wyman s frozen blueberries and strawberries i add those when the oatmeal is done cooking but the heat is still on so the frozen fruit can thaw a bit as well as a bit of maple syrup and milk mmm mm mm
positive,18/12/19,is this the healthiest breakfast no of course not but does it taste great yes i have a minute commute and drinking my chocolate protein shake makes the drive much more enjoyable and cuts down on my getting ready time in the morning at home i have one for breakfast every day and my husband has one for lunch every day we love them i prefer the chocolate and my husband drinks the vanilla and strawberry neither of us love the dark chocolate definitely try these
positive,19/1/20,this is a tasty treat with a thin layer of sugary jelly in the middle no oozing jelly or anything as i have initially thought for pcs i think this item is too expensive and would not buy again
positive,3/8/20,i am quite fond of these bars they aren t full of nasty ingredients like most commercial cereal bars the only downside is that they don t fill me up at all they are good as a snack but i can t eat these for breakfast without being hungry soon afterwards
positive,29/7/21,great way to keep fruit in your diet if you follow weight watcher this is a good snack for you three point and you get more fruit in your diet
positive,8/7/20,we use this as a base for sauces and in soups and other meals its very flavorful and delicious its even a good price with subscribe and save would buy again
positive,13/4/21,this sauce is awesome i went on a month long quest for the next best table hot sauce i read a million reviews from different hot sauce sites only to order product after product and finding it flavorless under powered over powered or simply disgusting this is the most versatile hot sauce out there it makes a fantastic table sauce as well as an excellent marinade for some wings it showcases the cayenne and garlic without making the cayenne or garlic so much that it s unwelcome it is an immediate medium burn and should satisfy anyone seeking a nice well rounded table sauce by the way these independent hot sauce reviews non amazon were hard to go through a lot of them are video reviews why do people reviewing hot sauce think we want to see them eating hot sauce on a cracker over a crappy webcam and then they review the sauce while continuing to munch on a mouthful of hot cracker gross
positive,20/2/21,i discovered ambrosia custard while in ireland and absolutely love the subtle taste and smooth texture ambrosia is a great light dessert when looking for something with minimal sugar and the taste better than birds i am going to i would like to be able to purchase it in the aseptic boxes sold in the uk but am happy it s available at amazon
positive,9/12/20,i add this to sugarfree cappuchino and it tastes great it tastes just like the brands in the gas stations when i get a cappuccino there
positive,1/4/21,i ordered this jerky because it was the best price per pound and i had never had brown sugar jerky it was surprisingly good the jerky was not too dry and didn t have an overly sweet taste i would recommend this as an option on road trips or as a snack that increases your daily protein intake i have even added this to amazon s program that automatically sends it to you each month i definitely got my money s worth
positive,25/2/21,i used these as a healthier option than chocolate for some cake pops the yogurt is strong and tasty i would buy again
positive,18/12/19,i got these from the grocery store when i couldn t have milk because of the baby i had to have some chocolate this is some really tasty chocolate i mean real good i can have milk now but i still buy these love them
positive,14/10/20,this cereal has no artificial sweetners is high in fiber but has a great taste a hard combination to find
positive,10/3/21,i am becoming one of goya s biggest fans i had seen these on the shelves and they were really inexpensive but i opted for a test can of vienna sausages instead they were so good i went back the next day to get this tin of sardines they have a great sardine flavor not fishy or oily at all and the tomato sauce is thick and rich i am of the opinion that sardines make everything taste better and these go great just on a regular saltine great for snacks or a pack lunch or road trips i ll probably edit this review sometime in the next month to give this product stars because i see addiction ahead lol
positive,15/8/21,this has been my staple breakfast cereal for a couple of years now i love the taste
positive,27/4/21,very delicious cookies both sweet and crunchy i got these for christmas gifts to go along with tea i think the receivers will really enjoy these
positive,24/1/21,i ve purchased the lemon raspberry and shortbread cookies and liked them all what i like the most about the brand of cookies is that they are not too sweet perfect for my taste
positive,14/7/20,new look but same taste a wonderfull cup of tea whit black cherry berry flavor it s a must to have
positive,5/6/21,this does not taste at all like cough syrup as the other reviewer stated this is the best gum out there and i highly recommend it i am not a plant i live in austin tx and bought a pack of this in san antonio i just ordered a box on amazon this and the lemon are the best flavors orbit makes john
positive,9/7/21,my cat loves it my neighbour s cat loves it just be aware that feeding fish product exclusively is unhealthy for your cat i think aside from this pack you should also get the chicken etc pack for a balanced diet
positive,5/6/21,great taste great taste dissolves well etc highly recommend i can sometimes buy at kroger i usually add to more wter than recommended thanks hansen
positive,25/7/21,i use this powder to make the jamba juice equivalent of the matcha green tea blast it does a great job in reproducing the taste i d recommend this supplier
positive,13/7/21,best tasting agave so far and i ve tried many of the popular store carried brands
positive,9/7/21,i never realized this but the salt and mineral concentration of seawater is different in each part of the world and therefore the taste of sea salt varies based on where it comes from to me french gray sea salt is delicious the flavor is more gentile than regular salt and has a slightly tangy taste with just a hint of minerals the price may seem high compared to table salt but amazon s price is low compared to other places i ve bought it definitely worth it in my opinion one thing to note is that this sea salt is very moist so it doesn t work well in a grinder or shaker sometimes i ll serve it in a salt cellar but generally i just keep it in a glass jar by the stove for cooking and use regular salt at the table
positive,8/7/21,this is a fantastic product my bull terrier was capable of spitting out a pill no matter what it was inserted into peanut butter steak chicken hot dogs you name it i ve tried it now he patiently waits while i get his pill ready and gulps it down absolutely amazing i will never be without this product
positive,15/7/21,i read the bad reviews on this coffee and am glad that i didn t let them dissuade me from buying this product i like the natural fusions vanilla coffee by starbucks and this one is just as good it s a pleasing coffee with subtle caramel undertones i ll buy it again in the future if it s available
positive,6/7/21,my name is patrick and i am an american shorthair of indeterminate age and semi discriminating tastes my human asked me to write this review for the instinct raw boost bites chicken formula she got through the vine program because she is unable to sample them herself i gobbled up the portion my human gave me right away as far as i m concerned these deserve two paws up my housemate tiger also enjoyed the bites she has a more discriminating palate than me but she liked these just fine we think they compare favorably to other feline brand snacks like pounce and temptations each piece is larger than say a pounce pellet which our human broke into smaller pieces so one or two make a more than adequate snack according to my human the package says that the treats are grain free and are made from minimally processed freeze dried raw ingredients ingredients include chicken turkey vegetables like butternut squash and broccoli ground flaxseed salmon oil and mixed tocopherols with citric acid i m not entirely sure what all that stuff means but i would recommend the bites to other cats who enjoy chicken flavored snacks that are meant for cats
positive,13/8/21,much more buttery taste than all other light butter popcorns by far the best light popcorn i have tasted
positive,5/6/21,some of the best coffee i ve ever had smooth and full of flavor it does get a little bitter if you weaken it too much but any coffee will
positive,9/7/21,i need a filler and this was on sale at the moment for for it s worth it add water chicken potatoes carrots and mumble jumpbo result is good and tastety individual package serve about meals and it can not be save for long after opening so plan carefully
positive,17/6/21,love this stuff i bought it because it was cheap but it tastes great it actually comes from india and the ingredients on the package are all things i can pronounce and recognize i ve been eating indian food for a long time and this was my first successful attempt to make it at home love it
positive,31/8/21,simply put these packets are easy to use and yield a good result when you want indian in a pinch i modified the recipe on the packet by adding chopped onion and some leftover roasted potatoes making the result more of a complete meal the salt content is a little high but overall the quality is excellent for a concentrate
positive,7/8/21,i received my two boxes of coffee quickly in and in perfect condition this is the best deal i have found for this and will be purchasing coffee this way in the future
positive,6/9/21,i ve been drinkin this coffee for about three months and in my opinion it is the best coffee i ve ever tasted i used to wake up with headaches almost every morning and now the aches are gone i have lost weight about pounds pounds and what i really like about this coffee is that if i don t drink it for a couple of days i will not get those i need cafeine headaches in the morning
positive,5/6/21,i gave half of the pack to my friend visiting from tokyo we both love them although it would be nice if they came in bigger cans
positive,9/7/21,these almonds are so yummy i ordered them online because both of my stores were always out walmart and target is where i get them i go through these very quickly i like spicy foods so to me they are not hot but just right
positive,19/6/21,love the taste not to hot but a little tangy price is good and really good service
positive,5/9/21,these almonds just have a great flavor just the right amount of heat it s hard to stop eating them good thing my wife is here to stop me
positive,10/10/21,i love the strength and taste of pg tips i grew up in england drinking this tea and when i came to america in i just could not drink the weak tasteless tea that was being sold on the supermarket shelves i have introduced my wife and friends to this tea they now can t drink anything else
positive,29/9/21,i like this flavor a lot when i make this i add about cup of regular old fashioned oats it makes it not quite so sweet and i like the texture of the non instant oats i just add water and cook in microwave for minutes i have no idea what someone said meant about the fake flavoring smell lingering for a week i didn t have any problem with the smell
positive,11/9/21,i am very happy with this product it tastes really yummy and doesn t have lots of extra ingredients i love the variety in the ella products and that my baby is getting lots of healthy foods in one meal also it is very easy to just squeeze it onto a spoon to feed no mess
positive,5/6/21,this is an great green tea choice if you like a blend of different teas i thought it was well balanced and tasted great overall
positive,9/7/21,i ve tried other root beer popsicles before but they were not as close to being as good as a w s it was very easy i just put them in the freezer and then after dinner my family eats them
positive,26/8/21,this cheese had a great smoked flavor not over powering as some can be it worked very well with must of my grilled recipes
positive,11/9/21,these almonds make a good snack the cocoa coating isn t sweet in fact it s vaguely bitter and it isn t overpowering the nuts themselves were good and fresh my wife and i both liked them on the other hand my daughter said i don t hate them but i don t love them either save these for the adults they d work well with red wine or sweet cocktails
positive,11/9/21,i like these like the packaging too these are not chocolate dipped but cocoa powdered and the flavor is cocoa not chocolate very sweet probably good because a few go along way very flavorful
positive,15/9/21,these are exactly what they say they are cocoa roasted almonds people expecting an overly sweet chocolate covered almond are going to be disappointed they do contain artificial sweeteners which seem to be one of the biggest complaints but i d also counter that with the argument that normal chocolate covered almonds have it too overall they re sweet but not overtly so a good snack for people looking for a slightly less sugar loaded version of a sweet almond
positive,5/6/21,love this sauce taste is perfect i use this sauce with so many food but mostly with macaroni cheese so go for it best sauce
positive,9/7/21,love the taste of this sauce we have been using this for over a year great price good quality using this makes the pasta very yummy a great buy
positive,14/9/21,i purchase several types of snacks for my hubby and i but find this product to be one of our favorites it has lots of sesame sticks which we love also the idea that four packages are included in the price is a good buy i would definitely buy again
positive,29/9/21,my husband loves these granola bars he uses them to satisfy his sweet tooth and his chocolate cravings and i don t mind because they re a lot better than eating a candy bar the price is a decent savings from what i ve seen in stores but i haven t been able to find this particular kind locally anymore so i ll continue to buy from here
positive,10/7/21,highly recommend this flavor pack absolutely love each of them my and year olds love them so glad i went with these vs the other brand
positive,1/3/20,love the hawaiian shaved ice flavors and so do my kids they have a rich not watered down taste that you can t beat
positive,28/7/20,this is by far the best product on the market i have purchased this item several times and have never been disappointed one time my lab got to the package before me and he enjoyed it as well but seemed to prefer the cherry the most hawaiian shaved ice syrup is awsome its number one at my house for the kids and sometimes my dog
positive,28/7/20,we had a yard sale and sold snow cones with hawaiian shaved ice snow cone syrups it was a huge hit i especially liked the choice of flavors i will definetly be ordering more as we will be having several more yard sales before the season is over
positive,10/11/19,we decided to try our hand at snow cone making this summer since the money we spent last year at our local stand could have bought a small house this was our first purchase of syrup and we are so pleased with the quality it tastes exactly the same as what we have enjoyed in the past the banana is delish and my kids have loved every flavor we have tried thus far wonderful product
positive,1/3/20,as a hot drink this made a great alternative to tea it s spicy and somehow refreshing it tastes mostly natural and it s said to be but i did not have retail packaging nor are the ingredients listed online so i have no idea what is actually in the product and i would want to know for sure before buying very much of it i also would like to try it in carbonated water to see if one can make a more naural less sugary ginger ale
positive,3/8/19,this ginger lemon drink is a foil packet of instant powder that only needs a cup of boiling water to make a hot tasty very flavorful drink with the honey already included it is excellent if you feel a scratchy throat or sniffle coming on i think you will like it as much as i did
positive,6/2/21,i love ginger especially the crystalized ginger candy and this beverage tasted just like those candies to me i tried it hot and cold i love it both ways but maybe the cold a bit more how nice it would be to take some of these packets on any type of trip that would get me sick from motion sickness it tastes so good that i d drink it just because but to know it s good for my digestion makes it all the better if you like the taste of ginger you ll love this drink tastes so natural and good
positive,13/5/21,i received this product as part of the amazon vine program excellent taste and wonderful to take with you i get just order some hot water at any restaurant and bring my own pack
positive,1/3/20,milo was my daily equivalent of coffee back in singapore but now that i moved to the us i was shocked to find that the grocery stores near where i live does not sell this drink so i was glad to find it on amazon and it tastes as great reminds me of home too i hope it gets restocked soon though
positive,28/7/20,i liked this a lot and will keep this in my tea stock the bergamot is strong and compliments the full bodied earl grey tea well
positive,13/5/20,very pleased with the smooth not too weak slightly bolder taste of this yuban dark roast right where i like the taste of my coffee at a price point that i can enjoy as well low acidity too perfect
positive,26/3/21,very tasty our family loves this soda i especially like that it s all natural no hfcs it s very light and fruity and not too sweet it has a very pleasant light pink color
positive,29/8/19,i love coconut and i love cashews if i could eat only those to things for the rest of my life i would die happy this is a great bar if you enjoy coconut flavor cashew flavor
positive,7/2/21,well i m just going to go on faith that the carbs carbs i don t have a lab at my house and it tastes great
positive,14/10/21,so far i like this cherry juice best i was expecting it to be thinner and watered down compared to the concentrate i had been mixing tart is smart concentrate cup per qt of water which i believe is what they suggest but this tastes much better and stronger perhaps tastes better because it tastes stronger to me the tart cherry juice works better than glucosamine for me my knees creak far less and i am much more limber when i wake up i can t say anything about sleeping better as i slept fine before i started drinking cherry juice
positive,7/8/20,it works and the taste is very pleasing i will order again to get through those occasional sleepy afternoons works faster than a cup of coffee
positive,1/3/20,my months old enjoys all earth s best products so i decided to get this one too he really likes it although i think his favorite is apples and apricots like all the other products i bought from this brand i wasn t disappointed
positive,28/7/20,the best coconut water it is much better in the bottle than the paper box i would recommend it it even tastes great at room temperature
positive,14/9/21,the taste is really good i do love coconut but this has just enough balance where the coconut does not overpower it helps with my heartburn as well
positive,2/5/20,so healthy and good for you and it tastes great i know that s a personal view but this is my favorite of all the coconut waters i have tried no added sugar and so not too sweet the pack of six x oz cartons are great value too
positive,14/7/21,i took a few sips of this stuff and couldn t help but wonder what all the reviews were for to me the taste kind of reminds me of those chocolatey breakfast shakes however by the end of the bottle my opinion was completely changed it has a very good sweet chocolate taste even better this stuff is killer for hangovers i was walking around with a headache and general malaise all day picked up one of these drank it and within an hour or two my headache and general unease was completely gone i m sold on this product
positive,18/7/19,zico probably has the best taste of the coconut water brands i ve tried this passion fruit flavor is great refreshing not too sweet i m not a fan of the unflavored kinds i ve tried zico s mango but prefer the passion fruit over it
positive,1/3/20,very tasty and filling if you are watching your diet it has a lot of flavor and satisfies that craving for chocolate
positive,13/6/20,not sure where all the bad reviews are comming from i bought two cases to take camping with me the first bottle tasted just as good as the last
positive,10/3/20,came quickly tastes good and pops well i like the separate flavor package for easier use i m ordering a second case
positive,14/5/19,these banana nut bars are soft and chewy with a nice banana bread flavor they go great with a cup of coffee for a quick light breakfast or an afternoon snack
positive,19/10/20,i received a sample from influenster and i have to say these are my new favorite breakfast bar i love banana nut bread and these have that same flavor great for on the go and they are healthy for you too i keep one in my purse in case i ever need a quick snack definitely recommend these
positive,1/3/20,i recently tried the quaker banana nut bread cereal bar and was pleasantly surprised from first bite i felt like i was really eating banana nut bread and it was simply delicious
positive,28/7/20,quaker soft baked cereal bar banana nut bread are great tasting and perfect for on the go they are a great healthy snack and a better alternate instead of s candy bar or something high in sugars this a perfect snack for the whole family
positive,7/3/20,these quaker banana bread bars are so tasty and i just love that they are low calorie giving me a guilt free snack
positive,4/8/20,i was a little wary trying these because i don t like dense chewy bars that hurt your jaw to eat and that s what i really thought this was going to be i couldn t have been more wrong i bit into it and got a crunch from the almonds on top and i had to check the ingredients soy crisps inside i received one bar as a sample and went out and bought an entire box that same week however even though on the package it says that it tastes great heated up i didn t like it heated up it lost the crunch and seemed to become that dreaded chewy bar i still give this product stars though because heating it up is definitely not something that you have to do
positive,26/12/19,this bar is sooooo good it said to heat it up to taste better but i just ate it out of the pack it was very filling for me it does taste just like a banana nut muffin this bar was moist and soft my husband loved the bar as well i would take this bar on the go or just have as a snack it was filling with a cup of coffee i will be purchasing more yummy
positive,28/3/21,i tried the banana nut bread soft baked cereal bar and it was so good if you like banana flavored anything you will love this this is perfect for breakfast on the go for people like me who end up eating on their commute or for an afternoon snack it s sweet enough to satisfy a sweet tooth it reminds me of a healthier version of toaster strudel the best part is that is contains protein b vitamins and fiber i can t wait to try the cinnamon pecan
positive,6/2/20,i bought these as a way to supplement my meals as well as get more fiber and protein first of all these bars are fairly nutritious they are made of natural ingredients and whole grains just like the cereal each bar contains g of fiber and g of protein considering most people in the united states don t get enough fiber that is a very decent amount previously i was eating the fiber one bars oats chocolate count boxes pack of while you get g more fiber in those bars you only get g of protein the kashi bars are made of better and more nutritious ingredients and they taste better as well each bar has only calories but they are very filling due to the fiber and protein although a bar made of brown rice and oats doesn t sound very tasty these are some of the best bars i ve tried as the name implies they re not chewy but not too crunchy either below is the main nutritional info calories total fat g sat fat g sodium mg carbs g fiber g protein g
positive,25/4/21,after doing some of research both taste testing and strictly from a nutritional standpoint these kashi golean bars in chocolate caramel seemed to rise to the top of my list there were definitely some bars that offered more protein or fiber or even less calories or fat but overall this seemed to be the best all around for me it comes in with calories less than most of competitors grams of fat less than a lot of competitors grams of protein more on par with many of its competitors and grams of fiber more than a lot of competitors oh yeah and they taste pretty awesome as well
positive,3/8/20,my husband worked for this oreintal family who gave him a oz package of noh hawaiian iced tea he raved on how good it was i did not believe him until i actually tried it ummmm great cool taste and refreshing ice tea i would definetely recommend
positive,15/4/19,the aroma is just super the flavor is great also i m using it to make iced tea but i m sure it s good hot also loved by everyone who has tried it has a very mild lemon taste well balanced flavor
positive,9/3/18,nice assortment one cheese got molded before opening about days after arrival i gourmet replaced it promptly nice grouping for a wine tasting party
positive,18/5/18,don t be fooled buy the calorie count on this product most people consider low calorie products to be less filling i m surprised at this tasty and filling meal in a can i purchased this item on a whim and glad that i did will purchase again for sure
positive,9/3/18,quite flavorful it jump starts my day certainly recommend it i like a stout cup of coffee and would definately reorder it again
positive,27/2/18,these are one of the best tasting potato chips that i have tasted nice and crunchy a little thicker than other chips and just the right amount of salt while these are certainly not a health food the current packaging boasts that they have less fat than regular chips the package also boasts no artificial flavors no preservatives no message no trans fats made with all natural ptotatoes and seasonings one serving has g fat of which only g is saturated fat mg sodium g sugar and g protein for potato chips that is pretty good shop for price the printed price on a oz bag is and i can get these for less on sale at my local supermarket
positive,20/2/18,went to italy this past summer and again in september so i became addicted to expresso and ordered about worth of pods when i got back and i really really enjoyed this one my father and grandfather also like it born and raised in italy will be ordering again
positive,22/3/18,i just brewed my first cup and the aroma and flavor both speak of autumn and harvest i love the flavor i would highly recommend this herbal tea
positive,9/2/18,i bought this brand without having tried it beforehand because i couldn t find any mulling spices in bags in the local grocery stores last month and i was ready for some apple juice and mulling spices it tastes very good much the same as another brand a friend shared with me last year i have tried other instant brands but didn t care for them these are perfect for me although the amount i had to buy here on amazon was really more than what i wanted
positive,7/12/17,these are pretty good some of the individually wrapped pieces must have tiny holes as some of the cookies are no longer crisp and fresh but for the price they are pretty great most of them are good
positive,24/5/19,these are very good crackers with a very italian cheesy taste all boxes had quite a few crushed at the bottom of the boxes bags bags inside the boxes i liked them much better than just the regular cheddar ones
positive,9/3/18,this is a very good rice and i will be ordering more good flavor and it is always a surprise at a dinner party
positive,18/5/18,i don t eat chips often but when i do these are some of my favorites they have all the flavor and texture of traditional tortilla chips but it is the subtle lime flavoring that makes them special the lime flavoring appears to be a seasoning that has been sprinkled on some chips seem to have minimal flavor and i find myself looking for those with the most still none of them have quite enough for my tastes i wish that these chips had more than just a hint of lime
positive,23/3/18,crust is a little bland but the middle is great i wish it were in stock more often
positive,8/9/20,these are the best quick boil udons i ve ever had the noodles are just right and the soup is pretty good you can also skip the soup base and add your own stuff i like adding tofu and tempura fish balls with my udon if you re fortunate enough to have a ranch market or nijiya market nearby save yourself some money and buy the udon there since they re sold for only cents a pack
positive,23/2/18,this is an awesome product dissapointed only by cans being dented they were usable though great buy compared to stores
positive,18/7/20,best tasting green tea around a bit pricey i tried yogi green tea because it was cheaper it was good but not a smooth and rich tasting i will stick with traditional medicinal from now on
positive,14/6/18,taste like fruit like the texture kind of like gummy bears love the calories great snack and easy to travel with had these before and this is nd order
positive,2/11/18,i ve wanted to find a stevia sweetened soda for a long time but i don t like typical colas or lemon lime soft drinks i had hoped this would taste a little more like that other well known dr drink but to be honest it just doesn t i guess my slight disappointment with that difference led me to knock off a star in my rating all in all however it s a good flavor bit of a cherry with a hint of citrus
positive,14/10/18,this is one of zevia s more successful flavors it s more reminiscent of the flavor of dr pepper than a clone but it still tastes very good i don t notice any kind of aftertaste i ve bought this on its own before and will again it s one of my favorite flavors
positive,6/4/20,my only complaint is that on the bottom of the package the expiration date is i don t think that s correct i made several cups of tea before i noticed it and figured that since i hadn t had any adverse effects either it was incorrect or it didn t matter it tastes refreshing and smells great the combination of coconut and green tea is awesome
positive,9/3/18,these are very good not too sweet like most fig newton type bars and not gritty like some high fiber or high protein bars we eat them for afterschool snacks or breakfast on the run
positive,18/5/18,these candies are small which i like since i don t want to scarf down a candy bar that has calories these candies are about calories each the flavor is a mix between coffee and cream which you already know but the sugar content is not so large as to make you feel the candies are nothing but sugar you can eat of these candies a day and have no guilt the hardness of the candies is great because they last awhile and unlike other candies they don t stick to your teeth and torture you for minutes geeh i m sounding old but i can t buy the junk from a vending machine at work and enjoy it and most candies are huge in size and calories so these candies seem to be ideal
positive,7/3/18,this is the only protein powder that i have used that tastes great even mixed with just cold water and a shaker
positive,24/1/19,the product taste great for a meal replacement powder this works for me as i work and go to school fulltime and have less time cooking or preparing food it satisfy my appetite for hours
positive,27/2/19,love this stuff st try used shaker cup to mix would recommend using electric wand mixer to create milkshake effect and the chocolately taste is yummy
positive,19/4/20,this is an ideal bar for someone that wants the taste of a nutty candybar but with grams of protein tastes like a payday high fat and sugar content are the downsides though
positive,17/4/20,decided to try this out with no information on the product or past experience with the company because i m familiar with powdered soup mix in general and if this one specifically tasted weird i could probably do something myself to make it better the soup is good four stars because the garlic and onion flavors are a bit strong if you are on a low sodium diet you ll want to steer clear because the sodium content is pretty high to be expected with a product like this but you never can tell over all i don t regret my purchase and may even buy again in the future
positive,3/4/20,i love this stuff i brew several pitchers of iced tea from it every day and it has become my standard beverage now i ve had plenty of white teas from the various folks who mass produce them like lipton but this is the first time i ve bought it loose and brewed it up myself rather than pre brewed or in tea bag form so point is i m an amateur i don t have experience with other loose leaf white teas to compare but i find this stuff divine it s mild yet tasty and i don t ever get any caffeine effects that i notice now if you need something to wake up in the morning i could see that being a problem but as something i drink all day long i definitely don t want to have to worry about getting jittery or cutting myself off at a particular point in the evening i ve never had a hard time going to sleep after drinking this tea and that s great in my book there is some debate as to whether white tea has lower caffeine content than other teas like black teas but i can only go by personal experience and personally i find that black teas like english breakfast when i brew them up give me a very noticeable caffeine kick this does not in any way this tea seems great i wish i had the expertise to know whether i m enjoying something that really is awesome or some shoddy imposter that y know simply makes me very happy to drink but has no real quality to it i suspect this is pretty decent quality and i hope once the two pounds run out to try some other brand at least in a limited quantity to see how they stack up to one another oh and a side note turns out throwing out your first brief steep will not make the rest caffeine free read more here if you re interested also one of my favorite aspects of this white tea and i assume it s true of most white teas is that there is almost no bitterness black tea isn t exactly like tonic water but it does have a bit of a bitter taste and i found that i really enjoyed it once that bitterness was gone even though i didn t know or think that black tea was unpleasantly bitter i now notice it quite a bit a case of one of those you don t know what you could ve done without until it s gone sorts of things i guess happy brewing
positive,7/8/19,i love honey and i often buy expensive gourmet types i decided to try this one because rain forest sounded unusual and also because it is labeled organic this honey met my best expectations it has very nice texture and aroma to it for this price i couldn t believe it it does taste like a gourmet honey i disagree with one of the previous comments this honey s taste is not overbearing at all good quality honey should have a distinct flavor that s what sets apart honeys coming from different areas and flower types and that easily recognizable flavor is what is valued in each type of honey
positive,9/3/18,this is a good as it gets next to starbucks and since it is in your own home it is even better
positive,18/5/18,while the coffee is very tasty with lots of flavor i can t help being bothered by the high price everywhere on line or in store and the official site has it for box with capsules of which only is the coffee the rest is the milk well we need that too still
positive,27/1/19,i love all the dolce gusto milky coffees but this is my favorite pricewise and tastewise this beats the expensive coffee shops any day
positive,8/11/19,for a great appetizer stuff these little guys with goat cheese or goat cheese mixed with cream cheese and a little fresh basil just put the cheese and basil in a plastic baggie sqish to mix add mild if too thick cut a corner from the bag and squeeze into the drained peppadews they ll be the hit of the dinner party for style points serve in a long skinny olive dish
positive,25/10/21,these are fantastic better than regular pretzels i was expecting them to be hard and grainy like everything else gf but they were not they are made with potato and corn starch instead of rice flour seriously these are really good
positive,8/5/20,this cheddar cheese tastes great it s not truly a sharp tangy taste but it is cheddar the drawback is the shipping cost of nearly for lbs eventhough it arrives virtually over night the nutrional label is as follows for a size cube calories total fat g saturated fat grams trans fats cholesterol mg sodium total carbs less than g protein grams this cheese cannot be frozen as the label states it can be stored in the fridge up to one month but we consumed this in a week for a special party i included the nutritional content due to the marketplace did not state the facts when i bought this hopefully this helps other consumers
positive,28/9/18,i love this stuff it s like the sencha shot but with a bit softer flavor profile still fills in like an energy drink but without the weirdly contrived and overly sweet flavors of those drinks this stuff is also actually good for you
positive,29/7/19,product tastes really good just like regular pasta if you ask me however it does take twice as long to cook which is fine by me if it has lower carbs
positive,9/3/18,realllllly good i saw this reviewed on seattle coffee gear s site and being me i thought oo i wonder if its on amazon sure enough they had the whole bean version which i wanted more but but no grinder yet so i bought drip and since i hadn t tried it before i was wondering if it was really good or if it was just meh this is awesome coffee the drip grind is really great too and strong i learned quick that you do not want to use too much now if your big on strong coffee go nuts i used a cone type filter and used tablespoons and i didn t really level off much and it was sooo strong but not bitter it was super smooth and it was chocolaty really good love this coffee plan on buying more if you can t find it on here just go to their website
positive,18/5/18,this is a very tasty powdered instant decaf chai tea mix it blends easily and well and tastes delicious i like to take a few packets when i travel
positive,17/5/20,as other reviewers have noted already this seems to be kellogg s attempt to replicate honey nut cheerios at least in appearance nutritionally the two are also very similar crunchy nut tastes sweeter and i found myself eating it as a snack i can t say the taste is too similar to hnc so just because you like one doesn t mean you ll necessarily like the other overall it s definitely to my liking and i can see myself buying both crunchy nut and hnc
positive,26/3/20,we cannot believe how flavorful this kraft thick and spicy brown sugar barbecue sauce tastes i used this to cook some very meaty chicken breast and the flavors popped it s not too spicy for us and i assume it s because of the brown sugar you can t go wrong with buying a product from kraft foods
positive,24/2/20,i started drinking this tea about weeks ago and have seen my acne slowly fade away my co workers even mentioned how bright my complexion was looking
positive,3/5/19,all the cures work and taste great i like hickory smoked flavored items so this was great for me great seasoning
positive,27/3/20,absolutely the best nutella alternative i actually prefer it over nutella it tastes so rich and just plain phenomenal a bit more hazelnutty than nutella gah just great
positive,31/12/20,great size to try out xylitol before making a larger commitment i like that it is birch and not corn and made in usa you should be aware that xylitol has a spearmint type sweetness to it it may alter the taste of some foods because of this trait i use it in my coffee as a substitute for regular sugar and i am completely satisfied you need to add slightly more to get the same level of sweetness but its close
positive,13/1/20,these bars all of the roll types are hard to eat that s actually part of why i like them so much because they take some effort to bite into and chew they basically force you to eat slower as a result you feel more satisfied at the end of eating one than if you had scarfed down a candy bar in three bites i don t find them hard as rocks though just very chewy if you don t like chewy food then these are definitely not for you i also really like the texture contrast between the crunchy crispy outside and the chewy nougat inside of the bar there is a bit of a mess factor involved in eating these as noted by one reviewer the caramel is sticky and sometimes leaves traces on the wrapper and the outside crispy crunchy coating tends to crumble off a bit if you want to keep the inside of your car spotlessly clean you might not want to chow down on a go lean roll bar while driving nevertheless i still think these are some of the best bars out there they are not discernibly chalky nor do they have a strange chemical aftertaste the way that many protein or energy bars do they really are like fortified candy bars and they pack quite a high protein and fiber punch for only calories each while only having about mg of sugars about tablespoon per bar i was expecting more like mg when i tried my first one the chocolate turtle roll is my favorite flavor but honestly i ve tried every single flavor of the go lean roll bars and they are really all quite good
positive,21/9/20,i ve been receiving this product via auto delivery for about a year now i try to eat one of these bars as my lunch at least days a week it tastes like a candy bar and provides enough fiber protein etc to replace a meal i think it s a great way to help me lose weight
positive,2/12/20,my wife and i are senior citizens on a fixed income though not as fixed as it was six months ago if you are like us and looking for a reasonably priced and tasty source of protein in a well rounded package with other vital nutrients look no further this stuff is delicious don t be surprised when unsuspecting dinner guests ask for the recipe we just reply that it s a family secret the only con i can think of is having to choose between the beef the lamb and the turkey but why choose just buy all three
positive,20/11/19,this dressing is awesome it s very tasty and not so full of chemical ingredients as other dressings we wish we would have discovered it earlier

positive,20/11/19,as a big fan of arnold palmers half lemonade half iced tea over ice i m pleased with this k cup variety i add a bit of sugar after brewing it over a big cup filled with ice and its a great alternative to soda or trying to mix an arnold palmer myself at home

positive,1/3/21,i bought these in response to a just for you recommendation and was very pleased the product was fresh and gummy not stale at all i was surprised at how brightly colored these bears are i admire their tasty tasty glow just before i pop them into my mouth i was home when the box arrived and since it was a warm day i was glad i was the bears were crammed together at one end of the packaging and very warm so i popped the unopened bag into the fridge for a while when they had cooled i opened the bag it s not a resealable bag and divided the bears into ziplocs eating the ones that fell onto the counter for ummmm health and safety reasons hopefully this will keep them fresh a long while
positive,5/5/21,this is the only food i have been feeding my dog since i took him off puppy chow he loves it his coat is soft and shiny and i haven t had any health problems he is a year old mini dachshund so this small breed formula works well for him

positive,9/10/21,ultra light weight and real live fruit a great combination the fruit is freeze dried for those of you that remember space ice cream it is the same idea the fruit is sliced and placed in a machine that freezes the fruit and then a vacuum pulls off the water the process retains a lot of the original flavor and preserves the fruit for almost eternity well about two years expiration date on the pouches without using any chemicals the taste is really nice these are all crisp fruit pieces not the gummy fruit leather food banana strawberry is probably the tastiest and most fragile the strawberry flavor is strong and the bananas are subtle without picking up the strawberry flavor apples come in a nice second the pieces are thick and about two inches in diameter the pears are good maybe a touch tart and have the same texture as the apples the fruit is completely dry and absorbs water in your mouth very quickly if you eat it too fast the strawberries coat your teeth a little bit the others are very clean to eat i like these packages in my carryon bag for plane trips they make a great emergency snack take up little space and weigh nothing number two son packs these in his lunch almost every day now he likes the strawberry banana the best i really like all three flavors the pouches list that they are a product of china i list that as information so you can be aware of where this fruit comes from and make no value judgment for you the manufacturing process has been around for a very long time it is a very safe process and as long as the fruit going in is good the food should be good so far every pouch has been consistently good i like these a lot they make a great snack
positive,6/3/21,the dried fruit are very tasty the individual pkgs are handy and convenient great for people on the go i recommend this product
positive,12/2/21,whoa a really nice sweetness it is softer than the raw organic cane sugar i am presently using and it has no aftertaste i never could get used to stevia in my coffee but this is delicious just a very good product
positive,2/12/20,this is a staple item at our house i use it in soups barbecue meatloaf and anything else that we want to spice up pure tasting w o any other spices overpowering the flavor you apply as much heat as you desire and still maintain the integrity of your recipe the small jars were timely and intact when delivered
positive,20/11/19,i ve tried many pancake batters and this one is up there as one of the best great flavor the texture is a little fluffy and stretchy but maybe because i added an extra egg the batter needs a lower cooking temperature though otherwise it burns rather easily easy to work with though and best of all no sugar only granulated honey
positive,25/6/21,these are fantastic they are a good price for what you get i made sugar cookies and the kids drew on them
positive,17/3/20,the taste of gloria jean s butter toffee is so wonderful as soon as it begins to brew you can smell it throughout the kitchen the taste is deep rich and sweet

positive,25/1/21,i have been a marzipan fanatic for over years while there are finer and fancier marzipans in my opinion for the money this is a very nice dependable product i buy a pound wedge every year and make candy gifts for family and friends and always get compliments and cheers if you are a serious gourmet you might not care for it but for most people for general use it is quite nice

positive,30/9/20,i was following a diet where no sugar was allowed i tried this product and it has a good taste with out sugar i also used to put some other mint flavor herb tea mixed with this to get my own flavor worth trying
positive,6/7/21,i ordered this for my diabetic daughter i found some not so great reviews from people so i only ordered one bottle my whole family loves this stuff i even like it and i am not a sno cone fan it has an excellent flavor the syrup is light and does not overtake the ice i will order all of my syrups from back to basics sugar free collection from now on i highly reccoment this product
positive,29/6/21,i add this to my kids milk for added protein and calcium it clumps together so you have to mix it up in a blender but it tastes great and is worth the price to avoid hormones in non organic milk it is hard to find around here and i m glad amazon carries it they offer it cheaper than special ordering it from the health food store i add it to homemade icing and ice cream too

positive,21/10/21,i ve never had mallomars before i live in wisconsin and do not know if they make it all the way over here the only time i ever remember hearing the name before is in the simpsons episode hurricane neddy when nice guy flanders finally snaps and cusses out the whole town upon getting to the portly police chief wiggum he says the only case you ve gotten to the bottom of was a case of mallomars i assume by what i ve read that they are a fall only type product like the mcrib i am also informed by the box that they are a new york kind of thing regardless i m glad vine gave me the chance to try them because they are so good the crunchy dark chocolate coating over a marshmallow lump and thin crunchy cookie gives a s mores like experience that truly satisfies an excellent snack buy a box today
positive,25/10/21,i was told about this stuff at a party and as a lover of mayonnaise thought i d buy some i don t use it a lot but it s pretty good on fries i imagine it will make a great tunafish sandwich too if you ve never had it before it tastes a lot like traditional mayo but considerably more vinegar y some people who don t like mayo have told me they like this
positive,29/6/21,i discovered these at my local trader joe s but then they stopped carrying them i hunted and located them under their original colors they make a very tasty vegetable broth carrot and onion flavors are not too strong as in some other broths
positive,5/7/21,i enjoy bloodymary s but at times making a mix from scratch is too timely so i settle for something different i ve tried several other bloody mixes with poor results the zing zang bloody mix is the closest i ve come to homemade it s extremely tasty no more skipping an urge for a bloody when this mix is at hand highly recommend

positive,18/10/21,despite the poor review below this instant udon bowl is suprisingly delicious this instant udon bowl is so delicious most people can t tell the difference between udon served at a restaurant and the udon from this bowl i love adding an egg to my meal with this udon i just plop it in there with bowling water and boom fresh udon with egg can t be beat enjoy
positive,29/6/21,i used to be able to buy this in the grocery stores but no longer i don t know why since it s the best pepper out there for cooking and flavoring it s easy to use grind is just right and more flavorful than bland black pepper i use it in salads and whenever i am adding pepper to a recipe
positive,16/9/21,it s hard to rate and review a cheez it if you like the white cheddar or monterey jack kind then you ll like this one too these are just a little bit milder
positive,24/8/21,the new cheez it mozzarella flavored crackers are great tasting the crunch was transformed into a creamy cheese flavor as i greedily shoveled them into my mouth i had to shovel them because the crackers were broken into crumbs when i received them this however in no way detracted from the flavor or deterred me from the swift completion of my appointed task wait i think i missed one mmmmm
positive,24/6/21,i came home from a hot morning in the arizona sun and opened my illy issimo coffee drink nice and cold from the fridge i found the expresso taste strong but refreshing and the amount of sweetness just right great product
positive,27/9/21,very deep and tasty caffe drink it s got just a hint of sweetness and a hint of chocolate taste not too much fat and less sugar than most drinks of this type even my husband who doesn t like coffee likes it it reminds me of a starbucks double shot but less sweet and it has less cream i d definitely buy these and try them again
positive,29/6/21,switched to this melitta lite coffee from dunkin donuts coffee delicious flavorful smooth brew without leaving jangly coffee nerves or early morning digestive difficulties the low acid and reduced caffeine really help highly recommend
positive,29/6/21,my year old has been eating this soup since she was about year old she absolutely loves it and so do i it s organic and very healthy with lower sodium than just about any other canned soup on the market
positive,31/7/21,great way for kids to get in their fruits and veggies i add to yogurt smoothies
positive,11/9/21,my husband and i love to cook jarred sun dried tomatoes available in our area grocery stores have been a disappointment not these flavorful and easy to use in a variety of dishes the flavor is a burst of summer sweetness often these are eaten as chef s treats during cooking price is more than fair i will keep these on hand always
positive,12/8/21,this tea is very flavorful the pyramidal tea bags seem to allow more flavor to infuse i would buy this again
positive,31/7/20,i love this balsamic vinager it has a great flavor on par with some of the more expensive ones i have tried
positive,13/6/20,not to sweet not too bitter the blueberry is not overbearing but yet you know it s there overall i like it
positive,31/7/20,i like cashews any way so i m biased i really enjoyed these they do earn the name of salty though so this product is not for those that need to eat low sodium but for the rest of us they will be a tasty treat
positive,13/6/20,i was pleasantly surprised by this product i like salt and pepper flavors in general but this one has a bit garlic and onion flavor to it that i liked a lot the pepper isn t too hot but it gives it a nice kick the pepper flavor doesn t compare with freshly ground pepper naturally but it s pretty good for a commercially made product it s a tiny bit too salty for my taste but i know that tends to be personal preference that s different for everybody the nuts are well roasted and crunchy they re also a really nice size too often i see tiny nuts that don t have much flavor these nuts are tasty i would get these again these would be an interesting snack to serve to guests
positive,26/9/20,i ve been partial to emerald s products so my favorable reaction to this one comes as no surprise to me however i would warn that this may not be to everyone s taste at least at first the sea salt definitely has more kick than the usual salted nuts and the pepper gives it a decided bite for those whose taste in nuts tend more towards sweeter concoctions this may be a bit much but for those who like dark beer strong coffee and snacks with attitude this is a welcome treat
positive,17/10/20,first of all i m a cashew lover so i figured i d like these nuts what i didn t expect was how much i d like the sea salt pepper combo there s a slight twang after eating a handful of these and they are great with a cold beer or soda each nut is big and bold no little pieces in this jar the packaging is great good for taking along on trips the twist lid is easy on and off if you enjoy spice go for these the pepper does give a little extra kick
positive,14/12/20,i ordered this from another website and my newly diagnosed to need to be gluten free year old son loved it when returning to the other site to no longer find it there i returned to my old friend amazon com i am impressed with all the gf products that i can get on here and even more excited that i can use the subscribe and save option to have a continuous supply of mac n cheese always in our house thanks
positive,29/5/20,just tried my first cup and it s as good as the restaurant stuff i typically pay a premium for for oz with ice i m loving it update i tried the pantainorasingh brand which is not nearly as good as this brand sadly i may end up throwing away the other brand even though i hate to be wasteful the taste is very different
positive,9/12/20,this tea is very tasty it doesn t have the unappealing fresh paint smell that some other thai tea mixes have i m very pleased with it i agree with the other reviewer that the price is high for shipping in my area i could not find it in the asian stores so i have to order it for three bags the shipping was just more than the shipping for one bag so i bought three to offset the shipping cost i also agree with one of the other reviewers that the tea should be brewed very strongly then add water or milk to it later i love the tea hot or cold with or without cream the lovely orange color shows up better when you use cream or milk and the color is part of the charm of the drink
positive,4/8/20,i don t know if this product tastes exactly like the thai tea in the restaurants nor do i know if i m brewing the tea exactly the way they do but it tastes very good and i look forward to drinking it it s a personal treat it is best served with regular half and half not milk or fat free half and half i brew it using my coffee maker i put the filter paper just as if i were about to brew some coffee i use my judgement with the amount of tea to water ratio and i can now visualize the amount i need for a specific strength all in all it s a good product only had a problem with the shipping i live in nyc and will perhaps search for this product in china town next time but until then i have two bags to keep me busy
positive,13/6/20,i have a puppy that absolutely loves them she considers them her personal reward for everything she does a good training aid
positive,21/11/20,i am more concerned with sugar than fat and this is a great sugar free item best tasting creamer without sugar not too sweet just perfect
positive,25/5/21,i ve been searching for a good tasting protein drink since i had a gastric bypass years ago i saw this product on another weight loss surgery blog and decided to give it a try you can drink it warm unlike most other protein drinks or cold and it mixes quite easily if you use a container with a blender ball i thought it was a bit too thick when i mixed it according to the directions scoops in oz of water so the next time i used more water others might prefer the thicker version though i also added crushed ice after i mixed it which kept it cold longer and made it more like an iced coffee drink when i travel i take my empty blender ball container in my carryon bag stuffed with ziploc bags filled with protein shake powders but on my next trip will be taking these packets instead
positive,25/5/21,i was just introduced to these olives on a united flight this week probably the best tasting green olives i have ever had i usually never eat green olives i was so happy with them i purchased two snack pack boxes with the olove packs on my return flight to share with my wife and kids i m thrilled i am able to purchase these on amazon and really suggest them to anyone looking for a great snack
positive,20/1/21,i used this in cakes cup cakes and candies its great in drinks i found as well as long as your making mixed drinks i really enjoyed this produce and i urge people to try this and experiment with it be adventurous with your cooking and the flavors you use its truly worth it
positive,8/2/21,my dog loves them loves them loves them i find them a bit pungent they are fish after all but my opinion isn t the one that counts
positive,10/2/21,we picked some of these up this week they re very convenient and quite handy to have around just to grab when you re walking out the door the taste is about what you d expect from hershey s chocolate milk it s chocolate it s sweet and it s really good it s nice that they don t need to be refrigerated either at least until after they are opened on the one hand these are better for a child than cola but on the other hand there s still a lot of sugar in them and calories in only oz i m looking at the servings right now and for one container it has g of sugar i ll grant you it s not empty calories because there s of the daily intake of calcium but still if you can train the kid to drink skim milk that s fewer calories for them when i was a kid my parents used to give me skim milk with not much chocolate powder in it my real treat was the chocolate milk at school but it was fairly rare to get it they d have chocolate milk maybe once a week these things probably aren t all that bad by comparison to some of the junk food kids eat i just feel a little wary if feeding them lunch for lunch because the calories do add up i d never tell anybody how to raise their kids or what to drink themselves but i for one plan to have these as a treat every now and then instead of as a regular part of my diet anyway they are tasty and i d recommend
positive,9/10/20,my wife doesn t like chocolate but she likes granola i love chocolate and i m fine with granola here s a granola snack we can agree on she tasted it and pronounced it pretty good i m a big fan of chocolate bars with add ins like bacon or fruit or chili so chocolate with berries is right up my alley i like it and i don t have to feel guilty when i eat it now if i can just get our year old to try some i can share the whole family s opinion
positive,31/7/20,i m always looking for healthy snack alternatives but healthy snacks are not always very tasty this one was it has a good crunch factor and the chocolate and berry flavors stood out without being overpowering my two teen aged sons fought over the bag one enjoyed is as a cereal the other just as a snack i myself enjoyed it sprinkled over some fat free frozen yogurt the serving size cup is a little small it would be easy to eat the whole bag without even realizing it but it s perfect as a topping for yogurt or ice cream my boys have asked me to add this to my regular shopping list
positive,13/6/20,i bought this product as a gift for my son who is away at college he liked the tea and enjoyed having a varity to pick from i will re order this again two thumbs up
positive,5/12/20,this mix is exactly as advertised i decided to add chopped onion sesame seeds and a small amount of chile paste and the results were outstanding i also used lbs of ahi instead of the full lb and it worked fine i would buy this product again
positive,1/11/20,without my miracle noodles i would go crazy my cravings pasta are under control with miracle noodles they are delicious with any sauce or olive oil
positive,6/6/21,this is a chocolate donut flavored coffee it is not pre sweetened has a great aroma and flavor it is perfect for someone who likes it dark or likes to add cream and or sugar on his or her own i have tried other flavors like this and this one is by far the best
positive,21/7/20,we love k cups and the ease of using them the donut house collection chocolate glazed donut is great tasting i would highly recommend these k cups
positive,5/1/21,this coffee is excellent it s a lighter blend so those who prefer chewable coffee may not like it it has an amazing scent of a chocolate donut i m new to the k cup but so far this is one of my favorite flavors
positive,23/1/21,i got a really good deal of this item in amazon amazon provides must cheaper price than local stores the noodle includes two separate soup powders that make the taste so amazing
positive,31/7/20,fairly easy to cook a little nutty in taste for some
positive,13/6/20,these flakes are smaller than i expected for something called large but they taste great straight out of the package throw them in your hot or cold cereal on top of ice cream or mix them into yogurt they re a sweet crunchy healthy treat
positive,1/12/20,this was good honey in a nice package i used it as a compliment for the beer i made called honey britches i taped the sticks to the side of the bottles and it added a nice little sweetness to the beer that already used orange honey in the brew process honey ferments completely so there was very little residual sugar left which this item helped remedy
positive,30/1/21,this is my favorite snack bar the price is about the same as the sale prices i find at the supermarket on a per unit basis
positive,1/1/21,at cents a piece these are a good deal they contain all natural ingredients which sounds like something for a tree hugger which i m not it actually makes them good and not disgusting like some other granola type bars i m torn between the apple pie ones and these which are both the same price one of each makes a good cheap lunch
positive,11/1/21,the cinnamon roll flavors are not quite as good as the other larabars there is just not enough cinnamon for my tastes however they are still very tasty
positive,31/7/20,several people have written in to say that their larabars were old and crumbly i just received a box of chocolate coconut chew larabars and they are in date moist have a good consistency and are delicious this is a perfect mid morning or after workout snack i love that they are raw vegan kosher contain all natural ingredients and have no processed sugar these taste better are healthier and have a better texture than most lines of exercise oriented energy bars
positive,13/6/20,best energy bar ever healthy tasty less than ingredients what could be better than that great taste too
positive,14/1/21,i am a marathon runner and diabetic i have spent years tinkering with different energy meal bars and eventually settled with clifbar which is not bad though it has many sugary ingredients like rice syrup etc i was extremely excited to discover larabar it is delicious contains no added sugars and provides an excellent source of energy for training definitely the best bar on the market
positive,7/12/20,this bar is good it tastes like eating a banana mixed in with some nuts i like that it doesn t have any sugar added and it just uses the natural sugars from the banana to flavor the bar
positive,5/5/21,i was so hoping that starbucks would come out with a mild blend for k cups starbucks has exceeded my hopes this coffee is delicious thanks starbucks
positive,23/11/20,great to have a sugar that tastes great cooks with everything and has not yet been cooped by the gmo crowd of producers we ll order again and enjoyed the speedy delivery we wish this came in larger bags for truly bulk orders lbs bags would be great
positive,29/8/20,not my favorite but for the price great product and it s handy stores well and works well in coffee and other foods i have added distilled water and used in my cereal straight is fine but i am calorie conscious so i prefer to add a little water organic valley is the best but for obvious reasons it cost more
positive,18/1/21,my year old really likes them they are worth the price good packing and fresh to taste i highly recommend this product
positive,18/6/21,i have never used gluten free pasta before i absolutely love this pasta i enjoy eating spaghetti once in a while and this satisfies that craving it is very important to make sure the water is boiling prior to putting in the pasta i say this because my daughter decided to make spaghetti for herself and added pasta in pan of water before it was boiling well what happened was a glob of gooey mess lesson learned
positive,18/6/21,i made this purchase for a visiting relative and although i did not drink it she enjoyed the tea very much and ordered her own when she returned home
positive,7/7/21,i received this product as part of the amazon vine program this lipton to go decard tea is good and is refreshing i wished it had less ingredients but overall is a better alternative to soda pop and less calories
positive,18/6/21,i really liked the taste of this i mixed it with water bottles cold from the refrigerator i found it took quite a bit of shaking to mix the powder in and never did get it completely dissolved as there were still tiny bits that settled to the bottom i think if you drink some from the bottle before adding the drink mix it would allow more room for mixing in the bottle the strawberry taste was excellent not too sweet and no strange aftertaste i really like that it is low calorie without artificial sweetner it makes drinking my daily intake of water easier the packets are small enough to tuck in a pocket for use on the go the package has a notch to make opening easier i will definitely buy these i would have given five starsnif it was easier to dissolve
positive,7/7/21,this product has great taste and not too sweet the tea mixes up in your water like coolaide and comes in individual packets so you can take it along with you however the packets do not tear by hand but you must use a knife or scissors to get them open that is the only thing that needs to be improved
positive,1/7/21,this tastes like a tropical cocktail all it needs is the alcohol didn t try adding that the mango flavor is pungent and if you like that flavor you will like this tea very enjoyable taste
positive,7/7/21,when i try a powdered drink mix i am interested in three factors first i want the stuff to taste good second i want it to dissolve well third i d rather drink something without a lot of calories this drink satisfied all three conditions for me so i would be interested in buying more in the future the drink tastes good it s a little sweet for one packet mixed into a drinking glass but there are enough fruit flavors to make the sweetness a bit complex and worth tasting i didn t taste the pineapple at all but the mango flavor was nice and pronounced not quite overwhelmed by the honey taste it doesn t taste like home brewed iced tea but it was closer than i expected from a powdered mix the box warns that the powder needs some extra mixing to fully dissolve but i had no problem at all stirring it in a glass for a couple of seconds there was no grainy layer at the bottom of the glass and my drink was smooth finally each packet is only ten calories so this still counts as a viable low calorie alternative to soft drinks there are lower calorie sweeteners out there but ten is close enough to zero that this mix is a viable beverage for those who prefer to drink water most of the time this is not a must drink experience but it s very good by powdered drink mix standards and i recommend it
positive,23/7/21,this has lots of flavor and is great that it is decaf i don t like drinking caffeine throughout the day i would recommend this as it s easy to carry with you in your purse briefcase or tote bag and it adds a lot of flavor to your water it only adds calories though great stuff
positive,20/7/21,normally i just don t like powdered drink mixes but these are really good the package says that half a packet is for ounces of water and has two servings per packet i used them in oz of water the first time however it was sweet enough that i cut back to a little more than half a packet for oz and it still had a nice sweetness it s a great product and i would purchase it without any reservation
positive,19/7/21,i often buy products like this to use when traveling because it is cheaper to buy a case of water and use a drink mix than to buy sodas and drinks on the road this tasted like fresh brewed tea and disolved completely i wasn t stuck with a residue on the bottom just the right sweetness level and a tasty mix of strawberry flavor
positive,18/6/21,i was surprised at how good this tasted it s sweet and you can really taste the pineapple it also has only calories per oz serving better than soda and it mixes well in water the tea also doesn t have that strong instant tea after taste i would definately buy this again
positive,7/7/21,this has a great flavor if you are concerned about what you give your kids and don t like all the extras that are put into kids foods you ll love this i have been looking for these for a while my kids love the flavor of these in their lunchbox and i do too they taste fine with no extra junk in them
positive,27/6/21,the packaging makes this great on the go the applesauce is tasty i think it s green apples so it has a little green apple taste but not sour kids like it and like the squeezy action involved the amount is great for a quick snack it would be easy to use while walking runny biking as an alternative to the energy shot gel things that some people like to use
positive,21/7/21,taste is much better than competing brands and has a good shelf life subscribe and save let us you be sure to always have the right amount on hand at the best price
positive,18/6/21,we have been getting these crisps for some time now and we love them i also ordered some for my granddaughter they make a great healthy treat for her and she loves them too
positive,7/7/21,it tastes great dissolves just fine and provides the jolt i need to start my day
positive,30/6/21,when i was a kid post used to make a cereal called c w post it was a granola type cereal that was the absolute best it disappeared from the grocery shelves sometime in the s fast forward to today walking down the grocery isle i noticed the single row of just bunches high on the grocer s shelf over the years i had tried to find a granola cereal that could live up to the legend of the c w from my childhood sampling all that i could find i had no luck equaling that wonderful crunchy taste likely this new find just bunches would also disappoint but i figured i should give it a try to see if it came at least close to what i remembered it was from the post people perhaps they reached deep into their cereal recipe box and revived an old flavor from the past one could only hope it the parking lot of the grocery i cracked open the box to give it a taste instantly i was transported back to my childhood munching on cereal and watching saturday morning cartoons the road runner bugs bunny it all came back i had found the holy grail of cereals ok maybe that s taking it too far but man its really good so good i subscribed for auto ship every month
positive,1/7/21,so far these have become my favorite granola bar from nature valley or anywhere else i just discovered them a few months ago and since my supply was getting low i went to wally world today and bought them out except for one box that was way in the back and beyond my reach sometimes i ll have one in the morning and don t feel hungry for hours they are very crunchy and take awhile to chew since i don t want to do any damage to my teeth and also have high fructose corn syrup wish it was honey instead but i like them
positive,24/8/21,very tasty it s hard to find something which has as much protein g as sugars g i just wish that the sugars were really sugar instead of corn syrup also it would taste even better in my opinion if it had as much sugar but still the best snack bar out there
positive,25/6/21,i had a recipe for a pear pomegranate pie which required this ingredient i also used it in a blood orange pomegranate fennel shallot beet feta cheese and toasted almond salad i served both of these with a crown roast of pork with cumberland sauce for christmas dinner this molasses is sour and sweet simultaneously and imparts an interesting taste but could if used too lavishly overhwhelm a dish
positive,13/9/21,this is my favourite tea at work i sometimes cannot get to it right away and it doesn t matter how long it sits it doesn t get that bitter bitter like your drinking a dandelion taste it s refreshing and i can t start my day without it
positive,18/6/21,i don t eat right at all i am very picky and i use these to supplement my diet great source of vitamins for on the go i actually drink one for breakfast and one before bed i buy at sams in bulk
positive,7/7/21,the taste of the onions in this first jar is not up to the standards i ve come to expect with my many jars that i have purchased through the years
positive,15/7/21,having usually eating store baught peanuts i d have to say the taste was much to my supprise very fresh and tasty their about times bigger than regular peanuts i m glad i got them with the skins they were very tasty the salt just right
positive,11/7/21,i can t get this panda express in stores or restaurant locations anymore it is fantastic stir fry sauce i ordered it on amazon price was good and shipping was fast will be ordering again
positive,7/10/21,these cheese balls are hard to find and these are so good they melt in your mouth and are very cheesy if you love cheese this is a must buy
positive,6/7/21,everyone that tastes these chips love them they all ask where they can get them thank you for the email on when they were back in stock i will be ordering more my grandkids children raid the cupboards for them when they come by
positive,18/6/21,i have bought a few of these along the years just from local stores and the flavor has been hit or miss but these are great hold flavor and gives the right amount of heat to your food i will buy this product again once i run out be sure to keep in fridge or freezer to keep oils fresh
positive,7/7/21,i ate some raw and roasted most of them at low temp and put in the frig nuts can go rancid so have a plan to preserve and store in frig or freezer when buying this amount of nuts good buy tasted fresh
positive,27/7/21,mi del old fashion swedish style lemon snaps are a crispy chewy lemony delight if you are always in search of healthy snacks that aren t short on flavor these are the cookies for you these lemon snaps are made with organic unbleached wheat flour canola oil and natural lemon flavor there s no artificial lolly pop lemon taste here you can just imagine squeezing the lemon into the mix yourself five cookies have calories so it s not too much for a little something to get you through your day or after dinner as a light dessert without the guilt highly recommended yum
positive,13/7/21,i had a variety of granola and this one ranks of my top most favorites it is a very crunch granola with a coconut main taste it is sweet but not overly so i eat at as a snack when i am craving something fills you up very fast and satisfies any sugar cravings
positive,13/9/21,this chipotle sauce is very tasty and it can be used with many different things however i loved it the most with vegetarian meat i m a vegetarian living healthy and all grins and this sauce is amazing in a veggie sandwich or with cooked vegetarian meat however this sauce is very fattening hence why i took one star out it contains grams of fat in tbsp so one needs to be careful to have it in very small portions or make sure to have a good workout session after indulging in a good hearty meal containing this sauce overall i love this chipotle sauce very tasty
positive,7/9/21,i ve tried using this on chicken and hamburgers and really liked it it s a nice change from ketchup and bbq sauces the chipotle has a spicy tang but it s overwhelming it s probably even milder than the spicy sauces in an actual taco bell restaurant it actually has a slightly sweet taste it is a bit salty and creamy for those who are health conscious but i find that even a small bit provides a lot of flavor and can be spread quite far over your meal the bottle seems a bit smaller than you might expect but other than that i d recommend this
positive,17/4/21,mexican spices are so good on many foods this chipolte sauce has a great flavor unlike other hot sauces not very hot quite mild but intense i have put it on everything not just tacos
positive,10/3/21,i was pleasantly surprised by the taste of the chipotle sauce it is kind of like a spicy mayonnaise i used this sauce in tuna salad on sandwiches and as a salad dressing similar to mayo almost all of the calories come from fat i think it is tastier than mayo and has a nice amount of spice you can taste the pepper in the sauce but it doesn t leave your mouth burning it s a good balance of flavors
positive,17/4/21,i can t say i would ve purchased this in the store but having received it to taste and test out at home was certainly worthwhile surprisingly flavorful with a slight kick at the end this sauce makes a great accompaniment to chicken sandwiches salads even chili yum yum
positive,21/1/21,this sauce tastes pretty good it s creamy spicy but not overly so and has a nice flavor that pairs well with burritos and other mexican style foods that said i think it s a little bit overpriced for what it is the bottle is quite small fluid ounces is the two thirds the size of a soda can so the amount of sauce you get really isn t very much at all they make the bottle wide and skinny so that it has the appearance of capacity the concave curves on the side further deceive the eye so in summary what we have here is a tasty sauce offered for a high price i would recommend perhaps looking for a single bottle at your local supermarket before committing to an entire six pack to see if the flavor is worth the cost for you
positive,30/1/21,this is a great tasting product it can be used on more than just mexican food tried it on hot dogs and it was great not too spicy give it a try
positive,13/2/21,this taco bell chipotle sauce is quite enjoyable and has the tangy yet not very spicy taste you would expect i have used it on burritos and as a dip there is no question that if you like the flavor of chipotle sauce you will enjoy this but it is high in calories which i expected and did not mind for you do not need a lot too enjoy the flavor yet two tablespoons of this sauce contains calories from fat and a total of calories per serving size the serving size is the aforementioned two tablespoons it taste great just be aware of its high fat content and calories when serving size is measured by the spoon full you know the calories are high and even so i would get this product again
positive,15/1/21,taco bell s bold creamy chipotle sauce is perfectly described in its name this is a thick sauce with a strong smoky flavor and although it is quite spicy there is little heat i first used it to spice up black beans being served as a side dish for tacos the beans are so bland they always need something and this sauce was the perfect addition the sauce also worked beautifully with falafels again just the right amount of spice and it gave the pita bread sandwich stuffed with lettuce tomato cucumber and falafel balls a needed jolt finally i used the sauce on a veggie burger and it also worked beautifully there too i was pleased with the results each time i used it and found the sauce very versatile the only negative is it not low on calories two tablespoons have calories and of those are fat calories so i use it sparingly that said it is sufficiently spiced so that a little goes a long way
positive,6/3/21,this is a wonderful product and i am not one who dines at taco bell i used to eat there when i was younger in college but have not in years so i was pleased to try this product and find that it was great first i like that the bottle is not so huge because the taste will stay fresh instead of getting stale from lack of use i have many dressings and toppings etc in my fridge so it s nice to have a smaller bottle second the taste is excellent i love the creamy texture and it has just a little heat from the chipolte flavoring to be interesting but not too hot i used this on a home made taco salad but i also used it as a sauce on a noodle dish i made that was like a south of the border spaghetti grandchildren like noodles so we made noodles and taco flavored meat and this sauce with a few veggies thrown in and had a mexican style noodle dinner that they loved so i highly recommend this product
positive,8/6/21,this is a great sauce to use on sandwiches to give them a little extra kick love it with grilled chicken lettuce and tomato i would thin it a bit to use on a salad but it s just right with a sandwich could get creative with it meatloaf maybe
positive,17/4/21,these noodles take just a couple of minutes to make and there is only one flavoring pack indomie noodles are absolutely fantastic and cheaper but take a little more effort to make i buy both brands and use as the mood strikes me the reason i m writing a review however is more about the price every asian store i ve been to that sells this noodle pack charges around so it s definitely worth buying these at an asian store though not all asian stores sell sapporo i m hoping amazon will start selling the boxes of these for less than the asian stores sell single packets hint hint amazon just a note too indomie noodles are about half the price of these at least at the asian markets
positive,10/3/21,easy to use because of the pre measured packets the smell and flavor are just like at the theater very good popcorn on the negative side there are two comments i only put half of the seasoning because it is way too salty too many unpopped kernels otherwise makes watching movies at home a lot of fun
positive,14/1/21,everyone in our family liked these chips great taste and healthy compared to other chips if you like spicy food you will enjoy these
positive,14/10/21,this brand has always amazed people with their coffee flavors and the vermont country blend is just one of them my husband and i tried it for the st time and we loved it
positive,7/2/21,i love this raw cacao this is a really good value this is so much more expensive in whole foods i make a banana ice cream pudding with it that tastes amazing frozen bananas pureed with teaspoons of raw cacao and a pinch of salt i place it in the freezer for a bit to set simple healthy and toddler approved
positive,29/3/21,mat eacute is an awesome drink and rosamonte makes an affordable and good tasting product i would recommend this product to my friends and family
positive,17/4/21,never just made the orange by its self miked it with the cream soda made by the same company people were begging me for the recipy i never follow the instructions i have tasted this brand of soda prepared very poorly not by me though tip pound of sugar per gallon no more no less that is the master rule
positive,10/3/21,i actually liked the taste of this drink i would drink it without the energy factor the taste alone is the reason i give this product four stars there are two servings in one can i only drank one serving at a time i could not detect any extra energy or alertness i am a coffee drinker though it does have caffeine in it but not an excessive amount probably just the right amount so it doesn t give one the jitters i liked it
positive,10/7/21,this tastes great i can t say too much about the energy factor although i should point out that energy drinks don t usually do much for me it has a very nice mango flavor and doesn t taste like weird chemicals try it
positive,27/1/21,this product has a very good taste not like many of the other energy drinks it tastes like berries and is smooth not tart at least to me i had four ounce glasses during the day i didn t notice a huge spike in energy but i didn t need an afternoon nap either it didn t make me jittery etc and i slept well at night i wish it came in a diet drink no calories i would recommend this for the taste
positive,1/6/21,i enjoyed the taste of no fear but i can t say that it gave me any more energy than the other energy drinks on the market today since i do occasionally indulge in a few energy drinks from time to time i can say it delivered as much energy as other supplement brands the four stars were mainly for the taste
positive,20/8/21,this brand of energy drink tastes good and really gives you a jolt of energy i didn t have jitters afterwards and i noticed a difference in focus i have problems with some of them making me jittery but this one really worked with no side effects
positive,14/8/21,we really enjoy de boles angel hair pasta it isn t heavy and it is very tasty my kids are picky and this is the best product we have found to appease their request for quick and easy pasta
positive,21/4/21,this is the best angel hair pasta as far as i am concerned the taste and texture are great
positive,1/4/21,this couscous is absolutely wonderful the couscous is large pearl and is delicious served hot or cold cooks beautifully delicious plain with mushrooms mint or any one of a dozen other additions highly recommend it
positive,17/4/21,i usually order this product from the actual gevalia site because this flavor is quite yummy i also order the cafe sperl which is also known as viennese coffee when you first open the bag the nose is tickled with the pungent smell of chocolate and a lighter aroma of raspberry the coffee tastes unique because of the raspberry flavoring but it s enjoyable either freshly brewed or chilled
positive,10/3/21,i love this dressing it has such a good fruity flavor i ve already recommended it to friends
positive,22/4/21,i bought this for my hubby he loves dark rich coffee dark magic offers it great convenience of the kcup makes it that much nicer
positive,25/4/21,i love ordering on line esp from amazon just as i am about to run out of coffee i get a email re special deals and i simply order and in a day the products are shipped this coffee is fantastic try it also donut shop is great
positive,1/4/21,i m grateful for my keurig coffee maker the taste of green mountain brand dark magic is terrific got used up real fast
positive,30/6/21,first the nutrition facts serving size cup servings per container about calories fat g sodium mg carbohydrates g dietary fiber g sugars g other carbs g protein g this granola is really very tasty the chocolate chunks add a nice flavor and texture and the granola is very crunchy it comes in a plastic zip seal bag with so much chocolate and sugars this is by no means a health food but it s a great snack that at least has some nutrients unlike candy bars for instance and it tastes just as good if not better disclosure although i was not paid for this review i received one pouch of this product for free
positive,1/3/21,i confess i do not eat this granola from a bowl with milk i keep it stored in an airtight container and use a shot glass to scoop out an ounce at a time for snacking very easy to toss back using the shot glass and my fingers stay clean it is very good and has no bad ingredients
positive,29/1/21,this product is an alternative to eating granola bars the only downside is that portion control is easy with a granola bar whereas once you start eating this product out of the bag it is difficult not only to stop but also to gauge how much you have eaten unless you first scoop out what you want put it onto a plate and weigh it on a food scale which i doubt most people will do this is very tasty and is about the same calories as a granola bar for a similar portion while some of the pieces are chunks other pieces are single granola flakes or chips though this did not really bother me much as i like this since it is not superior in taste to the chocolate chip granola bars that i eat and since it is just too easy to eat a large portion for now i will stick with my granola bars but if portion control is not a concern then this is a great snack
positive,17/4/21,i am by no means a granola connoisseur but this stuff is pretty darn tasty this product is made with all natural ingredients there honestly isn t a lot of chocolate in it just the right amount it s dark chocolate but isn t too bitter or too sweet overall it s just a very nice blend and tastes delicious maybe a little pricey but not a dealbreaker when considering it s made with real ingredients i d say for taste for value recommended
positive,10/3/21,this granola is a mix of rolled oats and semi sweet chocolate chunks i couldn t find a description on the bag as to whether it s a snack or a cereal as a snack it s a bit dry for my taste and isn t as sweet as the delicious quaker natural but i quite enjoyed it with milk its crunchy texture is just right and the chocolate is a treat if you like granola this is a good one a good source of fiber
positive,30/5/21,i m typically a tea drinker after the first pot i made coffee every day until it was gone would definitely recommend
positive,28/9/21,i m a cherry nut all the soda i drink has some sort of cherry flavour so i wanted to try this too great taste and how can i go wrong with vitamin c thrown in for good measure will be most popular with those that already drink heathy sodas such as airforce nutrisoda flex black cherry and apple ounce cans pack of
positive,6/5/21,i tried another of these switch products and was less than pleased but maybe it was the flavor which i think was supposed to be watermelon the black cherry went down a lot easier although it s still a tad too acidic for me but it tastes good you know like black cherry brian w fairbanks
positive,20/4/21,i tried samu on a whim thinking that it would taste like many of the other coconut water drinks out there perhaps healthy but not terribly tasty to my surprise samu is fantastic it tastes fresh has the right amount of sugar and brings a subtle pleasantness along with it the design is pretty cool and my purchase supported an independent label i highly recommend this product and am sure that i will continue to purchase it
positive,20/4/21,this is a great quality olive oil with a slightly grassy overtone to the flavor it s obviously a bit more expensive than your average everyday supermarket olive oil but it is well worth the money
positive,21/4/21,these are really good tasting lentils the first thing i notice was the lack of that shinny coating you see on store bought lentils when you open the big you can tell right away there is something different about these they cook easily and hold their shape and taste great
positive,2/5/21,excellent snack that s healthy and nutricious my son loves it it is a tad pricier than other brands but it tastes better
positive,25/5/21,this french roast is by far my favorite i like a strong tasting coffee i also like the new packaging but i am glad that i didn t buy a keurig k cup holder the way this coffee is packaged you will have to put it in a covered container this type of k cup recycles better too
positive,7/9/21,this product exceeded expectation makes you feel better after drinking will buy again thank you dr oz for talking about it on your show
positive,25/5/21,coffee preference is just a matter of taste so my opinion regarding taste probably doesn t mean much you d have to try this coffee for yourself what i can tell you is that these soft bottom cups are certainly different from the usual all plastic k cups i was initially concerned about how well they would work in my keurig but after making about fifty or more brews they work perfectly no loose grinds left behind in the pod well my mug or anywhere else they cost a little less than k cups so that s a nice plus for me the minor drawback is that they come to you in plastic bags that once opened allow exposure of the pods to air simple fix i just put the remaining pods in a ziplock bag i like the taste of this french roast coffee and the fact that it s also cheaper than the competition hopefully when the patent on k cups expires this september we ll see more vendors offering better prices this is probably why keurig recently came out with a new brewer the vue that uses different and patented cups
positive,22/5/21,i received my package today fog chaser and was the first cup really good full body and full taste just like it came ground fresh and no i don t know or work for the company just thought you would like an honest review from someone that buys boxes of k cup coffee a month i noticed no sediment in my cup and yes they cut the corner by leaving off the pastic cup to avoid the copyright that says they would then owe kuerig a percentage which drives up the price of all coffe in k cups it s not a k cup but will fit a k cup maker and that is what they advertise i can live with putting the filter cups in a baggie i don t need to show off my coffee in a carousel so this is just great to get a subscription discount for this good of a coffee that will fit my k cup brewer
positive,19/7/21,was buying the kona blend until it dried up and then the price went through the roof tried several different k cup coffees until i found the fog chaser now i have it on my subscribe and save list i have it sent to my office my home my son s home every month it ain t kona but it is almost as bold the aroma fills the kitchen in the morning and that first sip is great every time and at the price of the kona it is the best bang for the buck i ll never go back
positive,7/9/21,as many other reviews have mentioned these are not the normal k cups but they work much the same i generally drink the stronger k cups emeril s jet fuel kona etc and i find that these fog chaser pods compare very favorably there is no bitter aftertaste just smooth flavor i have not had any sediment at the bottom of my cup i ve had sediment from other k cups i think people are a bit thrown by the smell of the coffee bag when they get it as it is a much stronger smell than you ll get from a box of k cups it does smell like when you open a fresh bag can of ground coffee which is sort of refreshing after using k cups for years we ve just finished the first bag of days which we kept in a ziplock bag and the last cup tasted as good as the first i already placed a subscribe and save order for the french roast to try out i will be keeping my subscription for the fog chaser as it is quite good
positive,25/8/21,this product makes a great cup of cofee bold but not bitter no bad after taste the smell starts the experience and the satisfied full flavor follows i will buy this product as long as it is available
positive,6/9/21,mm pink edible pearls are a wonderful addition to cakes cookies they can instantly add sophistication to any piece
positive,25/5/21,i just have to say that i agree with the first reviewer i really had a good experience with this product i was buying it for a friend it came very quickly the product is unique and it is something that everyone can use the customer service was outstanding
positive,7/9/21,great tasting kids love them and i don t have to worry that there are any genetically engineered ingredients a little pricey if you don t care if they are organic
positive,13/10/21,out of all their different kinds of cookies this is the one that rocks you would never know this was gluten free
positive,2/10/21,i got this as a small gift for my girlfriend who was always forgetting to buy more cheap popcorn at the store i thought she would enjoy some unique and gourmet popcorn and i was right she really liked them especially the purple kind we cook it on the stove with oil and it worked perfectly however don t be an idiot like me and splash oil all over your face does not feel good popcorn has a great distinct flavor and i think we will be returning for more
positive,23/9/21,this product is pretty delicious i love using stevia instead of other fake sugars because it s a natural product and seems less likely to because cancer i wish more things would use it instead
positive,26/6/21,if you love the flavor of toasted pecans this coffee is for you great flavor good coffee taste it was very easy to brew the right strength what a pleasure to wake up to the smell of toasted pecans and freshly brewed coffee this is the second time i ve purchased this coffee and i ll definitely do it again
positive,25/5/21,i received a small box of these ginger and honey crystals and i fell in love with them what a great way to bump up your cup of hot tea they are strong and i would recommend starting with a small portion i ordered two bags of thirty packs and now my daughter in law wants a pack love it
positive,7/9/21,we can get these crackers locally but the price is a lot higher i absolutely love these crackers and they have a deep rich cheese flavor i will continue to purchase these crackers from amazon to complement any holiday
positive,15/7/21,i m thrilled with this extract i ordered it on a tuesday night and had it by friday afternoon it came wrapped nicely in plenty of bubble wrap and tissue paper and was accompanied by a nice little note from the seller thanking me for my order it smells wonderful it smells just like cocoa powder and i use it in all my baked goods and even savory foods added to gravy it gives it that little something extra and it s phenomenal in whipped cream cookies brownies sweetbreads cakes even coffee and hot chocolate it s not a sweet extract so it gives some depth to foods without adding additiona sugar i will definitely be ordering this in the future and definitely ordering from this merchant again i am very impressed with the quality and the customer service provided
positive,3/6/21,very flavorful and gives amazing taste to salads and food in general just a pinch make a huge difference in the way your food tastes like this is the only type of salt i am using since i discovered it i put it on meat fish veggies salads soups etc everything tastes better with this salt i wish they would offer it in bigger sizes i usually order at a time so they last for a while since the size is small you will not be sorry for ordering this salt
positive,27/9/21,we love these little figs they are a great snack and a pop in your mouth size will definately buy them again
positive,19/6/21,i got this for my kids easter basket just to have something different and they loved it it tastes great and even travels well this is a great treat to take in the car or stick in a purse for that time when you are craving ice cream but can t have it
positive,25/5/21,true the flavor doesn t last for a long time but it tastes great and lasts long enough
positive,3/8/21,i use this treat as a reward for getting on the grooming table my three dogs line up when i pick up the grooming brush what a treat
positive,5/9/21,very good tastes like original jack links only with a little more flavor very tender and not dry but a little on the salty side the bag is huge though and there is a tiny amount in the bag it s disappointing
positive,25/5/21,after having been diagnosed with a thyroid nodule which later turned out to be cancer i thought i had better try to get more iodine in my and my family s diet after researching some i found that dulse is a great natural source of iodine i tried a package of this and found that it is pretty good the package came with a suggestion to stir fry it a few minutes in a hot skillet to make it like chips which i tried i and my family enjoyed it much better that way the quality of this dulse is great and the price seemed comparable with others i could find i ordered more of this and am using it as a regular supplement to our diet
positive,7/9/21,this is a must have snack if you like lemonheads and almonds you can t go wrong i found these in walgreens so i decided to give them a try i was hooked they are addicting i have been looking all over for the lemonhead almonds luckily amazon came to the rescue and i was able to purchase two bags you won t regret buying them yummy
positive,11/9/21,my son loves this food combination and eats it without any complaints the ingredients are simple and the taste is straightforward no funky baby food smell like the normal food in jars often has i will buy again and again
positive,13/7/21,the taste of this balsamic vingear is very good for the price vinegar comes in a spray bottle wonderful for salads cuts down on waste when you added to anything else vinegar comes in a six pack each bottle ounces price for six pack but some of the very best sells for over a ounce bottle i never tasted that quality but like i stated earlier delallo tastes deliteful its made in italy
positive,22/7/21,being diabetic i always carry one of these little delicious no added sugar snacks in my purse in case i need a pick me up to prevent low blood sugar another thing in its favor is this snack is gluten free ordering from amazon is fast and they always seem to have the food products that i need
positive,22/6/21,these cookies not only taste great but they are prepackaged so you can just throw them in a lunchbox when you have a child on a gluten free diet saving time on food prep is always appreciated they are definitely a favorite in my house we love them they are small in size but are the best tasting chocolate chip cookie so far that we have found gluten free
positive,28/7/21,these chips make a wonderful snack they give you the crunch and saltiness that you need at times without a lot of calories they also contain protein to keep you from getting hungry again until meal time they came in a single serving size package which is nice when you are mindful of portion control i would order them again
positive,13/10/21,these treats are great the dog is crazy about them they are small but he really likes them you can also use them to conceal small pills if you need to give your dog medicine
positive,19/2/21,i ordered the hot mix by mistake because i didn t read carefully enough it didn t matter this mix is great and not burn your face off hot which i hate super easy and quick to make and very tasty highly recommended

positive,26/3/21,if you like spicy then these are the snack crackers for you so hard to find anywhere else a really good price on here
positive,24/3/21,amber our golden retriever ate this food right up she gave it stars and said it was delicious we noticed that the food is puffed up that s neither good or bad just an observation i suppose if you have limited storage space it would be an issue the food we normally give her is definitely more compact and less airy
positive,24/2/21,i bought this vita coco pure coconut water for my husband he loves it he tryed all different kind of coconut drinks but there were with some preservatives and other junks there were not tasty at all this one taste great and is healthy
positive,19/2/21,i love this stuff i could drink it all day long nice and smooth going down and extremely refreshing the amount you get for the price is just perfect i have caught flack because it is expensive but this is the best coconut water on the market
positive,14/12/20,shipping was fast the taste is great and reminds me of drinking from a real chilled green coconut on the sidewalk in thailand
positive,18/5/21,an other reviewer was right these are better then wheat thins and i bought those for a long time for the crunch i think it s the sea salt that makes them tastier
positive,19/2/21,i have been trying to give up soda and i found that the sparkling ice spring water is a great substitute love the taste bob
positive,14/12/20,kraft homestyle mayonnaise is rich and creamy a very good quality mayonnaise i will certainly buy more of same previously i ve bought mayonnaise that sits in the fridge for ages maybe for generations this mayonnaise will go fast because it taste so good i ve used on tuna hard boiled eggs and salad i highly recommend
positive,1/6/21,i always have a case or two of maruchan ramen in the pantry their shrimp flavor is especially good i always drain the soup off the noodles before i serve them i especially like it with some spinach sauteed with an onion and a head of garlic seriously try it it s remarkably flavorful and costs next to nothing or just the noodles with some chopped green onion to dress them up or with a little curry powder i ve tried top ramen in the past but prefer maruchan
positive,1/4/21,this is a very good product and comes very close to fresh from the kitchen but breaking the clumps adding the water to get the right consistency isn t as easy as one would think
positive,15/4/21,this is a very nice green tea i had to try it since i love anything mango the flavor is perfect whether its hot or iced or with some creamer it smells amazing as well just like a real mango i d like it if the packing was more eco friendly like celestial seasonings but its still pretty nice the packets are individually sealed and there are no staples on on the bag so you don t get any weird taste added to the tea
positive,19/5/21,my kids love hamburger helper so i figured this would be a great new product to try since anything with velveta is good it was easy to make and only took a few minutes to complete the kids absolutely loved it and i thought it tasted great too my only complaint was that visually it was unappetizing it didn t look like the picture on the box it was kind of a grayish brown color and actually worried me a bit before i tried it luckily my kids and i don t really care how it looks so we all enjoyed it but kraft would benefit by working on presentation
positive,19/2/21,having a busy schedule i can appreciate an easy boxed meal to cook every now and then i d have to say i prefer this brand to hamburger helper because of the taste and the quality of the product instructions were easy to follow the food was tasty and it s a nice back up to have in the pantry when you don t feel like making a meal from scratch
positive,14/12/20,my husband loves velveeta shells and cheese so we had to try these very quick and easy don t need anything but the meat but you may want to add a salad or some veggies for a round dinner
positive,28/7/21,this is pretty tasty if you eat this sort of thing and i ll admit it s a rare guilty pleasure for me as compared to the brand that is no doubt its main competitor i thought this one tasted better probably because of the already mixed almost cheese sauce that is included which also replaces the milk that s usually added it s pretty much a toss up in terms of nutrition given that we aren t looking at a nutritional champ to begin with here as prepared this one has calories per serving the other this has calories from fat the other this one has mg of sodium the other one has the kraft velveeta cheesy skillet comes out slightly ahead overall with protein of g compared to the other s g and dietary fiber of g compared to less than a gram for the competitor these differences are probably attributable to the cheese sauce the sauce also pushes this one over the edge for total fat with g for this one and for the other after the ground beef is added the difference is of the recommended daily amount vs virtually none of it good fat in either one it is significant that although both brands claim zero transfat both also list partially hydrogenated oil as one of their ingredients meaning they certainly do contain transfat just less than the half gram per serving that would require full disclosure if you eat the whole package about cups so realistically with a dinner and a leftover lunch or two you easily might you could get whacked with as much as g of transfat not to mention the saturated fat in the ground beef you add to both at grams of sodium you probably need to skip another meal that day to avoid going over the recommended daily value for sodium too you might consider fasting that day if you plan to eat more than one serving but as i said it s a guilty pleasure by definition that s not the most nutritionally sound choice that can be made in any case all other things price availability being equal i will probably choose this one if i choose it again
positive,29/6/21,i was skeptical to buy this because i ve bought cheap coffee before i m always disappointed with its taste this tastes great and the environmental factor is just a bonus for me
positive,15/10/21,i ordered this delicious kadayif dessert for my sister s birthday with her present that i also bought it at amazon took them to my parents house to celebrate at their house everyone at the party enjoyed this delicious kadayif i served it with some turkish coffee it was the best dessert i ever tried everyone said where did i buy it from i said amazon of course they have anything and everything you want to get quality exceptional prices very low my son told everybody that i live in amazon website because i m there looking at it everyday to catch those bargains thank you amazon as allways bringing us the international flavors to our homes
positive,20/7/21,this was a very pleasant surprise i was a bit hesitant when i read through the ingredients sure it sounded healthy but would it taste good in a word outstanding good crunch flavor and just the right amount of salt great to see that there s snack foods available that are a lot better for you than the usual chips and nachos the only problem is that everyone likes them so they disappear quickly
positive,12/10/21,i love tortilla chips just good old fashioned corn chips with salt on them i was curious as to how these fancy tortilla chips would fare before even tasting these chips the bag shows that the company is serious about freshness it s tough and a little slippery i almost couldn t open it by hand the chips are little hexagons about in diameter with the various seeds clearly visible in the chips while the corn flavor is dominant the various other elements of these chips really blend well to give them a unique flavor they re not overly salty indeed if i had any quibble it s that a little more salt would be appreciated these chips would be an excellent choice for finger foods for a higher end dinner party a date or just an evening when you want to treat yourself
positive,19/2/21,i liked the flavor and texture of the tortillas they are not spicy but the taste is not bland because of the olives the chips are small and the serving size in the bag is just enough for a quick satisfying snack
positive,14/12/20,these chip crackers were very tasty however people who have allergies or problems digesting corn like me need to beware if you just read the front of the packet it seems as if they are made without wheat or corn not true the main ingredient is corn
positive,2/7/21,these chips are great tasting you have to try them if you like sweet potatoes
positive,11/3/21,i am munching on these chips as i type trying to keep the salt off my fingers and from going on the keys i like the way they taste the flavors are mainly of stone ground corn but you can tell there are other ingredients as well there s a nice nutty aftertaste i like texture too just the right amount of crunch these chips aren t overly salty either another plus nutrition wise these chips rank among the more healthy versions there are only calories in a one ounce serving a lot less than the normal i see on similar products and the amount of fat and sodium is a lot lower too it s got g of fiber of an average daily requirement there are no trans fats cholesterol preservatives etc it seems that the foodshouldtastegood company made a sincere effort to produce as healthy a product as was possible given the ingredients and requirement to make something that tastes good one reviewer said the chips were too hard and tasted stale my own experience was that the chips tasted fresh and were crunchy but by no means any harder or crunchier than a regular tortilla chip the expiration date on the bag is in november with no preservatives it seems odd that the bag the other reviewer tried had an expiration date more than a year away my only hesitation would be the price currently these chips aren t in stock on amazon and there is no pricing given so i would say you d have to evaluate whether or not you wanted to pay that much for chips even though they seem better for your health than other brands and they taste good as well
positive,10/4/21,i just got home from a long trip and was faced with making dinner luckily the velveeta cheesy skillet dinner was sitting in my pantry i browned a pound of chicken breast strips and followed the directions it was a quick and easy dinner for the family and everyone enjoyed it the ingredients come in different packets the pasta orzo i think seasonings dehyrated broccoli and velveeta cheese sauce after browning the chicken just add the seasoning and pasta along with about cups of water and cover in about or minutes add the dehydrated broccoli and cook another minutes then remove from heat and add the cheese sauce my kids loved it and there was plenty for everyone i found it to be better tasting than chicken helper and easier to prepare my only complaint was the miniscule amount of broccoli it was more like a sprinkling of dried parsley than broccoli florets of course you can always add your own fresh or frozen broccoli or other veggies to make it healthier and heartier overall a good choice for a hectic night when you don t have much time to cook and a lot of hungry little mouths to feed
positive,22/7/19,wanted apricots to try making gluten free granola while i would have preferred unsulphered apricots they are so nasty looking i didn t think my family would eat them everyone loves these very good price too
positive,2/2/20,i mix this seasoning with hunts bbq sauce and the mix taste great on chicken the only problem this product has is that if the enviroment you live is a bit humid the seasoning absorbs the humidity of the ambient and hardens
positive,2/2/20,i ve made these for friends both gluten intolerant and not and everybody loves these they do not taste like they re gluten free excellent job by nuffins to mix convenience with quality and health
positive,31/8/19,great tasting rich flavor perfect for making a nice hot cup of mocha i bought this to test it against hershey s syrup for my mocha and there is an incredible distinct taste difference that is noticeable this is much richer and tastes more like chocolate and less sugary then hershey s syrup
positive,22/7/19,gerber s peach cobbler tastes amazing just like real peach cobbler but without the added sugars and butter my husband and i tried it to see why our daughter liked it so much and we quickly figured out that it was the best tasting baby food we ve purchased and at a great price
positive,12/1/20,this soup is quick and tasty microwaves in no time let it sit a few minutes so the tofu and seaweed can mature to full blossom i purchased thinking it was a miso soup but it is not at least related to the miso soups i get at my local oriental restaurants
positive,19/2/20,will definitely buy again i sent this to a deployed soldier who shared it with the other boys and they all love it great flavour
positive,27/11/19,while these are expensive for the calories they are one of few foods that can actually be eaten before strenuous exercises such as biking i also like these at am when i am rolling out of my sleeping bag to summit a mountain very tasty indeed
positive,12/12/19,this is really yummy instant coffee i like the fine powdery texture however i am not convinced it is organic coffee as the amazon description states the can does not say anything regarding organic ingredients maybe since it is produced outside the us it s not labeled as such but i will not be re ordering due to that
positive,26/9/20,these taste fantastic and amazon sells them for a less expensive price than my local health food store thank you amazon
positive,22/7/19,these grapes are very tasty the right mixture of sweet and tart very light and so good i ate the whole bag in day i will purchase it again
positive,2/2/20,coffee flavor is so personal i love the taste of this coffee i gave one to a friend at work and he thought it was much to strong he freely admits that he has no problem drinking the company supplied coffee that sits in the big metal coffee urn all day my other friend drinks this kona blend black and he loves it i m not a huge coffee snob i drink maxwell house french roast at home i look forward to having a good tasting cup of coffee at work and this really fits the bill i put sweetener and cream in my coffee so it s important to get coffee that has flavor can stand up to the added ingredients even with cream and sugar the flavor is bold and smooth
positive,23/5/20,the chocorooms are so good and tasty with no cholesterol the kids love them and they are a perfect size for them to think they are getting a lot of sweets
positive,22/11/20,these were pretty tasty they do not stick in your teeth like other fruit snacks which is a huge plus but even better they re all natural and good for you i ll buy them again for sure soon when this box runs out
positive,30/3/20,you can smell the spinach it seems fresh and tastes wonderful i fed it to my nd son when we were on the go during his babyfood stage and gave it to my preschooler as a snack now both often reach for these as a snack and i m happy to offer them something other than cheerios or graham crackers when we re on the go
positive,8/7/20,my son loves these pouches it is a quick and easy way to get fruits and veggies into a picky eater he loves the flavor and will grab these from me and eat the entire pouch i love that it is organic and healthy the fruits overpower the veggies which helps in making the flavor more acceptable to younger children it is easy to grab on the way out of the door as a quick snack or as a complement to eating out i highly recommend
positive,4/1/20,they used to carry a large jar of this at a local store but i never saw it again after a few years ago and was deeply saddened it is delicious with brie on a cracker though i found out i am allergic to dairy so no more for me but it can also be used as a glaze eaten on french bread toast or in spoonfuls from the jar i love this stuff i only wish it came in a big tub that would last you the rest of your life
positive,30/1/21,this was the first time we ve had tings a friend told us about them and since since they ended up being per bag we gave them a shot my daughter has a severe milk intolerance and i have a wheat allergy and it s rare to find something delicious that we can both have my daughter is years old and can now enjoy cheetos just like her friends and they taste wonderful i m so thankful for products like these that taste good help us feel normal and are affordable if i could give stars i would
positive,17/10/20,since i m vegetarian i don t use meat with this but rather a bunch of portobello mushrooms and a whole onion turns out fantastic and the leftovers are even better the next day could use a few more noodles in the box but i just buy egg noodles separately and add a few
positive,22/7/19,i had these when in the phillippines and then when i came had to have some more even though this a large bag we go through these fast in about two weeks
positive,2/2/20,much fresher than the usual sun maid i buy at store less sugar too so they taste at a much higher quality i will continue to buy these in bulk to save hopefully the seller is reading my interview and sends me a code for discount since i gave a generous review
positive,4/10/20,it s somewhat hard to find a macadamia syrup but i happen to love this particular flavor my first order off amazon of a different brand broke and was then discontinued so i gave this one a try and i m happy i did it s quite tasty and comes with a pump which is a nice touch there are quite a few servings in each bottle and it s perfect for italian soda also from a practical standpoint they are using plastic bottles for the shipped product which makes it much less likely to break in transit
positive,1/4/20,this is absolutely delicious my husband has had it on vanilla ice cream every night since it arrived just the right blend of chocolate and raspberry
positive,8/5/20,i love blueberry coffee and this was very good but if you purchase do not get whole bean get it ground before they send it the oils in the flavoring make it tough on some grinders
positive,18/6/20,i bought this product from vitacost i really enjoyed the fresh healthy flavor i decided to purchse from amazon because it s in bulk thereore cheaper it sso worht it i ve tried a lot this mix really impressed me no chocolate to melt in the car
positive,20/8/20,my husband and i love this ketchup to me the taste is better than the regular heinz ketchup the color and texture are exactly the same but the flavor is better you can t beat organic
positive,1/6/21,the spice and flavor go hand in hand so i usually add all of the flavor packet i make these slightly soupy and i often discard a little of the broth to reduce sodium levels spare my digestive tract from the ravages of my taste buds also great and more of a meal with egg stirred in near the end i could eat these every day but alas that would have dire consequences taking the nutritional drawbacks as a given these are for price flavor
positive,4/7/21,if you like spicy noodles and don t really feel like taking time to make it this comes really close instant noodle at its best just boil some water toss the noodles in add some vegie kamaboko tofu whatever you like and have that will actually look like a fancy bowl of noodles when you are done in less than mins
positive,5/2/20,they re not for the faint of heart i get so bored with most foods that claim to be spicy hot but shin ramyun delivers and it s not just hot it s got great taste i ve been buying them by the pack for years and loving every bite
positive,22/7/19,this ramen is so good i also bought the neoguri also a good choice if you like seafood i would highly recommend this it microwaves well i use pyrex i m deployed on a ship and it was sent out here pretty quick relatively speaking ok lol and none of the ramen was damaged during vertrep it is spicy definitely seriously spicy i cook it with minimal water so it stays that way i love it will buy again it s pretty much the highlight of my day
positive,2/2/20,i enjoy these noodles over most other noodles it s spicy enough to make my nose run which i like and the noodles have a nice texture to them
positive,22/11/20,this is a knockout bold coffee it is great cup at the oz setting with tons of flavor haven t tried it yet at the oz setting but assume it will still pack a flavor punch great deal in the pack
positive,1/3/20,if you like bold taste then add it to your cart because you will love this coffee this is one of my variety that i choose on a morning i need a jump start or a lecture from my mom ha
positive,5/4/21,rarely can i say that a gf product tastes better than the gluten version thse cookies do though melt in your mouth delicious and just the right amount of lemon i am confident tht if you gave these to gluten eaters they would not be able to tell the difference
positive,27/4/20,these little cookies taste fantastic not too sweet just right chocolate melts easily so we will be ordering these in the cooler months only
positive,8/3/21,this product is very tasty but if you are also lactose intolerant better forgo the pleasure milk is not listed on the allergy advisory may contain traces of but the ingredients section lists whole milk powder as a component of the chocolate coating otherwise it s a great product
positive,30/1/20,this was beyond my expectations the variety was a great blend of different soups and so easy to fix even my husband liked them i quickly ordered another set because it was so good tasty and easy
positive,2/2/20,this tea has the real flavor of pumpkin it is nicely spiced and perfect for an autumn afternoon it is quite highly caffeinated so i do not drink it late at night but overall a lovely tea
positive,2/9/20,this fondant was very smooth and easy to work with along with having a good taste you don t always get good taste in fondant
positive,26/1/21,definitely a very good jerky not dry or chewy at all very tasty did not need any extra flavoring we went thru the packs pretty fast even though they were supposed to last a while
positive,9/1/21,we use this popcorn in an air popper on the weekends it is delicious and tastes much better than anything we have been able to find in the stores
positive,30/7/21,i was looking for a hulless popcorn due to my diverticulitis boy do i miss popcorn and tried this based on the reviews i was disappointed that this has way to many hulls for me the hulls do not disappear or get so small but the flavor of the popcorn is amazing very very tasty my family loves it so i will buy it again we air popped it sprayed it with a little cooking oil and sprinkled some popcorn flavored seasoning butter hardly any calories but lots of taste they are tiny when they pop so you really should not flood it with anything heavy or it will turn to mush
positive,30/10/20,i bought this from my local health food store it has a wonderful coconut taste i use it in everything from my morning oatmeal to yogurt i put some in my dogs food and their coats have been so shiny and soft i also suffer from a dry flakey scalp so i massage a small amount into my hair and let it sit for minutes before i shampoo it out it leaves my hair so soft and shiny it is a great waterproof mascara remover too i will be buying this item in bulk i love all the benefits coconut oil has to offer
positive,3/8/20,these almonds are the best i love the tasted but was not quite as zippy or strong as i had hoped i do eat lots of hot items so perhaps my taste buds are expecting more having said that the flavor and freshness is tops
positive,29/1/21,this was my first time ordering from this company they re fast and a great product will def be ordering more flavorings in the future
positive,24/10/21,this is a great olive oil great price i love colavita products in general delivery was fast shipping was a bit pricey
positive,24/10/21,this is a really great product not sweet at all the name describes it perfectly however i am not sure why it is a case i would buy it in the store much cheaper
positive,16/10/21,this has a strong granny smith apple taste i eat apples all the time so if anyone says otherwise they are mistaken same texture just a different and better taste now i m purchasing three packs a week because it taste so good tasty enough to substitute an unhealthy dessert for this tasty treat
positive,24/10/21,very good flavor and not filled with a bunch of chemicals although there are still questions about some of the ingredients it is a great alternative to what s on the shelf in the grocery store
positive,25/9/21,a must for anyone who loves to cook this sauce along with the raspberry chipotle are so tasty and add a nice twist to spice up otherwise boring chicken and steak also makes a nice and cost effective gift
positive,19/10/21,the coffee has a bold without bitterness taste it is very delicious i enjoy drinking grove square coffee dark roast every morning
positive,20/10/21,i wasn t too sure about trying this product because the price seemed too good to be true gluten free products are usually so much more expensive what a pleasant surprise we really liked it we really liked it seriously this product is worth a try i used it for a base for lasagne and for a change from the regular spaghetti noodles delicious
positive,19/10/21,i just found pb and pb with chocolate and i am thrilled i love sugary goodies but i m not a fan of calories and i don t like chocolate i thought i d try pb with chocolate anyway and i m so glad i did eating a serving or two of pb with chocolate satisfies my sweet craving without breaking my calorie bank sometimes when i want to splurge i spread some pb with chocolate on a graham cracker spread some marshmallow fluff on another and sandwich them together yum
positive,15/6/21,the chocolate pb is just as amazing as the regular pb plus a healthy indulgence i love to use it as a dip for animal crackers also great on apple wedges
positive,4/8/21,this product tastes great i use it in my protien shakes to help mask the tastes of some of the flavors i have tried and do not like with the pb i now like the taste of the shakes and use this every day i prefer the pb with coco powder but both products taste great
positive,4/8/21,i order this because of the other reviews it is really good went to their website to get more receipes
positive,18/7/21,i used to purchase these at my local wal mart but they do not carry them anymore and when i looked at other stores they were soooo expensive i decided to check online and was able to order them at a reasonable price and received them pretty quick now i am a happy and content customer
positive,18/10/21,i sent this collection of italian cheeses to my daughter and needless to say she was delighted they were excellent formaggio del cucina italian cooking cheeses pound by igourmet com
positive,4/8/21,this is one of my favorite kinds of coffee for my keurig it has a nice dark taste that is not overpowering while still being strong my mother hates strong coffee and when she comes to my house she will resuse one of these k cups after i ve made mine to knock the punch out whatever your pleasure i guess
positive,8/6/21,for those of you who drink coffee black i think you are going to love this blend of coffee it is very delicious and has a great bold flavor
positive,15/6/21,i love tazo teas i do not really like friuty ones but this one is okay it is tart so i have to over sweeten it its not one ove my favs
positive,4/8/21,i like this and will order again just a little spice and sweetness the corn flakes are actually fried so they remind me of a thin corn chip rather than breakfast cereal
positive,25/9/21,the whole family even those who are not gf loves the flavor of this mac cheese tastes like the kraft velveeta cheese shells we made the recipe on the box which was yummy
positive,19/10/21,i love popcorn we have popcorn about nights a week i started out looking for popcorn on the cob as i had that this year and it was lovely and then stumbled upon india tree it s the closest that i can find to the dried on the cob popcorn and i love it it is so fresh and natural tasting i ve been using it for several months and ran out the other day and had to use a popular store brand though the kernals popped up larger the taste was stale and processed not to mention the india tree popcorn is actually cheaper than the store brand i m placing my order for more india tree right now
positive,4/9/21,although a little crumbly these are very tasty for a rice cake i would definately get them again simple taste but sweet enough to stave off an after lunch craving
positive,31/8/21,this rice is delicious vegetarian and easy to make i usually add some extra vegetables to it but other than that it s perfect just as it is calories cup g servings per pouch total fat g no saturated or trans fat cholesterol mg sodium mg potassium mg total carbs g fiber g sugar g protein g
positive,9/10/21,very fresh tasting and refreshing better than any other brand i have tried a good buy if you get it delivered on a regular basis short reviews not wanted by amazon
positive,15/6/21,after trying many different brands and being totally disappointed i reluctantly tried taste nirvana it tasted great refreshing not too sweet and mildly nutty coconut flavor signed up for monthly delivery that says it all
positive,15/6/21,my husband loves these they are easy to make and yield consistent results easy to customize the strength by just using more or less water we bring a few packets when we go away on weekend trips buying in bulk here is definitely cheaper than buying at the store cheers
positive,4/8/21,as we sample many flavors of k cups from amazon com a few stand out and timothy s world coffee italian blend stood out it has a fantastic flavor rich and delicious i recommended it to one of my co workers and they enjoyed it as well this will be one of my stock items from now on
positive,15/6/21,i ll admit on the advice of my trainer i was not excited about adding protein shakes to my daily regiment i was pleasingly surprised by the taste though it s difficult to get the powder to dissolve in water but mixing it with soy milk and shaking it up did well for me it also fills me up for a time between meals while providing me the protein i was lacking
positive,4/8/21,i m glad i bought these before the price rose from to they re good but not worthy of such a large price hike if the cost returns to a reasonable value i ll consider buying them again
positive,1/10/21,took a chance on this peanut butter because it was a great price turns out it s also great tasting too and i used it to make cookies loved the smoothe texture no separation and definitely lots of peanuts
positive,1/7/18,i purchased this to use on my hair and it has done wonders for my hair i purchased other brands after i purchased this brand and by far it s the best i also eat a teaspoon of this everyday and it taste so yummy if you are looking for coconut oil that tastes great and works wonders for your hair all at a good price then this is the one for you you will not be disappointed i just received my second order of vitacost coconut oil i love this stuff i now use it for stir frying veggies frying up burgers i even fried chicken with this oil and it came out great this brand by far beats all the other brands on the market in value and taste and if you suffer from dry skin especially during the cold winter months just whip this with some shea butter and apply to your skin your skin will thank you for it
positive,10/8/18,it s great for making popcorn in my stir crazy popper we bought it because it s suppose to be really good for you i ll let you know in years if it made me live longer
positive,1/7/18,i bought this green tea because it is organic i knew i was getting a healthy product but what i got was much more the taste is really good it is fresh smooth and full bodied you will be pleased with this high quality tea what a nice surprise note this bigelow product comes bags to a box and tea bags to a wrapper
positive,10/8/18,this tastes great i love it in my coffee and have even used it for pancakes it really doesn t give me a spike in blood sugar as promised the only negative is the packaging they are using during shipping some of the seals underneath the lids came off and the bottles leaked i probably lost about a tablespoon each from of the bottles the lids don t really fit the bottles either they have a pop top but if you use it the syrup sometimes leakes out from under the lid where it attaches to the bottle if they could fix the bottles this would definitely be a five star product update the product was not available for a few months and when it came back new packaging my last shipment was sealed up tight five stars for sure but amazon won t let me change that part
positive,13/9/18,i think this is a great tasting product use in coffee every day i am saying goo bye to white sugar
positive,17/7/18,i have been using this for a year now very good in tea i use it on anything my son puts it on his cereal he is a very picky eater and he has no clue it isn t real sugar i put it on my pancakes yuuuuummyyyy

positive,1/7/18,we have purchased this on amazon and had it shipped to our son s dorm room in college a great way to send snacks spend over and shipping is free
positive,10/8/18,i found this once in a store but they don t carry it any more i am so thankful that amazon com carrys it my son says it s his favorite meal
positive,15/2/20,i order this for my office and everyone loves it i think its a great low cal alternative to chips and such
positive,22/4/21,more of a cross between a cracker and a cookie i love these they have a very distinct flavor that both my wife and i enjoy as well as the kids trust me to find a snack that everyone likes in our family is no small task but we are very happy with the newtons fruit thins fig and honey and look forward to trying other flavors
positive,25/9/20,these fruit thins are very tasty they are loaded with figs which are loaded with vitamin b they are also not nausiatingly over sweetened which is great for us diabetics i really liked these cookies and plan to buy them again
positive,16/11/19,this newton product is a good adaptation of a cracker the fruit is in the product but it is thin and chewy my year old enjoyed it also i would highly recommend it for adults youth and children the idea of making this type of change shows creativity and ingenuity with such a wonderful brand
positive,9/9/20,these treats were surprisingly tasty and filling calories per serving cookies but the cookies were really the perfect size for a light snack these had more of a gingerbread taste than a honey taste but that isn t a bad thing allergy alert contains soy product
positive,1/7/18,at first i thought i wouldn t like these i like fig newtons but i don t love them however i couldn t be more pleased first of all my first bite tasted like an oatmeal cookie i immediately checked the ingredients and yep there s oats in there absolutely delicious there are bits and pieces of fig scattered throughout the cookie or thin but it s not like a spread now i am not sure if it s supposed to be spread between thins but its like spots of fig here and there and the fig is kind of hard and chewy but fortunately or unfortunatley there is very little fig so it s not that big of a deal i couldn t taste the honey but that s ok i absolutely love oatmeal cookies and it tasted like that they are a nice size and crisp i dunked them in my tea and they were delicious my hubby hates fig and i slipped these in his lunch and he loved them too he didn t even taste the fig these are very good however if you really really want to taste fig get the regular fig newtons
positive,10/8/18,these are good but i think i was spoiled by the blueberry flavor they are my favorite i like the whole line because they use better quality ingredients these are delicious but i d like more figs
positive,15/1/20,i have been a david seeds fan since i was a kid i did not think anyone could beat their seeds since trying bigs seeds buffalo wing i now have a new favorite the seeds are a little spicy but you can eat a whole bag wihout it leaving your tongue raw i have tried all the flavors but buffalo wing is my favorite try them you will be surprised i am not a young kid i have years of sunflower seed eating experience
positive,1/9/20,would have given it five stars but the product needs to be inch away from perfection for that to happen all in all it does what i needed it to do and in spectacular fashion
positive,22/7/21,of the plum tots pouches i have had this is by far the best tasting these are a little pricey but when they are on sale they are worth every penny great for throwing in a diaper bag or purse
positive,1/7/18,i discovered these when my daughter was about months old i wish i had found them earlier they are organic taste great are easy for toddlers to handle and very convenient i always keep some in my purse and in the car when we re out and about they are not messy unless of course they decide to squeeze the pouch which only happens for us when she s not hungry the plum organics line also includes some varieties with fruits and vegetables mixed together they taste surprisingly good and are one way to get my picky eater to eat some veggies you can find some varieties at reasonable prices on amazon others are more expensive for some reason babies r us has had a sale every other month or so where you can get them for each if you buy them in sets of that is usually when i stock up for the next two months
positive,10/8/18,i am a very satisfied customer in which will purchase again i couldn t receive them fast enough thank you
positive,14/5/21,i am pretty happy with this product it has a good taste the peanut is clear and not burnt and like the low sodium in it i don t miss sugar in it pulling all that other stuff out brings the peanut flavor forward my one negative is that it s not as silky as i d like maybe just a tad too low on oil
positive,17/10/19,bars tasted good were fresh and i am pooping better i would recommend this product to anyone and they are cheap
positive,3/10/21,i don t know why other people are complaining about the taste i mixed it with almond milk and really liked it maybe the flavors go well together in any case it tastes a lot like every other protein powder i ve tried except without the disgusting synthetic sweetness
positive,15/9/20,these snacks are so fresh and tasty i have never had any snacks that are fresher than these after trying the first bag of mareblue snacks they became our favorites for everyone in the family they are not very sweet but just right for our taste thank goodness for mareblue now we have a great snack that is healthy and tasty

positive,1/7/18,this product tastes just like peanut butter so a great alternative for those with a peanut allergy or for children who attend peanut free schools my granddaughter could not taste the difference we all use this product now and love it
positive,10/8/18,i have a home daycare and have a child allergic to nuts i ordered this because we couldn t fool the kids with our local alternative sunbutter i had two toddlers that would go without before they would eat sunbutter because they could tell it wasn t peanut butter i ordered this without putting much hope into it as i ve tried several and could never trick the pickiest kiddos i was pleasantly suprized when i served this and not a one kid could tell it wasn t the real thing i m glad i ordered such a large quantity i will be using this from now one it is by far the best alternative out there a huge bonus is the fact that there aren t a bunch of additives anything that uses cane sugar and sea salt always sit better with me anyway great product
positive,5/12/19,good stuff if you are allergic to peanut butter tastes the same to me but i am not that picky although it did give me the same heartburn as peanut butter so i stopped using it it may be that i cannot digest high fat foods of this type not the product itself
positive,21/10/19,very good maple syrup i use it daily in place of sugar the no drip spout is very nice
positive,8/9/20,thank you king arthur for this wonderful mix i enjoy baking however after being diagnosed with celiac disease last year it kind of took the fun out of baking for me but with this mix the baker is back these cookies are exceptional my gluten consuming friends couldn t tell the difference can t wait to try the other products please keep developing more new gluten free mixes
positive,22/9/21,this cereal packs a flavorful punch the blueberry oat clusters are divine i only wish it had less sugar but even then its not at all overly sweet
positive,2/10/20,this is what you need to make your gumbo taste the way it should it is difficult to find in stores and i was happy to be able to get it from amazon
positive,25/7/20,this is the best salad dressing i ve ever had it really does taste like bruschetta and since it s oil based instead of cream it s way healthier five stars

positive,4/7/21,i grew up on this juice in england the lemon flavor was the original look for the orange and black currant mmmmmm it is great in the usa you don t tend to find what we call cordials so much it is a economical way of getting a great tasting juice it is so concentrated it goes a long way i have a soda stream again something i grew up with in the uk and i make a lot of club soda with it i then add a small amount of barley water and it is so refreshing i love it
positive,21/9/21,i was never a pop tart fan but on a lark and due to the coupon i tried these i was pleasantly surprised at how good they tasted i would prefer more filling as you can barely taste it the frosting is very light and adds a perfect sweetness one package w coffee is a perfect quick breakfast since amz is now out of stock for this flavor i ordered the apple frosted ones i think the unfrosted might be too flavorless for me
positive,11/9/21,i have always been pretty picky about my poptarts so i wasn t sure if these were going to taste like cardboard or not when i first got them they are great poptarts my kids love them
positive,12/10/21,we love pop tarts the name brand ones but wanted to get away from all the chemicals food dyes and especially hfcs that those are loaded with these are a great substitute
positive,11/10/21,having to ditch pop tarts for their extensive list of ingredients including trans fat i first bought the strawberry ones of this brand i loved them and bought and entire case here then i decided to try blueberry both are great but i liked strawberry better the only bad thing is that they have a lot of sugar g each
positive,28/9/21,i love to have soup for lunch and as a result i like to have a variety of soups available this soup is very good
positive,19/10/21,when i was first introduced to this product and business opportunity i was a little skeptical about it but after i started drinking it i really like it i experienced good things i did not get any coffee jitters and crashes plus i lost some weight like most people experience so i decided to sign up as a representive so i can get it the products at wholesale then as time goes i check my website and there were alot of people as my downline then i relized that this business is really growing whether i do anything or not so i decided to purchase the bronze promotional package and i started getting on this business my upline and leaders are a great help and i am pretty much just trying to duplicate their success and its working i have just upgraded to the silver promotional package to really get my business growing i have made all my investment money back and some in the short time that i have been involved in og considering that i do not do much i just give people samples and show them the business opportunity if you like to know more about this business give me a email at zang xiong hotmail com i am more then happy to share this opportunity with anyone that is interested and looking to change their lifes

positive,12/9/21,this is excellent coffee a bit strong which i personally like price is good enough for this quality
positive,13/7/21,this is a great snack easy to prepare in the microwave just make sure you bring it to a boil or it has a slimey texture tastes way better than instant in our opinion
positive,23/10/21,wanted my daughter to keep organic as much and long as possible so we tried this brand first this veggie when she started solids it smells and looks bright and from the first spoonfull it s not so runny it won t stay on a spatula style spoon she loved it this is a veggie she doesn t refuse she ll eat a jar of this even after a full bottle if i let her no side effects noticed and i even tasted it found it barely sweet and wholesome this is a great deal and cheaper than in store arrives bubblewrapped to death and no weird or broken jars so far
positive,22/9/21,it tastes pretty good i mix it in a single serve blender with water chia seeds that s been soaking in the water for min a banana an apple and sometimes frozen mixed berries don t mix it with coconut water i tried that and it tasted horrible i bought this at first at whole foods but amazon is much cheaper especially with the subscription program
positive,4/7/21,i love this green mix i mix it with almond milk half a frozen banana and a whole pack of frozen acai and use it as a meal replacement love it
positive,11/9/21,i honestly was scared of ordering this as some of the reviews are less than positive about the taste but seriously it is good if you are already a vegetarian or if veggies are a primary part of your daily diet you will have no problem with the taste it s like eating sweet fresh grass it is gritty but it doesn t bother me at all
positive,8/8/21,grove square cappuccino cups were excellent tasted really good right from the keurig brewer with nothing added wwould highly recommend rccjr
positive,9/7/21,i also bought this product and i can tell you that i received my shipment in a timely manner and it was worth it this cappuccino tastes delicious with no additions like milk cream or sugar just brew it by itself and enjoy the perfect combination of a great cappuccino absolutely worth the price and i saved a ton of by not purchasing from starbuck s
positive,24/10/21,this product is hard to find for us in stores in ohio most k cups are french vanilla coffee not cappuccino its delicious will buy again for sure
positive,4/7/21,wow these k cups are so yummy and perfect if you are on the go they don t require cream and sweetener so just brew and go the only thing i would like better is if they were sugar free using a sugar substitute and were lower fat or fat free they do taste yummy though and for the price you can go wrong
positive,11/9/21,looking for great coffee at a great price this is it k cups are expensive but this coffee is great tasting at a great price when purchased from amazon
positive,24/10/21,this may not be real cappuccino but i am not sure i know what that is this tastes good and i really enjoy a cup of it especially on these chilly mornings
positive,22/6/21,no complaints coffee tasted good and it comes out to less that a cup i personally think it is a bargain
positive,30/7/21,i absolutely love this cappuccino i had my doubts but they were proved wrong i myself have a sweet tooth and i was worried that this product would taste too much like coffee and not enough like a cappuccino but thankfully i was worng and it had the right blend of both i had cups the first day i bought it shared it with my family they loved it too
positive,4/7/21,yummy great tasting and very convenient only drawback is you must clean your machine at least once a week to keep it from clogging just like with hot chocolate

positive,13/10/21,this product is so easy to use make and is delicious reminds me of my trip to the holyland
positive,2/8/21,when i opened the package i thought this tea smells exactly like italian pignoli macaroons but the taste is definitely darker and more bitter perhaps i let it steep too long or perhaps sweetener would bring out the cookie flavor more whatever black it tastes pretty similar to the republic of tea vanilla almond flavor which i also like this tea seems to have bigger leaf pieces and less fannings than typical for bagged teas by the way so it s probably a higher grade of tea underneath the flavorings
positive,11/6/21,this product is a great substitute for sugar in drinks it doesn t have a funny aftertaste or change the taste of the drinks i put it in obviously it s a good alternative for sugar but another reason i purchased it was because of it s benefit on teeth xylitol is used in other countries i ve read to fight tooth decay and improve oral health in adults and children alike you must used grams daily for this benefit my husband and i both use the toothpaste also excellent and gum last week i saw a dentist on primetime tv doing a show on oral health and he strongly recommended xylitol for children also
positive,2/8/21,i recently gave up coffee made the switch to teas i ve tried all the usual suspects lipton other grocery blends were bitter or weak i purchased the loose tea leaves from amazon at a fair price quick shipping english friends suggested pj tips tea which we ordered from another online site twinning s blows it away the earl grey irish blend are great both on the pallet to the nose
positive,18/10/21,delicious loose earl grey tea i use it for making iced tea my favorite check out the adagio ingenuitea brewer available here on amazon for a great tea making setup my only wish is that amazon stocked it in a bigger size i m running out of ideas for things to do with all the dozens of little metal tea boxes i have around the house now good for storing electronic cables screws poker chips etc loose tea is much better than bagged tea more room for the leaves to brew
positive,23/7/21,this product is absolutely delightful they are better than chocolate to me and one taste and you are hooked
positive,8/7/21,great tasting coffee hard to find decaf hazelnut coffee found this at amazon taste great at a reasonable price tried more expenive decaf hazelnut coffee and was disappointed with the taste didn t even taste like hazelnut this is a full bodied hazelnut coffee
positive,11/6/21,i find these are a great alternative to the licorice laces we are all used to the taste and texture seemed very similar to me in fact i like them better because of the lack of the artificial aftertaste would definitely buy again

positive,11/6/21,very tasty product and low fat and natural i have tried most of their flavors and like them all will buy again
positive,8/7/21,this product though expensive along with the shipping is the best tasting non instant i ve tasted add a little vanilla and sugar and it s very drinkable my grandkids call it magic milk the only complaint i have is that one package was received not fully sealed so i had fine powder all over
positive,28/9/21,i purchased single packs from a supermarket i made them by using the provided method but i added eggs the soup base got way too thick for the other pack i did the same but added extra water it was much better
positive,23/8/21,well first got this from grocery at a premium price ordered from amazon and saved some cash just as tasty and definitely worth it this product was one of the contributing factors that led to getting a prime membership
positive,1/8/21,i haven t been able to find this in any store lately i had some a few years ago and it is really good this is more like coffee cake than anything else the swirl is a cinnamon sugar with small pecan pieces and the bread is sort of like yellow cake i m excited to find it on amazon
positive,16/7/21,i love the taste of this i used it to pop my corn in it made the popcorn all buttery i have to deduct a star because when it gets cool it leaves that film that crisco like shortenings do on the roof of your mouth i hate that and it has trans fats
positive,20/8/21,i had never tried blackstrap molasses before and i was expecting not to like the taste after reading many online comments about how awful it tastes and how much it s an acquired taste i bought this from the grocery store since it was on sale and i actually love the taste of it i read on another site that some people thought it tastes like licorice but i don t think it does at all which is good because i hate the taste of licorice the only thing i don t like about this is that it s really messy maybe if it was in a squeeze bottle it would be easier to pour into a measuring spoon
positive,25/8/21,read the ingredients on most cereal boxes then read the kashi boxes what a difference you may never eat a regular cereal again kashi cereals taste better eat better and make a true cereal lover happy
positive,2/8/21,i think this is the best chicken rub ever very tasty and very easy to prepare we are huge fans of roasted chicken so i try different recipes with regularity but find i keep coming back to this one it is a favorite and has never let us down
positive,11/6/21,bought these to try some new recipies but have found they are quite tasty straight out of the can chopped up in my salad
positive,22/10/21,i m not a beef stick beef jerky eater these were bought for my son s school snack however i have eaten a few and really like the beef flavor
positive,6/8/21,if you re looking for authentic thai curry this is it after you ve made the dish a few times you can tailor it to your liking we like it very spicy so we re generous with the portions and add chili flakes and a little madras curry powder buy with confidence and keep your pantry stocked
positive,24/6/21,these little fruit cups of peaches are quite scrumptious being packed in apple juice is so much better than syrup and does not destroy the delicate peach flavor the fruit tastes freshly ripened but not mushy each serving is perfect for one person and can be taken to work or where ever without a problem the price for each pack of is good too for now anyway i highly recommend these little just ounces fruit cups
positive,17/4/21,i m still not a food reviewer the problem is that i can t turn down free coffee that said this is good stuff mellow with none of the bitter edge common with a lot of the cheaper stuff sold at the local grocery store i subtracted one star from the review because of the ridiculously pretentious ad copy on the box drinking this coffee won t fix the world or make your life more fulfilling i m fairly sure
positive,10/3/21,marley coffee one love organic is dark rich and flavorful with good mouth feel and a medium roundness of tone not bitter but there seems to be almost a salty undertone to it that does speak of jamaica and blue mountain although the label does not claim it is blue mountain coffee these packets are about one normal scoopful and can be used in single serving coffee makers but i put one in my cup espresso machine and it was fantastic
positive,17/4/21,i received my order in time the walnuts are very good fresh and delicious there was a slight issue with the package it s a plastic bag there were a couple of small cuts on the bag since the package was left on my front porch for a few hours some ants got into the box fortunately there wasn t enough time for them to really get into the plastic bag overall i m satisfied with this purchase
positive,21/1/21,this stuff is great to make egg dishes special it does add a truffle scent but you must cut down on adding other salt
positive,30/1/21,i m not a coconut oil savant but i got this for my stovetop popcorn popper and it s awesome it s not super greasy very light cooks the popcorn to perfection and leaves an amazing hint of coconut without the sweetness although my husband says it doesn t get the coconut hint but he misses a lot of hints it shipped quickly was well packaged and is a good price i didn t want to buy a ton in case we didn t like it
positive,13/2/21,i have been buying garden of life products for several years now and have tried other coconut oils but still come back to garden of life even though it cost more than other brands it still taste the best
positive,15/1/21,this soup mix is so easy and tastes great that being said i add can of chicken breast can of white kidney beans can of stewed tomatoes and cups of frozen corn i also add another cups of water so it yields much more than servings and is very hearty overall still a great price
positive,6/3/21,i never thought one salt was different from another but wow this salt is special it is very flavorful not fishy it really enhances the flavor of food i add a little salt when i make a sweet food and it brings out the sweetness for example add a little salt to the boiling water before you add the oatmeal yumm fantastic salt
positive,8/6/21,i had tried a tahini before i bought the kevala tahini and i didn t like it at all then i found the kevala tahini on amazon and i decided to give it a try i love it it s rich creamy organic and it tastes good i will probably buy it again
positive,7/1/21,great tasting healthy snack and when i say great tasting i mean it i am very picky about food so it is not great tasting for super health conscious people who only eat bad tasting health bars and it s great to know you are getting a ton of fiber which most of us do not get enough of
positive,17/4/21,i like that these are all individually packages they are great to snack on or share with other great flavors
positive,10/3/21,fast service the items arrived the next day our dog loves them and they make great stocking stuffers for the holidays for our dog and the neighbors
positive,14/1/21,my cats absolutely love all the fancy feast appetizers and this is definitely a favorite flavor they look at me with love when they see me reach for the container and that s the part i like best
positive,24/5/21,tastes great when you combine pack of twinings green tea and pack of lipton black tea in a hot cup of water and add or more teaspoon of sugar make sure to remove the teabags from your cup within few minutes to avoid the strong bitter taste
positive,14/10/21,i like these they are crispy and flavorful also they are very colorful which any cook knows is important when preparing food for others place a bowl of these on the table at your next bbq and just wait for the compliments read the nutrition information and compare it to your favorite potato chips and ask yourself why you would want to ingest all that junk when these chips taste just as good
positive,7/2/21,it was a great gift the recipient loved it he was happy and if he s happy so am i i would definitely do business w these folks again
positive,29/3/21,tinkyada s brown rice elbow pasta is a great tasting gluten free choice it is just like having normal pasta only better it cooks just like any pasta and can be used in any pasta dish i highly recommend this product

positive,10/7/21,this is one of the best protein bars i ve tasted yet that it s vegan and made with more natural ingredients than most bars is a huge plus but the main selling point is that this bar is something you actually want to eat
positive,27/1/21,i got a sample of this item at a food industry show and really enjoyed it it is delicious and nutritious a great way to start a cold morning it is a nice touch that the pouch can be used for measuring the water
positive,20/8/21,i ve been eating raw honey for a while now and this is among the best tasting that i ve tried it was also reasonably priced unlike some of the other raw honey products that give you a tiny jar for the same price or more than i paid for this large pounder
positive,14/8/21,i am a jasmine tea lover might leaf organic spring jasmine is so reasonably priced it has the taste of of a tea that make you believe it is a very expensive exotic chinese tea a cup in the afternoon is so special the foil bag keeps the tea fresh
positive,21/4/21,first of all i was very surprised to get this so fast i just ordered it yesterday and it was at my doorstep before am which never happens anyway i opened it and had a serving and was shocked that it tasted pretty good now for those who have tried vegan drinks you know that they are not always the best tasting thing but this is definitely one of the better drinks i have had i will be reordering this and i will now try the other flavors and hope they are as good as this one
positive,1/4/21,if this is as healthy as it is tasty then a great product a little pricey for only servings but that organic red dutch cocoa is delectable
positive,17/4/21,we do not grill steaks if we are out of this product it really is that good in fact we have turned so many friends onto this after having them over for perfectly grilled meat if you love charred outside and medium rare to medium well done fantastic we have tried several other flavors they have and while they are good this is our favorite by far
positive,10/3/21,i am trying to get away from drinking diet soda so i decided to try sparking water with lemon i love the taste of this brand and amazon has a great price
positive,22/4/21,this is a tasty flavor but not one i could drink everyday the honey flavor makes it a little sweet for my palette but for a dessert coffee it works wonderfully i won t but this for everyday repeated use but it is a good special treat flavor
positive,25/4/21,this is our favorite chicken seasoning sauce add orange juice in a bag along with this sauce chicken pieces and toss easy and the chicken tastes better than el polo loco s
positive,1/4/21,i really like this coffee for both the taste and the size of the cup i can brew one cup and get a full size cup unlike so many of the other selections that only give a small cup of coffee in the mornings i want a full cup of coffee to go i don t want to full around with a small sample besides that the taste suits me we have tried lots of the others but i have since settled on this one for my taste try it i think you will agree with me
positive,30/6/21,this tonic water is the best it does not contain high fructose corn syrup so it tastes better buy it you will not regret it
positive,1/3/21,wow we ve never had so much macaroni and cheese in a long time and annie s is really really good this doesn t need additional milk or butter and the sauce is an easy to squeeze out paste in a foil package it tastes great and makes a great receptacle for some creativity of your own too tips to enjoy it just boil in plenty of water the six cup requirement is a minimum drain quickly put the pasta back in the hot pot the remaining heat is just right to melt the thick cheesy sauce into the macaroni don t rinse the pasta in cold water it will make it hard for the sauce to combine well all the deluxe versions are animal rennet free annie s faq is very specific about which ones use vegetable rennet not all do but amazon isn t picking up the information i tag the really vegetarian ones animal rennet free whenever i can try blending sundried tomatoes a fresh tomato olive oil garlic pizza peppers salt freshly ground pepper and a touch of balsamic vinegar into a paste this really complements the mac and cheese and gives it a new gourmet taste that still doesn t take away from the mac and cheesiness of it tabasco chipotle sauce makes a great addition for the adventurous the smoky taste is tempered by the creaminess
positive,29/1/21,placed my order and shipping was fast the product arrived in great condition and they tasted wonderful i recommend them to other family members who also purchased them after i finish my review i m going to buy more great taste and great value

positive,6/5/21,these have got to be the best tasting gluten free cookies i have ever tasted i was just blown away by the taste and texture my husband couldn t believe it was gluten free i won t buy another brand pamelas products extreme chocolate simple bites gluten free
positive,20/4/21,these taste great very sweet and flavorful without the aftertaste of conventional candies lbs requires a bit of a financial investment but it s a great value if you re a natural candy lover this comes shipped in a plastic bag so i recommend getting a plastic tub or a using an old popcorn tin for storage gallon size or thereabouts
positive,20/4/21,i hope i don t offend but i am not a regular visitor to starbucks it is not because i don t like them but it is because i usually have my coffee at home their product is actually pretty good from the few times i have been to one of their stores this product ranks high on my list of prepackaged coffees light as i like it but very flavorful it is a nice way to start the day don t shy away from it because it has a chain restaurant brand it is actually pretty good
positive,21/4/21,loved the depth of flavor in the vanilla flavored starbucks coffee i really loved that the rich coffee could still be tasted through the flavoring the vanilla complimenting rather than overpowering tastes like a true vanilla bean not just sugary syrup i only wish that starbucks and everyone else who has flavored coffee would include nutrition facts on the side not sure why coffee doesn t see to have to but i wish they would
positive,2/5/21,i ve had many different types of starbucks coffee and there are very few i don t like i don t really care for the more mild blends but this has a nice taste to it i usually prefer a dark bold brew like french but this milder tasting coffee did not disappoint it has a smooth subtle vanilla flavor and is a nice alternative for a change the smell of vanilla fills the kitchen as it brews it s made with latin american beans and has natural ingredients bring the empty bag to starbucks when you re done and you ll get a free coffee overall the taste quality i ll give stars
positive,18/12/19,this is a product i have tried before and always have come back to great aroma flavor and value wikll buy again and again

positive,26/2/21,i do bikram yoga almost every day and this is by far the best rehydrating drink i have had it s so refreshing and one of these after class cures my thirst
positive,18/12/19,this quick bread is really easy to make even though it does require extras to be added eggs and cup of melted butter and water it cooks up fast and easy and tastes great it s a bit on the heavy side sort of like pound cake with very few poppy seeds but it s truly enjoyable i would recommend it for an occassional treat but a lot of butter is used so i wouldn t suggest daily intake of it give it a try i think you will enjoy it too
positive,19/1/20,i don t have time for much shopping and finding any sassafras drink is nearly impossible for me ordering this from amazon saves me time and and gas money it tastes good too i mix it into a mr beer bottle then carbonate it with the fizz giz soda maker in this manor i am controlling what the sweetener is and how much i use the sweetener that you use will make a big difference taste
positive,13/9/20,i was looking for all natural flavored coffee not easy to find when my college aged son brought some of this home i could not find it locally at grocery stores or starbucks locations so i m glad it s available at amazon it has a mild vanilla flavor not overwhelming like some of the artificially flavored coffees i will continue to order it
positive,10/7/20,i tried a pack randomly today at starbucks i wanted something different from the banana bread or chocolate covered graham crackers that i would otherwise buy this is some solid trail mix i highly recommend as a matter of fact i am on amazon now to buy more of it so i can let friends try
positive,24/4/21,i love this tea my wife is usually the big tea drinker in the house but after trying this in my keurig i have to say i love it i didn t purchase through amazon though because i got the same amount in a box for only elsewhere but i would recommend it to anyone
positive,28/4/21,great tea for the keurig we love it now for a good cocoa and apple cider don t get the green mountain cider
positive,12/7/21,great keurig tea pods this is not chai latte so don t expect white milky beverages this is just tea flavored with chai spices i suppose if you add hot milk you could make a decent chai latte though but i haven t tried it yet very bright flavors but not overpowering
positive,18/12/19,i really wanted to get a chocolate syrup for my sons to make chocolate milk with but hated buying hersheys because of the hfcs and other ingredients being in alaska options were zero so i ordered this off amazon in a pack to save money hoping it was good and it is we keep ours in the fridge so maybe that s why but it takes a few extra stirs to get it mixed well but the flavor is great and i can rest at ease knowing even though it s still sugary at least it is organic and natural
positive,19/1/20,this is the greatest chocolate sauce i have ever tried it beats gourmet sauces dairy sauces and any other form i have used in my life and the best part is that it is vegan and contains no nasty chemicals its only problem is that it is seriously addicting to the basic chocoholic
positive,28/4/21,i love these splenda options and i truly dislike every other sweetener on the market totally light has mixed in splenda perfectly unlike some diet sodas i will not call out by name this read tea peach is very light and refreshing and definitely makes drinking water much more enjoyable
positive,8/8/20,if you are a lover of dark chocolate marzipan and ginger this product is the sublime combination the the three
positive,22/5/21,the taste of these teas are great but i added honey to make it a little more sweet
positive,18/12/19,thankfully it is getting easier to find great tasting gluten free products we have two members of our family who can t eat gluten due to medical issues so we have to shop with that in mind many gluten free offerings taste dodgy or off but this product is an exception we had this for dinner last night and it was great we served it with shrimp and tomato sauce and everyone loved it we will definitely get this brand again next time we have a chance

positive,29/7/21,these work great in reducing nausea for my pregnant wife much better than preggie pops these also taste good i would buy again
positive,8/7/20,i love this product i have been taking wheatgrass for over a year and this is by far my favorite way to take it many of the other flavors are good too but this one mixes so easily with just milk i also add this to protein shakes for a quick and easy way to get a helping of wheatgrass i have found that it is best to first mix with a little water as it helps the wheatgrass mix better
positive,13/4/21,the stuff takes a lot of stirring to get it dissolved then drink it quickly before it starts to settle on the bottom
positive,20/2/21,i normally buy the original green superfoods but the chocolate is quite tasty i mixed it with vanilla almond milk it mixes well enough although you do still get a bit of grittiness i never tried it with just water or milk so i cannot really testify to its taste with those liquids if you like chocolate nice choice
positive,9/12/20,i enjoyed this tea just plain without honey or sugar it was tasty and refreshing it was good hot and cold very mild and much tastier than just plain green tea i would definitely recommend this
positive,1/4/21,i like this tea it s one of the better green teas i have tasted it has a smooth and subtle flavor i definitely enjoy it more than bigelow s green tea and it compares favorably to other brands as well the packaging is also very elegant i don t really have much more to say about this tea try it you might like it
positive,25/2/21,this salt works great in my grinder and is yummy i had no problems with the package all the salt was contained a great price for the amount of salt i m quite pleased
positive,18/12/19,haven t bought these from amazon but i do buy them from trader joes these cherries are very good and the best part is that there is no sugar or other sweetener added which is pretty hard to find the only reason i didn t give it stars is because some of the cherries are too dry and not that tasty but the majority of the bag is delicious
positive,19/1/20,this is item is on my regular grocery list they have a good texture and are tasty i only wish they were organic
positive,14/10/20,i ve tried many of the mtr ready to eat meals and this is one of the tastiest i will buy again
positive,10/3/21,this salt makes anything better my burgers take on a wonderful flavor i buy more than one at a time so i can share with friends the grocery does not stock this item all the time so ordering is the best way to get it i always have a bottle on hand

positive,5/6/21,i like lance products but i wasn t sure how these would be received both kids loved them they have a good texture and taste great change from chewy granola bars or cookies lance packs these with a small stiff liner so they generally survive in the lunch box without shattering definitely buying again

positive,25/7/21,this healthy request version of chunky chicken noodle is delicious it tastes the same as the regular version which isn t true of all of the varities of healthy request soup before i start to warm the soup i add a package of ramen noodles without the flavoring packet the ramen noodles absorb the chicken flavor of the liquid for a great taste and makes for an inexpensive and filling complete meal that is quick and easy to prepare with much less salt than the regular version
positive,13/7/21,no gluten free diets here but i buy it and make it fat free by substituting apple sauce for butter sweetener for sugar skim milk for buttermilk and extra egg whites for eggs i know sounds dreadful but it tastes suprisingly good the best mix i ve tried for the fat free adaptation
positive,9/7/21,i love this i have made it for cornbread and also to use as breadcrumbs for cornbread dressing it is great to have cornbread again since being diagnosed with celiac
positive,8/7/21,those who label this as weak and tasteless must be used to drinking straight espresso because this is very good tasting coffee and not weak at all although sometimes i question amazon reviews generally this is a delicious cup of coffee not to strong not too weak i tend to lean towards strong coffee personally i do have complaint though it did not seem to brew a larger cup than that of my other t discs i really doubt if that is ounces that being said i prefer this to my starbucks blend t discs starbucks is a slight bitter in comparison this is richer and a perfect middle ground between dark and light brew with terrific flavor
positive,15/7/21,if these are as nutritious as they are tasty it s a fabulous alternative to real apples these are not the fully dried apples you may have had they are partially dehydrated with a nice chewy texture they are a little tart but i m not sure if that is the apples or the sulfur dioxide it s a pleasant tart in any event hope sulfur dioxide isn t a dangerous ingredient as it s all there is except apples quality of the source fruit is excellent no core seeds skin or other bad bites i should also mention that this is a rather large serving i snack on these in my office and one bag serves as about four calorie snacks for me so it s a much better buy than it might appear
positive,6/7/21,this company has the best quality tasting baby food so i buy them all even though the packaging is kind of messy to scoop out of this flavor is my little ones favorite and it is made of healthy quality ingredients i ve tasted all of their foods and understand why my little one gobbles this right down and spits out other baby food
positive,13/8/21,i live in a major metrpolitan area and have a vacation home in florida the florida home is in a city that does not have a craft coffee shop i do not count starbucks as a craft coffee shop i puchased an espresso machine for florida and i am using the lavazza pods to make espresso and coffee drinks using espresso the results are outstanding the espresso is bold smooth and flavorful best of all little to no cleanup just toss the used pod in the garbage and you are done i buy the box of and the cost is about cents per pod
positive,5/6/21,my entire family of love this popcorn we re all big popcorn lovers and are very picky we ve converted to this brand my only complaint is that now we go through popcorn twice as fast
positive,9/7/21,my mom loved iced coffee living in sacramento hot coffee just isn t appealing when its outside but you want your coffee fix so she brewed up a whole pot of coffee using the s version of the coffee maker the percolator coffee maker the coffee wasn t that good but you could make a lot of it and then refrigerate it pour it over ice and sweeten and cream it to taste yumm starbucks makes it easier you just purchase the frappuccino mocha pop it into the refrigerator let it cool down pour it over ice and you have delicious iced coffee sweetened and creamed just how i like it what s not to like it is expensive but i suppose when you add in the cost of the half n half the coffee the sugar and the time to make it it s not that bad it s really more of an indulgence than a necessity i like to have a couple of bottles in the fridge during the summer for those times when i want something cold to drink but don t want to have a soft drink iced coffee sometimes is just what you want moderately highly recommended five stars for taste five stars for the convenience three stars for the price over all a winner
positive,17/6/21,i am an experienced cook but new to indian so this spice box was the best way for me to jump in and test the waters this was out of stock at the time i wanted it so i contacted the ajanta site directly and spoke to the owner and author of the accompanying cookbook who signed my book at their west coast ca restaurant and it was shipped promptly the next day and i rec d it two days later mind you i am on the east coast in ny i couldn t have been more pleased with the speedy delivery i was impressed with the spice box too everything was in its place and the top of the lid is mapped out in alphabetical order just like a box of chocolates so you can quickly find the specific spice you want a veritable file cabinet of spices someone else mentioned that theirs arrived all jumbled up so i have to assume that it got that way in shipping mine was pristine and thoroughly organized with a gold sticker sealing it down lovely enough to gift having all spices in front of you to see touch and smell is easier to learn about too better than just seeing illustrations in a book all in all as a beginner of indian cooking this was an economical and practical way to try almost of the necessary spices needed for any cookbook of indian cuisine i highly recommend it
positive,31/8/21,i was looking for a light cookie biscuit to have with tea in the afternoons that was low in calorie and sugar i naturally went to sprouts formerly henry s looking for this first since they have all the natural items i picked these up to try thinking that i liked the taste of honey gram plus they were percent natural and pieces has just calories all criteria s were met later that night when i had them with tea i also loved the flavor i ll be a regular buyer now

positive,5/6/21,i first tried this tea when my local grocery store had it at christmas time i went back and bought a ton of it because it immediately became my favorite tea i love the peppermint ginger and i love the fresh new bud taste of white tea over green tea leaves same plant different part this tea has it all mildly spicy and smooth yet refreshing i practically live on herbal teas and have tried lots of different ones this is my number one all time favorite
positive,9/7/21,good herbal tea seemingly air tight individual packages lock in freshness you can really taste the peppermint oil but not in an overbearing way i am happy
positive,19/6/21,we enjoy the flavor of this tea we use it for hot tea and ice tea using a regular teabag and this pumpkin spice tea mix good ice tea it is good for the holiday season
positive,5/9/21,my husband and i are coffee and tea freaks we ll try just about anything once i really like this tea even if it s not christmas very smooth the mint finish is very nice the ginger note is subdued and not overpowering as i thought it might be well worth trying at least once
positive,10/10/21,very nice mild taste doesn t have any burned or bitter taste like most of dark roasts
positive,29/9/21,i normally drink half caff and am very pleased with it but after trying a sample of the tully s french roast decaf that came in a variety pack i was truly amazed at the flavor i anticipated it being bland not much taste but i was sooo wrong the flavor is so rich and robust that a couple times i checked the box to confirm it was actually decaffinated although i will continue to drink the half caf this product has taken the spot on my coffee list
positive,11/9/21,got for my fiance and she loves the taste and the half calf is much easier for her to handle than a full caff and it doesn t make her fall back to sleep like the decaf does before switching to half caff she was drinking dark magic so if you want so switch to half caff from that this might be a good one to try
positive,5/6/21,this coffee tastes so good we have completely given up going out for coffee love the ease of the product and amazons fast shipping with prime
positive,9/7/21,this is going to be a staple in my house from now on good flavor less jitters makes a great anytime coffee decaf can be so uninspiring i wish they would make flavored half caf are you listening green mountain
positive,26/8/21,when we got our keurig coffee maker i was excited to try new coffees most are way too strong for me i do like flavor but way too often the k cups are more bold than i like this caramel drizzle has just the right combination of coffee and caramel and makes for a nice rich but smooth cup of coffee
positive,26/7/21,this rice blend is very tasty and has nice chewy bits in it from the addition of the barley and rye berries i greatly enjoy it
positive,11/9/21,i ve been trying with limited amounts of success to eat vegan and low gi amys soups are excellent for this they make it very easy to lose weight one limiting factor is fat cravings eating vegan it s actually hard to get enough fat this is a long way of saying this soup tastes great i can tell it s oily and i love that about it i need fat in my diet or i ll lose my mind and eat a whole pizza low fat diets are a travesty anyway creating a market for high sugar high gi products labeled as healthy so this soup brings oil and mushrooms and a very good flavor i ve had about a dozen types of amys soups and this is at the top with golden lentil no chicken noodle and trader joes lentil vegetable made by amys
positive,11/9/21,i would have given this a star but the container was not completely sealed i took off the cap and the seal was partially lifted up i have used it several times and the flavor is great

positive,28/7/20,i love this butter it s better than regular butter and makes eggs or anything else taste great plus it s organic with higher levels of conjugated linoleic acid cla a must in every home i think
positive,10/11/19,the package doesn t lie these are big bars they are also very dense and as a result are very filling they re very chewy so if you ve got jaw problems you might want to skip these that s the only thing i didn t like about them that being said they have a great peanut flavor and i enjoyed the layer of peanut butter on the bottom i think the peanut butter makes the bar overall a very tasty snack and a nice large bar
positive,1/3/20,i m not sure that these bars are really all that different from a candy bar they re pretty sweet and not exactly low calorie however they are quite tasty
positive,3/8/19,dark chocolate cookies taste great i have just tried the peanut butter and those are good too
positive,6/2/21,these are quite good tasting even though you have to buy several boxes rather than just one at a time the individual boxes are manageable enough for use over a period of time it would be nice as with most things if they were a bit less expensive and also didn t have to be bought in bulk but overall they re very good especially compared to some other organic offerings
positive,24/2/21,these cookies are really good you wouldn t even know they are gluten free if you didn t read the package my only complaint is the size is a little small for the money althogh the individual packages are really nice to help with portion control
positive,13/5/21,taste exactly like what you can get from store in asia beats all the us made products in the taste department also great for making bread not sure why not more us grocery stores carry them
positive,1/3/20,i wasn t sure that we would be able to find a powdered milk that my family would like but this is it we d gladly use this product on a regular basis if the price was a little lower powdered whole milk doesn t have as long of a shelf life as non fat so this should be taken into consideration for long term food storage
positive,28/7/20,tastes great and so easy to make in the k cup machine little more then i like to spend on kcups but well worth it
positive,26/3/21,i just bought these fiber one bars a couple hours ago and i m completely satisfied with the taste actually i was surprised it tasted so good i will definitely purchase more in the future the only down side is that it has to many carbs but taking one a day for those times where you need something sweet is perfect
positive,29/8/19,i m glad i read the reviews saying to only use a few drops in a beverage too many drops and it quickly goes from delicious to strange and bitter the directions on the bottle say drops but i find or is perfect in a oz drink or a cup of yogurt

positive,14/7/21,obviously opinions vary on this but i eat enjoy life granola daily i don t understand the comments about it not being crunchy unless perhaps people have had outdated bags i appreciate enjoy life being dairy soy and corn free as well as gluten free as i can t have any of these the cranapple flavor is the best i mix it with erehwon gluten free brown rice cereal and use vanilla rice milk since opinions differ so on this product if you re on a gluten free diet you should try it

positive,7/3/20,i am using rice pasta because a family member is gluten intolerant this pasta tastes so good that everyone in the household eats it
positive,4/8/20,first you can either soak or spray this product if you re lazy like i am you can put it in a spray bottle spray your produce in a colander in the sink and rinse a bit later i ve never had it affect the taste or appearance of food in any way with the exception of when it starts to clean the wax from apples the wax turns whiter starts to chip off when i ve used the soak method i ve seen the dirty water after so i do feel like this does a nice cleaning job i love this stuff and many grocery chains don t carry it reliably so it s great that amazon has it
positive,26/12/19,these taste great and exactly like their ingredients also they do not have too much sugar the only thing that i would watch out for is the fat content since each little bar have gms of fat
positive,28/3/21,i want to begin by saying that i m no cacao expert this is the first time i ve tried it i wanted to try it for three reasons honestly a trusted friend suggested it i m always looking for healthy snacks to fill my day i m on the go constantly cacao s supposed health benefits i m not saying it does or does not have them just alluding to the fact that i m no health nutritional expert so here s what i think these are going to be an acquired taste like beer actually they very much remind me of a red wine a burgundy maybe the bag even smells like wine when you open it up they are very tiny pieces they are very crunchy if you have teeth that are very sensitive i d think twice about getting these upon tasting them on the front of the palate it tasted very much like a red wine then slightly bitter and moving to the back of the palate it tasted very earthy and you got the flavor of cocoa powder then swallow you are going to want something to rinse it down it s a little grainy at that point i like the texture and i like the taste but then again i like wine i have mixed it into yogurt and i find it rather good you get less of the wine bitter flavors and more of the earthy and traditional cocoa powder flavors i use honey flavored greek yogurt i also eat them plain as little nibbles they don t bother me that way either a little wake me up if the flavor really offends you but you want the health benefits you can order organic sugar cacao nibs do an internet search they are tossed with organic cane syrup i will try those for a treat soon that s all i got cheers

positive,8/9/20,this macaroni and cheese is the only kind that both the adults and the kids in our family enjoy it has a slightly sharp cheddar flavor that makes it taste so much better than the processed cheese food types our whole family swears by annie s homegrown deluxe shells real aged wisconsin cheddar and it is much cheaper buying them here than one at a time at the grocery store

positive,2/11/18,i m trying to get more whole grains in my diet and try as i might i detest whole grain bread these crackers are a wonderful substitute crisp and pretty tasty as well i love them with cheese the only reason i knocked off a star is once you unwrap the package you really need to put the whole thing in a ziplock bag there s no way to reseal so they stay fresh

positive,24/1/19,my husband loves this tea out of all of the slimming teas he has tried this is my favorite a good minty and refreshing taste other slimming teas are very licoricey or bitter this one is nice i m not sure how much it slims or suppresses appetite as he usually drinks it after he eats i ve told him a million times it s supposed to be the other way around however we like drinking it nonetheless best price we ve found is the bulk pack on amazon
positive,27/2/19,it is very hard finding this item in the stores i use it on meats dips and even gravy it has a great blend of garlic and herbs i even gave my daughter some of the boxes now she is hooked
positive,19/4/20,this chocolate is very smooth rich and full bodied in flavor it makes great truffles cookies or whatever it s used for melts evenly and can be used for hot chocolate drinks too

positive,7/8/19,first great value for this sport drink and second the tropical fruit flavor is good even better cold i used it to train for a marathon and i will continue to use it i always feel great and keeps me hydrated on those long runs seems to give me the energy and hydration i need also i switched it from frs which is also good but the citros powder on the frs seemed to stay longer on your mouth not this one mixes very well too fast with no lumps
positive,9/3/18,the taste is great tropical punch you have to dilute from the measurements they gave you or its way to strong only knock is that if its not drunk immediately it collects at the bottom
positive,18/5/18,i use about and scoops in my oz bottle and it tastes great it allows me to drink more than i would plain water which is the best way to stay hydrated so far no complaints
positive,27/1/19,i have been drinking the original cheribundi for a bit now but it was a tad expensive so i checked out amazon and they had it for a bit less i discovered they have additional flavors like the ginger cherry cherries help calm inflammation which is why i picked it up the first time i have a bottle about every other day and use it to flavor my homemade kombucha great item
positive,10/11/19,i don t eat chips often but when i do these are some of my favorites they have all the flavor and texture of traditional tortilla chips but it is the subtle lime flavoring that makes them special the lime flavoring appears to be a seasoning that has been sprinkled on some chips have minimal flavor and i find myself looking for those with the most still none of them have quite enough for my tastes i wish that these chips had more than just a hint of lime
positive,8/11/19,i bought this for a trial run with my new meat grinder and it was excellent it took a total of two days for shipping and the price was great too
positive,25/10/21,this is a great tasting healthy drink but for some reason mine did not come with straws
positive,28/9/18,i bought this as an impulse buy today i m really trying to cut out soda from my diet i m a pepsi junkie i ll admit it and i have the waistline to prove it so i brought my water bottle and honestly i hate water so i shot three squirts of this into a oz bottle and it s good tastes good mixes well it is a tad pricey but it s either that or go back to my pepsi i like it recommended
positive,29/7/19,buying a latte from a coffee shop or fast food place can be expensive and contain many calories i was surprised to see that hill bros has brought out an instant mix called skinny latte with has grams of fat and only calories it takes tbsp for every fl oz of boiling water and it taste great
positive,18/5/18,excellent fine ground coffee that easily bests more well known brands it is aromatic and tasty without bitterness for the price currently about for oz can on an amazon subscription you can t beat it
positive,26/3/20,it s a great product i got some while i was in england and brought some home to share with my family my children ate the entire box at no time very tasty crunchy too bad it s so expensive to buy it here in the you s
positive,24/2/20,since visiting hawaii i have fallen in love with passion fruit juice this flavor is hard to find even in california often other tropical flavors are mixed in this tastes exactly like i expected it too it is very concentrated i am happy with about an ounce in a ounce bottle i add water ice and splenda to taste the directions say to mix the ounce bottle with more bottles of water makes over a gallon as far as i can tell it is unsweetened it does contain some preservatives including cirtic acid sodium bezoate and metabisulphite this comes from brazil great product i use it for juice to flavor greek yogurt and to add to a white or yellow cake for a tropical flavor you can also make a great pie follow your favorite lemon chiffon recipe and use this instead of the lemon juice i will be buying more i bought bottles same shipping cost as one bottle
positive,3/5/19,this true bar is very tasty and feeling and a great pick me up between meals the flavors are great and and it doesn t leave you dry in the mouth like some bars do
positive,27/3/20,the simply bars are the best tasting gluten free dairy soy free bars that i have tried to date you won t be disappointed
positive,31/12/20,i had purchased some extract beans from another company and was looking forward to trying the higher grade beans when i opened the package which arrived promptly i was not blown away by a heavenly aroma of vanilla and at first was dissapointed the beans however were are moist and plump and when i made a custard with them the flavor was rich and heavenly i put the beans into a couple zip lock bags and put them away and a couple days i started smelling this amazing smell like really nice pipe tobacco it of course was the beans i bought a nice airtight container for them these are fantastic and far far better than anything i ve ever gotten from the grocery store i will be buying these again and again
positive,13/1/20,these are better than regular pretzels they are light and crunchy with a buttery taste i am so glad to have found these they restored hope that i can have good food without the aftermath that typically comes with eating my mother who has no problem with gluten tried them and liked them she even packed up some to take with her after tasting them she was surprised because she thought they were going to be salty like normal pretzels
positive,21/9/20,i was shocked after tasting these to find that i like these better than other pretzels that are not gf which is great due to having to switch to gf diet this makes a wonderful snack and the price is not that bad even in the store meijer s by me and whole foods both carry
positive,2/12/20,an excellent product that holds up well not soggy and very tasty these rice noodles are especially wonderful in soup on the box there is a terrific recipe i immediately tried my husband and i loved it
positive,20/11/19,the banana flavor lean body has a great taste it does not have the watered down nutri sweet taste to it either i have been very satisfied with the lean body ready to go shakes so far although i have not yet tried all the flavors my husband usually drinks the pure protien ready to go shakes and he recently got a hold of mine and now he wants me to buy the lean body ones for him because they taste so much better i told him he cannot because they are more expensive then his but i do not think he s going to let me get away with it
positive,2/12/20,i bought blue sky organic black cherry pop at a local health store along with their orange while i found the orange to taste a bit flat and un orange the black cherry was outstanding just the right amount of sweet not over powering at all i do not like my drinks to taste like they are full of high fructose corn syrup the cane juice gives it the taste it needs and a healthful reprieve from hfc the cherry flavor was decently bold and very refreshing i love that amazon has this pop for sale and as an option for repete orders because i can t afford to buy it from the health store too often
positive,11/12/19,i am not a coffee drinker but tea is what wakes me up in the morning this is a great black tea with a wonderful flavor i french press it to bring out the flavor this loose leaf tea is perfect for this i have never enjoyed a cup of tea more than this one
positive,20/11/19,all of the mrs dash marinates are wonderful they re quick and delicious we initially tried them for their health benefits but the flavor is why we continue to buy them i highly recommend every flavor
positive,28/6/20,these were excellent for the price the gummies were soft and fresh and tasted great i m looking forward to purchasing them again in the near future
positive,8/8/20,i have purchased two of these products and the only reason my review is stars instead of is because on my second shipment the cap was loose on one of the bottles and it ended up pouring all over the other bottles in the carton i was wondering why all my bottles were sticky until i hit the one that was almost completely empty otherwise great drink
positive,14/7/21,everyone in my house loves these cookies even my sister who is not into healthy foods
positive,2/12/20,my wife and i love to cook this product is excellent we have used it as directed and the results were great pulled pork we also have added our own spin by adding other spices and herbs or a little wine mccormick s bbq pulled pork has never let us down whether used as directed or adding a few of our favorite flavors we have always had mouth watering exceptional pulled pork if you have not tried this product please do yourself a favor and give it a try i believe you will be extremely satisfied with the results our most difficult problem is waiting for the slow cooker to finish blending the flavors but it is worth every minute we wait just thinking how darn good dinner is going to be al schweiger
positive,20/11/19,the basis of my diet is using the zesty italian with little or no oil and i still get that great taste
positive,1/3/21,exactly how i expected but more gel than paste actually no paste at all just gel like vanilla bean extract but without the alcohol bit great
positive,5/5/21,knowing that i like ramen my sister suggested that i give these a try i m on my second order as i really enjoy the flavor and texture the noddle s in this yakisoba have a different flavor and texture then what i am use to in the ramen packets that i normally eat but are very tasty as with most of these type products it is easy to prepare and the flavor can be adjusted to your taste by the amount of seasoning used i reason for only stars has to do with the container that is used after it is cooked in the microwave and the lid is peeled off there is a sticky adhesive left around lip not a problem if you are going pour the contents into a bowl but kind of gets in the way when eating directly from the container
positive,2/12/20,i already loved raisin bran but this is even better i love the almonds and there are crunch bits that stay that way through the whole bowl the flavor is the same raisin bran that i love with a little cinnamon flavor boost and extra crunch i think it is awesome
positive,20/11/19,i like the original raisin bran and it was a staple in our home growing up but i think i really like this much better when eating the original raisin bran i actually added a little extra sugar not sure why exactly but i always felt that it needed it no extra sugar needed with this new cinnamon almond raisin bran it has the right amount of sweetness crunch almonds and cinnamon i was afraid the cinnamon would be overpowering but it is a perfect balance not sure if the flakes turn soggy like the orginal flakes because i keep eating it too fast to find out my six year old was eating it straight from the box last night and he said it was delicious i would definitely purchase this cereal again
positive,9/10/21,i like this a lot as a topping on my popcorn instead of butter it s very good and has kept well in the refrigerator after several months i will order more update i bought a second batch i didn t have room in my fridge so i ve been leaving it in the pantry i ve had it a few months now and it still tastes great
positive,6/3/21,great substitute for soda and taste great dissolves completely with no added residue i will try other flavors from this manufactures
positive,12/2/21,this is a great tasting coffee it gets my day started off on the right foot
positive,2/12/20,i am a real coffee lover and am hooked on senseo coffee my regular coffee pot is gathering dust in the corner of my kitchen i recently tried sumatra and just fell in love with it if you like the real taste of coffee you ll love it as much as i do highly recommend this
positive,17/3/20,the packaging isn t too sophisticated and as another review mentioned it s more liquid than other kinds of tahini but it really tastes great this how i ve used it a goya package of dry chickpeas dipped in water for hours then boiled for hours about ounce tahini half a cup water lemon juice salt garlic blend everything until smooth
positive,20/10/21,this stuff tastes great i wasn t expecting much when i mixed it with my orange juice but i was wrong i can t claim any miracles in the health department but i haven t had any recent cholesterol checks either it makes a delicious smoothie and i will continue to use it because i read and believe the studies on acai
positive,21/7/20,this was the first product from amy s that i tried and i like it it doesn t taste like regular chili but i think that it has a good taste to it the sodium content is quite high though so check that out if your watching your sodium intake i think that it s a little too expensive but i ll probably buy it again if it goes on sale
positive,22/2/21,this coffee has a wonderful flavor and provides the convenience of a one cup brew instead of a pot you may also purchases flavors and it s as good as the cup you get at one of the coffee chains the automatic refill program offered is an excellent and convenient way to make sure you never run out
positive,8/6/21,almost the best home brewed coffee i have ever had and the price is great much less expensive than the grocery store i highly reccomend it if your into coffee
positive,2/12/20,got this for my sister and had a bite as some one who normally eats gummies i got to say i thought it tasted better then the normal sized bears also i do not recommend eating it in one sitting
positive,20/11/19,love these they taste so good and are good for you i love giving my son something that is not full of un natural sugars
positive,25/1/21,i have been drinking powdered cocoa for nearly years i consider myself pretty familiar with the powdered add water type cocoas and most of them taste like sand they are gritty and are either too sweet or far too bitter or have no real flavor at all and stay in a thick lump at the bottom of the mug no matter how much you stir with a spoon in nearly years i have only found two brands of cocoa that did not taste like gritty sludge e g swiss miss carnation nestle s one powdered cocoa is from the lds church and it s almost impossible to get in kentucky the distribution center is in indianapolis and none of the wards here seem to have anyone who holds the calling of preparation specialist therefore no one goes to indy very often the second great cocoa was made by cold stone creamery it was sold through walmart and was as smooth as the church cocoa unfortunately walmart no longer stocks it i m not sure it s even manufactured any more yesterday i ran across stevens cocoa it was on the shelf for that s right a measly buck so i decided to try it i knew that if i didn t like it i could take it to work and give it away i m in love this stuff is equally as good as the cocoa from the lds church and cold stone creamery one sip and i was hooked it dissolves well it s not overly sweet it has a nice mild flavor and it s just downright good i top it with redi whip for fun but it doesn t need it it s good without any help i m headed back to stock up on more cans if it disappears from the shelves in a couple of weeks it s nice to know i can get it from amazon i never thought i d fall in love with a product enough to buy it from amazon when the supply dried up on the shelves but i m making an exception for this cocoa it s worth it
positive,1/7/21,like the chocolate hard to find the other flavor don t know why but no one carries it
positive,30/9/20,needless to say these cookies didn t last long once they were opened they reminded my wife of the tagalongs the girl scouts used to sell very smooth fudge coating and that oh so lovely oreo crunch i could eat these all day viva la oreo
positive,15/3/20,i love oreos especially these new fudge ones they re now my favorite i ve tried both the mint and the peanut butter versions now and while the peanut butter are good the mint is still my favorite that being said these aren t bad at all i still very much enjoyed them my two kids year old boy and year old girl both loved them as well whenever they could they were begging for these cookies in my mind that s a good sign if you ve got a kid begging for these you ve got a pretty good product my one disappointment is that it s not the full cookie it s just half of it maybe they ve done that to cut costs but as i recall there was a similar oreo product at one time that offered the full cookie either way still worth it and definitely a cookie i d recommend
positive,6/7/21,those familiar with regular oreos and really who isn t won t find anything too terribly unfamiliar with these peanut butter oreo fudge cremes they consist of a single wafer which is topped with a layer of peanut butter creme then enrobed in a fudge coating the wafer is thin and nicely crispy the creme is purportedly peanut butter flavored but to be honest i was unable to pick up any of that it was still tasty just not as peanut butter y as i d hoped the fudge coating was not too thin not too thick just nicely adding a hint of creamy chocolate goodness what else can really be said about an oreo although i might wish that the peanut butter flavor was more intense i was still quite happy to nibble on them i certainly wouldn t mind doing so again
positive,29/6/21,these pickles are amazing once you have tried this unremarkable flavor you won t go back to those retail manufactured brand of pickles nothing comes close to these pickles definitely will be a repeat customer
positive,29/6/21,medium light roast you can really smell and enjoy the aroma of high quality arabica if you are a fan of medium light roast you will enjoy this coffee smooth no burning flavor
positive,26/7/21,small just right for a little something sweet ginger flavor is good it comes on gradually until it is almost intense a bargain
positive,25/10/21,these colors are so true to life and vibrant the drip drop out of the bottle makes it so easy to duplicate the exact same color again the food color doesn t change the taste or texture of any food i had no problems with shipping and it was super fast
positive,29/6/21,i ordered three bags of these with a past order all i can say is yum i did not compare prices too much but this product tasted better and fresher than any i have found in local markets
positive,5/7/21,i have nasty food allergies to wheat dairy eggs corn peanuts and about dozen other foods so when i find something i can actually eat i have a tendency to buy a case simply put these are great they have a wonderful soft texture with a mildly sweet but not too sweet flavor for anyone with allergies or intolerances like myself they re a real lifesaver they re satisfying nicely packaged and very fresh tasting i ll be buying more
positive,17/9/21,these are the best gummi bears available i got hooked on them when i was in germany i was so happy to see i could get them through amazon
positive,18/8/21,we searched everywhere to find this jerky it is the best on the market and they ship very quickly we had it in less than days we have already reordered it
positive,31/7/21,when i first bought this product i thought instant cornmeal it csnnot be that tasty wow i cud not believe it it tasted like the real thing very easy to travel around with and a small flask of hot water very filling
positive,18/10/21,very tasty and delicious i like this tea very much it has a very good flavour and my whole family likes when i serve them a cup of tea
positive,29/6/21,i had used these smaller jars of honey while on a trip in france a few years ago they were in the hotels with the breakfasts i don t use honey very often and the larger jars i purchase at the grocery store end up going to waste these little jars are perfect for me the flavor is not too intense and the size is perfect for my use plus they bring back memories of a wonderful trip i took to a country where i grew up
positive,16/9/21,these are very good i can t say which is my favorite flavor but i m leaning towards the key lime when i read the review and description i figured they d be crispy but they are normal shortbread with little chips or snaps you might say of flavor i love the packaging of the four flavors as well i will be reordering
positive,24/8/21,emerald cove organic toasted nori sheets ever since i found the emerald toasted nori i put it everywhere i make sushi with brown rice decorate fish dishes with shredded nori and even fish burritos it has a pleasant fishy taste that i like each sheet has only calories and each bag contain a packet of moisture absorbing powder to protect the nori from dampness also on the back of the bag there is a pledge of organic purity all ingredients certified organic no ingredients have been irradiated i am glad about that because that was my very first concern there is a nice and simple sushi recipe on the back as well and emerald cove nori has no sodium even my cat likes it product of china certified kosher i like that thank you
positive,24/6/21,these things are better than steak filet mignon it was well worth the purchase of this package it saves you a couple bucks versus buying them in the store go ahead splurge yourself and get some
positive,27/9/21,i love it going to be on my shopping list from now on great as a snack do not need milk but great that way too
positive,29/6/21,ribs were very tasty and tender and i will definitely buy them again just had to put them in aluminum foil with a little water and heat so easy to fix
positive,5/8/21,this product is the best raw honey growing up my dad had bee hives in south louisiana and this is exactly how i remember the taste of raw honey i highly recommend this product
positive,29/6/21,i did not know i was a fan of soy milk it taste great and i have one in the morning instead of cow s milk it is also gluten free for all the celiac s out there no casein or lactose as well i have already recommended this to friends
positive,31/7/21,we have artifical sweetners for years i tried this sweetner now we only use this the other sweetner do not taste as good
positive,11/9/21,hard to beat the flavor of this stuff its fresh and clean still not going to blow your head off maybe melinda needs to come out with a xxxxxxxxxxxtra hot version of this stuff but you ll still have a hard time finding any other habanero sauce that tastes better on fish pork or chicken still not as universal as tabasco habanero but a great complement to veggies and other light dishes and when you go to firehouse for a sub you can try this on your smoked turkey and you will be pleasantly amazed at the effect great stuff a staple for any decent collection by the way if you like the flavor of this stuff and still crave more heat check out iguana radioactive atomic sauce its got the same basic ingredients as melinda s the same consistency but is about x up the heat scale from this relatively weak xxxx sauce scovies
positive,12/8/21,unusual and very tasty as you might expect they taste like okra i wish they were a little less expensive but i don t know of any alternative
positive,31/7/20,this product sells for at trader joes for only one bag here you get bags for and since amazon ships it the shipping is so fast all you need to add is cinnamon and brown sugar and you are good to go i have eaten this for everymeal and promise you it is great also it is very very filling i have missed oatmeal since being diagnosed with celiac s and am so grateful i found this prodcut thank you amazon for making this much more affordable i will continue ordering it from you
positive,13/6/20,lately i ve been trying about or more sauces to find just the right one that balances flavor and burn but to put this into perspective i really go for the insanely hot so this may need to be measured by that this sauce is not really that hot but the taste is awesome it definately has heat but doesn t really have much burn in short if you want something that shames commercial pizza place hot wings in both heat and taste this is a great choice in fact i m browsing the internet to see about ordering a case for those days when i don t want my food to have the last highly pronounced word if you follow my meaning
positive,31/7/20,when i got my miniature labradoodle puppy the breeder recommended getting one of these i am so glad i did this will entertain your dog for hours the inserts are a little expensive but well worth the price for the amount of time your dog will enjoy this product so far she has not been able to damage the ball itself after months for me that means it should last about two years or more before i have to replace it for a puppy dog toy that is everlasting i love it and highly recommend it just a note my dog is small and the medium size ball seems perfect
positive,13/6/20,stevia is a safe natural sugar substitute that has been used for thousands of years i have used it safely myself for years now is my favorite brand because there is no bitter aftertaste use it in coffee tea yogurt milk cereal puddings fruit dips etc it is truly an amazing produce that keeps my life sweet and not fat
positive,26/9/20,if you are looking for a fantastic glass of iced tea without the fuss this product is for you just add water your favorite sweetner and enjoy
positive,17/10/20,i am completely hooked on lipton s glass size cold brew tea bags the small tea bags can stay in your glass of tea all day and never leak leaves like the big tea bags thank you lipton
positive,14/12/20,we like to make smoothies in our home throw a little yogurt some milk some ice and lots of fruit into a blender and yummmmm but sometimes we are out of yogurt or milk or even fruit or sometimes we want a fruit that isn t in season that is where this smoothie mix comes in you put this smoothie mix into a blender with some ice and you have a smoothie w e have tried the peach flavor and the wild berry flavor out of the two we prefer this peach it has a great flavor and mixes up well in addition to using this for smoothies we also use this when we make ice cream this is a great product that will save you time on those mornings when you are rushed and just need something fast for breakfast or a snack enjoy
positive,29/5/20,i love mrs may s these aren t my favorites of what they make but they are tasty and handy to have around the cashews or the black sesame seeds are the five star snacks
positive,4/8/20,my year old cat wasn t eating had to have a tooth pulled and was generally miserable he s always been thin and a picky eater after the tooth was pulled he was interested in food but wouldn t eat i had to squirt it in his mouth a few times before he got the idea i wasn t going to give up once he started drinking it he loved it and began asking for it his coat is thicker and doesn t fall out as much he s put on weight and even if he s having a sick day from hair balls he can drink this without throwing up the rest of the day he s so much happier and plays more now even if there s a day when he isn t interested in food i don t worry as much because he s so much healthier now thank you
positive,31/7/20,easy to make without a bread maker and very tasty it s good with everything but we especially like it for breakfast toasted with butter and honey very good value
positive,13/6/20,i loved this bread very tasty with a good texture and taste i tried making something similar from scratch and it didn t turn out anything like this bread slices great warm or cold i bake for my boss and her family and they all voted a resounding yes we like this when i brought her in a loaf freezes well and toasts up great either plain or with butter or cream cheese my boss ate hers with spaghetti after lightly toasting she said it was outstanding and wanted more am i surprised no would highly recommend if you want a good italian style bread i made mine in my horizonetal wolfgang puck breadmaker and used a crisp or dark crust setting i tried all other settings light and medium and the bread came out great with a little different texture but still great nonetheless
positive,21/11/20,i make bread all the time always look for variety this bread is tasty delicious i have a two loaf bread machine and my husband kids favorite is this one
positive,25/5/21,we want you to know that we are very pleased with the quality of service your company provides we sincerely appreciate your responsiveness and the way you conduct business we have recommended your company to others because of our satisfaction with your service product we look forward to doing business with you for years to come
positive,25/5/21,received boxes box was shy one squeeze pack daughter was extremely angry when she did inventory otherwise she s happy will be more cautious reactive if it happens again
positive,20/1/21,great refreshing nonperishable treat keep it under my desk at work and enjoy an apple whenever i have a craving
positive,15/1/21,product is as advertised my grandkids love them and i do too great for on the go b brothers all natural fuji apple crisps ounce bags pack of
positive,8/2/21,i love this chili i ve seen amy s products in the supermarket and have been really tempted to purchase any of their products i ve had other meatless products that were awful but this was entirely different experience i ts spicy but still holds it flavor and you would never know it s meatless i will definitely order this again
positive,10/2/21,i like these because they re not too sweet but of course that also means you can just keep eating and eating them without realizing how many you ve plowed your way through so be careful a three cookie serving contains calories and grams of fat lots of fruit and the citrus flavor really comes through and as they re thin and crisp they re the perfect accompaniment to a cup of tea because they don t immediately go soggy i m not usually a big cookie person but i ll probably be getting these again
positive,9/10/20,this have been a huge hit with the whole family they remind me of a tea cracker more than a cookie or anything newton they aren t overly sweet and have a subtle orange and cranberry flavor the cranberries can be a bit chewy but add to the overall texture of the cookies they also travel well and are great cookies for lunch boxes and toddlers
positive,31/7/20,these are a pretty healthy tasty snack they are more like a cracker with a bit of dried fruit baked into the product my kids loved them
positive,13/6/20,what i liked about this product was first the way it was packaged inside there are several rows of thin cookies in a plastic tray you can grab to your heart s content when eaten the cookie and the bits of fruit blend and make a great taste the only qualm is the package wire on the top it is not really easy to close and that may need to be redesigned but the product itself is tasty and i can t get enough of the bits of fruit what a good idea
positive,5/12/20,i requested two types of chips ahoy s newest cookies these were tasty and the others were not so don t interpret this review as relevant to similar cookies just these alone the cookies tasty chocolatey and don t have an overpowering processed aftertaste one finds with many foods of this type they are very sweet but you can tell you re eating a chocolate cookie in moderation i had two at most at a time it s decent and easy snack they are very chewy almost a dough consistency but the cookie doesn t fall apart easily i think the frosting center helps the cookie s structure very good with a cup of black coffee
positive,1/11/20,we all enjoyed these very chocolatey cookies they have a nice chewy texture and gooey center which complement each other well they may not be homemade but they were still great with a glass of milk
positive,21/7/20,the mtr bisi bela bath is authentic and tasty i highly recommend it you can have this with pappad or some yoghurt on the side and it makes a complete meal
positive,23/1/21,i honestly think it makes my regular recipes taste better then when i make them with table salt about half as salty as table salt so the lb bag was a must for me reasonable price great way to lead a little bit healthier lifestyle you re going to eat salt anyway so why not get the extra minerals and a great taste
positive,31/7/20,good flavor you can use less than the directions suggest and get the same flavor without the thickness of syrup good stuff though
positive,13/6/20,we have been using enjoy life products for awhile due to life threatening food allergies during a walk for faan they gave out samples of this cookie my child loved it and wanted more at the time they did not carry it in the stores so i found it online it was a great purchase it came when expected and the cookies disappeared fast i will be ordering more soon
positive,1/12/20,i ve been using this liquid sucralose for about months on a daily basis and i couldn t be happier if you are on a low carb diet remember you are adding carbs to your coffee with every packet you open from the anti caking agents but you don t have to be on a special eating regimen to appreciate this because it is so cost effective one oz bottle lasts me about months for dollars it is easy to over sweeten if you aren t careful especially when the bottle is full but you get used to that
positive,30/1/21,best big train flavor out there and price is way cheaper than finding these packets locally at a coffee shop
positive,1/1/21,loved the flavor of strawberry and rhubarb texture perfect for me definitely would order again a treat for me
positive,11/1/21,this is a great dish i thoroughly enjoy it every time i eat it so easy to prepare
positive,31/7/20,i made these brownies for a function i was attending and didn t mention they were gluten free i made two batches and they all went i m not too crazy over most gf items but this is one of the best the price on amazon is much less then the price in supermarkets
positive,13/6/20,this is the best popcorn ever i wish all stores sold it but so far i have found it only on amazon and some wal mart stores i would rather buy it from amazon of course it tastes great and is also just the right amount to watch a movie at home or to share with a partner
positive,5/5/21,but as far as it helping me produce more milk not sure it helped much tastes good though

positive,18/6/21,i received one pack of vanilla blueberry clusters with flax seeds through amazon vine and it made a great breakfast for me very tasty and the flax seeds gave it some texture as well my only regret is that i didn t get more it was so delicious that i ate it all in one serving i ll probably be ordered some more soon
positive,7/7/21,this whole grain is very tasty the clusters are small enough you can toss it into yogurt or eat as a cereal but they are also large enough you can eat them as a snack lightly sweet full of texture and cholesterol free these blueberry vanilla clusters are very healthy with a high source of fiber mg of omega fatty acids and g of whole grain you can feel good about eating this it s very economical and convenient i look forward to trying other flavors

positive,7/7/21,this is the best tasting health drink i have had i wanted something with resveratrol but did not want to have to take a pill this tastes like grape gatorade almost really good price wise it is pricey but i am only drinking one a day and it is no more expensive than some people s starbucks coffee in the morning
positive,30/6/21,my wife and i both love these looking to possibly make a bulk purchase now one caution since you are paying a premium for organic raw sprouted foods made in a family business they go quickly eat them slowly and savor the taste i also recommend goraw s other products as well i like their pumpkin seed based product a lot
positive,1/7/21,this is first time trying ambrosia pure honey from colorado s w slope and my first implosion is great for the taste and price however i feel the honey is not really pure since the consistency is not as i expected when i purchased it overall i like the taste and the kids do too
positive,24/8/21,these little things are delicious i didn t expect much my wife bought them apparently and they were just sitting on the kitchen table she must not have told me about them because she figured i d eat them all if that s the case she s probably right these things definitely exceeded all my expectations and were good enough for me to immediately come here and right a review they do seem pretty pricey here though but i m not sure what they run in the stores since i didn t buy them personally
positive,21/7/21,these biscuits are very good and my second favorite to the blueberry these biscuits are not filling enough alone for breakfast so i eat them as a sweet snack i wish the calories were lower but that doesn t deter me from buying they are a winner

positive,11/7/21,i had my first taste of this coffee at the cafe monde in new orleans of course with their hand made donuts beneigns the coffee is very strong when you brew it use much less than you would normally use than regular coffee the chicory adds a distinct flavor but also smoothes it out its famous for a good reason but remember to use less when brewing john from buffalo

positive,6/7/21,i found this fajita sauce and the related chimichurri sauce at a local global foods mart but after using the bottles up my wife recycled them and i had forgotten the brand name so i spent the next months looking for them ever time we went grocery shopping apparently the local mart stopped carrying them needless to say i bought lots of chimichurri sauce brands most of which were not nearly as delicious as i recalled this brand to be until on a whim i looked up chimichurri here on amazon needless to say as soon as i saw the world harbors label i recognized the brand again anyway whenever i make burritos or tacos i add either the chimichurri or fajita sauce and my family guests now think i should go into the restaurant business p

positive,6/3/21,i purchased the cafe mocha when amazon was having a sale on the pack of otherwise the regular price is much to expensive and not worth it the mocha was good but a bit too sweet for my taste so i mixed it with a small espresso shot k cup of regular coffee which made it taste like a mocha from starbucks you can also get the same taste if you use a k cup of hot chocolate and combine it with a k cup of regular or decaf coffee and it will still be less costly than the cafe escapes at regular price all in all i m happy with the product and would continue to buy if only the price was better
positive,7/1/21,we use this ketchup all the time at our house in order to cut down on sugar it tastes just like the regular ketchup to us the bottle with the wide head is handy because you can easily store it upside down that makes it easier to squirt out the remaining ketchup

positive,29/3/21,i got the sour apple version of the clif kid twisted fruit and even though i m not a kid exactly i still take these to work for lunch they do taste good the first two ingredients are apple puree and apple juice and the rest of the ingredients are added vitamins minerals plus pectin and wax to give the juice and puree structure yes i know these are full of sugar apple juice concentrate is another way of saying sugar apple flavored but as far as a sugary treat goes this one at least has some vitamins and even a smidge of fiber hidden inside it s tasty and i get my candy craving out of the way it s mostly organic so i don t have to worry about my treat putting pesticides into the environment maybe a real apple is better for you but this will do in a pinch

positive,22/4/21,i m giving this stars because it is rice paper and it does taste good there is a learning curve however to using these without tearing them my first batch was there were wraps in the package and i thought i d bake some spring rolls i think i had splits in about half of them my nd batch went a little better with only about with tears i know i can perfect this with time and patience and these are a really good price so i won t feel bad about playing with my food

positive,1/3/21,the maxwell house peppermint mocha is delicious and easy to prepare my husband and i were both big fans of this drink a cross between hot chocolate and coffee
positive,29/1/21,i am a huge peppermint lover i am also a bit of a picky person when it comes to drink mixes for me many end up being powdery and not as creamy and tasty as i would like that was not the case with maxwell house international coffee peppermint mocha latte mix once you find just the right mixture of powder and hot water you are good to go the container states tsp to oz of boiling water well i always have a big mug when i drink which is about double this not a problem i usually use tsp for my oz mug and it turns out great the peppermint flavor is amazingly refreshing and so delicious it is not overpowering yet is strong enough that the drinker knows it is peppermint flavored for me this is one of the perfect ways to treat myself after a crazy or hectic day curling up with a mug of this peppermint mocha latte and a great book makes a blissful evening i highly recommend this mix to anyone who enjoys peppermint and chocolate
positive,17/4/21,when i started eating these i did not even realized that they were sugarless and low carb they are so delicious the only ones i ve tried are peanut butter i like both crunchy and smooth don t really seem too different i was baffled to see some star reviews but when i read them i saw that everyone was saying that they love these bars but got a terrible quality shipment from amazon so i should add that i only buy these in local stores have never purchased from amazon

positive,28/9/21,i really like these bars the only downside is that they contain maltitol and half of the protein is soy i am not a big soy fan peanut butter is the best
positive,6/5/21,this is very tasty and has a moderate black cherry flavor with some tartness i understand others comments regarding this having a slightly prune juice quality kind of tastes like cherry juice mixed with light prune juice i attribute this to the pasteurization process plus it s not filtered unlike a lot of prepared juices still i like it
positive,20/4/21,my hairdresser has jumped on the keurig bandwagon which makes sense because different people have different tastes this chai latte tasted exactly like a more pricey cup from a coffee shop i was very impressed how quickly it was ready the flavor everything
positive,20/4/21,i get bored with plain water and i drink a lot every day i tried the cherry berry flavrz because i wanted a drink mix that contained no corn syrups or artificial sweetners this product fit the bill and delivered a great tasting drink low cal too try it it really is good

positive,25/5/21,dandy blend has such a great taste to me that it is not necessary to buy any coffee when away from home the packets work great i use a spoonful of sugar and a little non dairy creamer that i also carry with me in my handbag i find i have the dandy blend mixture in the afternoon and it satisfies me i will continue to buy dandy blend
positive,22/5/21,as other reviews have said this tastes pretty good it s the best dried garlic i ve tried mine came in the three pack and i hope i use up the other two before they go stale my only complaint is that you can t unscrew the top you ve got to use the built in grinder or break off the top completely
positive,19/7/21,this is a really good and easy recipe you don t only get the spices but you also get instructions on how to make this complex dish i made it first with chicken and then i substituted it with tofu both times rocked for the price it s a really good buy
positive,25/8/21,i have always made fresh coconut cake filtering the coconut milk grating the meat myself these cupcakes are as close as you can come to ones made from a fresh coconut as with most baked goods if you let them sit a while say at least hours the flavor is even more intense of course they have lots of butter in them so how can they not be good
positive,25/5/21,after reading about yerba mate in eat this not that i had to try it it is a great tasting tea for any tea lover to add to their flavor selection

positive,25/5/21,for people who are gluten sensitive this bread is a god send it is easy to make with a bread maker and has a great taste
positive,7/9/21,we are not gluten free but my mil is i bought this to have on hand when she came out for a visit and then never got around to making it we just made it recently to use it up and get it out of here expecting mediocrity at best but it was surprisingly tasty it had a bouncy springy texture we ate the entire loaf at one meal with bean soup which i keep wishing my kids would like but they won t so they ate a lot of bread so i can t attest to its keeping qualities but fresh from the oven it was great it smelled awful raw so i was skeptical but smelled good baking and tasted great i think i will keep a bag or two around now just as a way to have easy fresh baked bread for dinner and maybe one of these days my kids will learn to like bean soup my husband did the actual mixing as far as i know he followed the directions exactly i may try some of the tweaks suggested next time it does call for an odd amount of eggs that would be the only complaint
positive,15/7/21,this product is easy to make and has a great taste i just wish it was gluten free a simple change in the soy sauce used would make it that way just like the general tsao s chicken by the same company
positive,3/6/21,i like flavored coffees those where you can really taste the flavor it claims to have well this one does it is delicious and you feel like you are enjoying all the calories and good taste of a cinnamon roll in liquid form only you can rejoice because you aren t getting the calories i will be buying this item lots more

positive,7/9/21,i ve been fan of celestial seasonings teas for some time and this is one of my favorites something strange happens in the packing because flavour differs a lot from one box to another the one i m tasting right now has a lot of cinnamon while others have a better balance of ingredients eventhough they all are great teas and the star rating suits them well

positive,15/4/21,i don t usually like rice cakes but these have a nice taste and are very filling the only downside is that this pack comes with so many of them and it takes up a lot of space
positive,19/5/21,these sunflower seeds are larger than the standard sunflower seeds you can usually find in your local supermarket usually the david s brand in my area so there s more inner seed to eat there s also a lighter coating of salt from the brine wash on them so while there s enough salt to make things tasty your lips aren t going to go numb from all the salt quite as quickly as with the other brand the shells are easy to crack with your teeth and they break cleanly also the bags are filled with full shelled seeds there are very few broken ones i devoured the first batch i ordered and i m now ordering a second batch if you like snacking on sunflower seeds i think you ll like these
positive,19/2/21,not much you can say about water i love sparkling water and the addition of some natural lime flavor is great love this and go through about cases a month
positive,14/12/20,okay so it doesn t taste exactly like pumpkin it does sort of have a pumpkin essence however maybe it just sort of smells pumpkin y either way the tea is delicious my co workers tease me about how many cups a day of it that i drink personally i like it with a packet of truvia natura s calorie free sweetener ounce packages pack of or nunaturals nustevia nocarbs blend packets as far as the comment another reviewer made about the black tea tasting like lipton s maybe that makes it more authentic it is said that chai tea was first created in india to make undrinkable tea bearable
positive,28/7/21,the taste is very good oat bran is much more creamy than one minute quick oat it just doesn t tastes like oat a perfect food for somebody on diet just one single tablespoon of oat bran would make you feel very full

positive,15/10/21,i had this cake for my birthday it was delicious it was nice and moist and fluffy and tasted like pumpkin pie without the crust i like the filling for pumpkin pie no bad aftertaste or anything at all we put a dollop of cool whip on top instead of frosting we have had other sweet n low cakes in the past and they have unfortunately tasted lousy this was a pleasant surprise

positive,22/7/19,i really enjoy eating these bars they have a very natural and clean taste to them the only thing i would like to suggest is a less sweet version of these bars are offered they are a little too sweet for my taste but that does not take away from my enjoyment of eating them
positive,2/2/20,i have a gluten allergy so i am always looking for an alternative to cookies muffins granola bars and other sweet snacks that i can no longer eat the kind bars are great i have not found any that i absolutely don t like but some i like better than others the fruit and nuts in yogurt is definitely my favorite i like the combination of nuts raisins and yogurt it does not seem as overpoweringly sweet as some of the others i originally discovered kind bars at starbucks but they were very expensive to buy on a regular basis that was when i checked out amazon s subscribe and save program signed up for the kind bars and cut my purchase cost by more than half with no shipping cost what a cool program especially for those of us with allergies who need regular access to products that are usually expensive and or hard to find
positive,2/2/20,the product was delicious and arrived in a timely fashion however i did see them cheaper at one of those wholesale stores
positive,31/8/19,good product right amount of sodium a little high on calories though kind fruit nut fruit nut delight all natural gluten free bars pack of
positive,22/7/19,these bars taste quite good although i agree with other reviewers that there is a strong coconut taste fine with me as i like coconut i ve ordered three times and the bars have been fresh each time i find them sticky which makes them a bit messy if eaten while hiking or on a road trip everyone i share them with polishes them off quickly personally when i look at the ingredients in kind bars i don t have many fantasies that they are particularly healthy honey is sugar fruit and nuts are concentrated calories healthy fresh fruit vegetables and dairy will do a much better job of ensuring that i get the vitamins minerals and antioxidants that i need gluten free might help some folks i do not doubt that if you eat little pieces of the bars spaced out over several hours they don t encourage glycemic spiking when compared to a snickers or some other candy otherwise i simply regard them as a tasty snack that should not be expected to be anything more than that
positive,12/1/20,these by far are the best tasting gluten free bars ever and at a very reasonable price low in calorie and a great after work out snack
positive,19/2/20,i love the kind bars they taste great and are much healthier than other bars also they satisfy your taste for something sweet so are healthier than eating candy
positive,27/11/19,thought i would just try this and i am glad i did great taste and the delivery was very fast we bbq all the time and i now have a new favorite well worth a try
positive,12/12/19,this organic protein bar tastes great my cousins told me about the organic dark almond chocolate bar this one is good too
positive,26/9/20,it s a spreadable jelly sweet but not too sweet with a flavor of lime it tastes very good for a jelly and i d consider buying it again in the case i wanted to buy jelly
positive,22/7/19,i love these nuts i particularly like the cashews and almonds a bit overpriced though and once you start popping there is no stopping until the pack is done
positive,2/2/20,i bought this hazelnut paste nocciola spread at a local shop in palm cost florida the taste is excellent and healthier than nutella
positive,23/5/20,recently enjoyed these teas at a high end restaurant after returning home we ordered some more online they arrived promptly and were just as delicious
positive,22/11/20,the black walnuts come in large pieces not whole or halved they are fresh taste good and i will buy them again in the future by the way i read in breakthrough eight steps to wellness that black walnuts have some unique health benefits
positive,30/3/20,i love this cereal i ve never been a fan of cocoa crispies but i am a fan of erewhon rice cereals so i decided to give this a shot it s so tasty and addictive without being disgusting sugary like the regular brands that i find myself eating it for breakfast and sometimes dessert
positive,8/7/20,this almond butter tastes very good and it has a pleasing creamy texture i will buy more even though it is expensive it is worth it on my restricted diet because of the convenience and the good taste
positive,4/1/20,this water enhancer was really tasty and you don t have to use a lot of it to flavor even a large glass of water the flavor was good without being overpowering and it s fun using the little bottle my only complaint is the price at per bottle kraft s listed price on their site not amazon s you re paying more for the bottle and the wow factor than the actual flavoring itself while this is a really good product i don t imagine i ll be spending four bucks on less than two ounces of flavoring and a futuristic bottle
positive,30/1/21,i just squeezed some into some water and drank the liquid mixed with the water with little agitation you can use as much or as little as you like i did a second shot my drink was light refreshing and not overly sweet it didn t taste like snapple for example but i enjoyed it i plan on getting more
positive,2/11/20,this offers a quick way for a tasty drink fill up a glass of water and squirt as little or as much as the liquid in the glass and viola peach tea yeah not really peach tea but still tastes pretty darn good they say uses but i probably got only or so since i either wanted my drink a little sweeter or used too big of glasses the current price on amazon suggests more than five dollars a bottle i think that is pretty steep but i would probably purchase some more individual bottles to try other flavors
positive,17/10/20,mio liquid peach tea has a great taste the bottles are small so you can toss one in a backpack or purse and take it with you to add to your bottled water it is easy to add too much to your water so start slow and taste first before adding more i would really recommend this
positive,22/7/19,o n e coconut water is by far the best tasting coconut water i ve had and i ve had just about every brand out there the great taste let us me hydrate my body better than regular water because if o n e wasn t available i would not be able to palate drinking coconut water
positive,2/2/20,o n e has a good taste for packed coconut water if you are used to drink coconut water it is important to know that it will never taste like a fresh green coconut i also make ice cubes with coconut water to use in cocktails and whisky it tastes great
positive,4/10/20,this coconut water takes great i ve tried many other brands and this is one of my favorites and i m not sure why everyone is so worried about the expiration dates i just ordered two boxes from amazon and the expiration date is dec so months from now
positive,8/5/20,this is the only drink that has effectively replaced the urge to drink diet soda for me low in calories and super refreshing at lunch its like i am on a tropical beach looking at the ocean at work now that s nice
positive,18/6/20,i really enjoy this coconut water tastes fresh and has good nutrition with no added ingredients i usually put it in our morning smoothies along with some strawberries bananas and flaxmeal
positive,20/8/20,being originally from a latin american country coconut water is one of those essential summer week end drinks that we not only enjoyed as refreshments but loved for all the no nonsense nutritional information our parents would throw at us about it and though it s been a while since i ve had a real hard shelled coconut spliced open to insert a straw and enjoy this little pack did its job of refreshing me with that wonderful taste and make me feel proud of the nutrition i was getting out of it packaged in a handy little container it keeps the product fresh and with all its flavorful attributes delicious refreshing nutritious it s definitely worth a try and you long for the real thing but are far from a tropical beach this might be your best substitute
positive,1/6/21,it s light and refreshing i ve tasted fresh coconut water right out from the coconut the western coconuts like the ones from the caribbean are a bit on the salty side but the sweet ones are from the tropical areas in the far east like indonesia so comparing this to the western coconut water it s way better and much more refreshing comparing this to the indonesian coconut water it s below par all in all it s still pretty good
positive,4/7/21,what a great thing to wake up to i feel these k cups are of medium strength with just enough of kahula
positive,5/2/20,what would i do without amazon this is the only place where i can find all the keurig existing and the price is great the coffee tastes good does not taste like alcohol just coffee like good buy
positive,22/7/19,if you like kahlua this is a great coffee the aroma is wonderful as it brews and the flavor is mild not overpowering
positive,2/2/20,this was the best ever fruitcake loaded with fruit and nuts lite on the cake as it should be not like others all cake and not much in the way fruit and nuts the only problem i had is that it s all gone and fast must now order more
positive,22/11/20,i could not find this tea locally anymore so i m glad i found it at amazon i ve been drinking this tea for a number of years now and probably wouldn t go back to regular tea
positive,1/3/20,lipton french vanilla is hands down one of the most delicious black teas available i am thankful i can continue to purchase it through amazon since it is no longer available in stores
positive,23/11/20,this is my favorite lipton tea sadly all the stores in my town have stopped selling it so i have resorted to buying it at amazon let us pray they don t stop offering it
positive,5/4/21,i like to munch a few nuts as a snack in moderation a lot better for one than eating potato chips this is a nice taste treat there is a smoky taste to the almonds which is to the good on the down side there is probably too much salt here unfortunately since salt produces health problems for people so i wouldn t want to eat these tasty treats every day but as a snack from time to time these almonds really hit the spot
positive,27/4/20,i bought these gums not knowing what to expect but as soon as i tried the first one i knew i made a good choice these things are great not too hard and not too soft and they are really sweet but don t taste artificial would highly recommend this product
positive,8/3/21,i went this way and that way for almost a month before ordering and when i finally did order these chips i wish i had ordered more i made the mistake of sharing with friends we all love this product and it is perfect for anything from snacking and dipping to use in casseroles excellent flavor and taste love them nutritional value is not that bad compared to alternatives but chips are chips and these are worth it
positive,30/1/20,i really like this soup and i m typically not a big vegetable soup eater the one thing i want to mention is that in the ingredients i believe yeast extract is just another name for message
positive,22/7/19,item as described texture of gummy softer than a normal gummy bear probably due to size very good though
positive,2/2/20,another great tasting gluten free product has lots of flavor and because they are individually wrapped they are great to include in a packed lunch
positive,2/9/20,this is a very nice full bodied coffee with a very delicious taste it s a nice favored coffee to wake up to in the morning i would reccommend this coffee to a person who likes a medium strength and blend coffee
positive,26/1/21,i am not a health nut and i had to keep an open mind with this product but once i tried it it actually tasted really good just a tip don t eat it by itself not good try it with smoked salmon and cream cheese or make an avocado and turkey sandwich also toasting it for a few minutes will soften it a bit
positive,9/1/21,the dried mango has a very good taste very sweet the chunks are not difficult to eat like some other brands the only but is the pieces are a bit too small to my taste
positive,30/7/21,i will definitely order this again it melts in your mouth the texture is light when i brought it to work the whole bag disappeared in minutes
positive,30/10/20,good value easy to dispense and they taste great my husband has them for a snack every day and has me reorder when they start getting down he wants them on hand
positive,3/8/20,i ve been gluten free for about three months and as someone with a sweet tooth i ve been a bit bummed lately at the lack of easy and quick treats i can find or keep on hand i went to the health food store and bought one of these individually to give it a try i opened it in the car and almost went back in for more right then only the rain and a need to get on with my day held me back i will most definitely be buying more if you like macaroons these are fairly similar crunchy but chewy soft sweet and tasty
positive,29/1/21,i bought these because i didn t get the almond balls these coconut nut butter balls tastes much better my kid likes it too
positive,24/10/21,these breadsticks were wonderful with hummus and spinach dip wonderfully light and crisp with just a hint of herbs i ll also add addicting i rated it only a star because the shipping was careless half the boxes contained broken breadsticks and i really wanted to serve them upright hopefully amazon will take note and ship with padding next time
positive,24/10/21,a great coffee at a great price i subscribed for regular delivery now i will always have the perfect cup just seconds away
positive,16/10/21,my wife likes flavored coffee and this is by far her favorite great taste medium brew excellent value too we order this brew regularly guests enjoy this coffee as wel
positive,24/10/21,i have purchased many different brands of this type of fruit this is by far the best tasting of all i have tried it has no off putting bite to it many do i love it so much i cannot stop making my homemade pannatone i guess i can thank you for these extra pounds if you use this type of product i am italian so i do i highly encourage you to give it a try maria domenica
positive,25/9/21,i bought this pack from amazon as i had one of the flavors at the local market and wanted to try some new ones it tastes great make sure to follow the recommendations some flavors say do not shake and some flavors say shake slightly
positive,19/10/21,pops up great in the microwave a handful of kernels in a brown paper lunch bag folded up and taped shut for minutes with almost no leftover kernels i m a popcorn seasoning junkie but this popcorn is so fresh and flavorful that a little butter and salt does the job it s also been my experience so far that snappy is a little less prone to getting scorched than grocery store popcorn higher moisture content maybe either way it s nice to have fewer unpleasant burnt surprises
positive,20/10/21,i love the quantity and flavor of this tea it s a little messy opening the pouches the matcha can get all over your fingers and counter but oh well i purchase this at costco because the price is way better my only complaint is that i wish it were organic
positive,19/10/21,great tasting snack like viewer said taste like sugar smacks my husband and i enjoy eating the puffed cakes calories fat awesome puffed cakes and a glass of fat free milk is good eating thank you amazon jesus bless us all
positive,15/6/21,all flavors were very good often times with variety packs you end up with some good flavors and some not so good flavors but the whole family ate all flavors up in no time
positive,4/8/21,i am very pleased with this sherry vinegar it is a little costly but has a wonderful robust taste and really makes a tasty vinegrette
positive,4/8/21,these go great for movie watching with the kids at home the amount of the candies sold here will last for many movie nights
positive,18/7/21,tasty and soft my toddler just loves them they are a little pricey and there are very few fruit snacks in a bag
positive,18/10/21,its a great tasting energy boost i ve tried a few of the energy drinks out there and never liked the taste or the jittery feeling i got i highly recommend the raspberry acai drink
positive,15/6/21,i bought this salt on a lark because i didn t want to drive miles to the nearest store that carried natural sea salt but i will buy it again the flavor is wonderful i m not a big salt eater never have been just don t like the taste of commercial salt but this sea salt is wonderful i real winner that enhances the flavor of food instead of covering it up as regular salt does
positive,4/8/21,good quality rice cooks well and has a good overall flavor no need to rinse first as with most asian rice
positive,8/6/21,i have been looking for gluten free plain crackers for ages being pregnant all i wanted in my first trimester was some plain crackers but i thought i had no options being celiac there s some nice rice crackers out there but they all are flavored with onion garlic bbq etc not things you want during pregnancy i found these recently in a local high end grocery store and was so happy to see plain i tried them and i had to laugh at myself for getting so excited over plain crackers they are super good with by themselves or with butter cream cheese etc they are great for soup as they are full of flavor and have a crispy taste they are also not high in salt like most other crackers great buy too i highly recommend if you like me just want some nice crackers without the salty flavor added to them
positive,15/6/21,surprisingly tasty and a great texture i was excited to find these in my local grocery store in the passover section my expectations were low but these delicious crackers made me a believer
positive,4/8/21,i bougth yahuda matzo style last month i wanted to try it before passover i love the taste and texture the biggest problem is that about a third of the box i opened arrived in crumbles i did not check the other boxes because i need them unopened for passover i hope the boxes arrived in better condition i will try and make matzah balls with the crumbs and use them as a coating or toppng at these prices i am not going to waste any of it i am going to buy another pack of so that i will have enough to serve during the holiday for myself and family members who can not eat wheat i hope you keep this item in stock as long as possible as we eat matzah all year long
positive,25/9/21,this would have gotten stars but i decided due to the fact it is pricey and i feel it could be more reasonably priced than it is otherwise i was hoping it would be my answer to a saltine cracker that i miss so much due to being gluten intolerant i was very pleasantly surprised the cracker was very tasty and had a nice crunch it is perfect to crumble in tomato soup or to eat plain or with anything on it i really love this product it makes a great snack when i just have to have something to crunch on
positive,19/10/21,if you are a coffee lover this is the way to go grind these fresh beans and make a full strong coffee that is delicious
positive,4/9/21,the coffee beans are great fresh and shipped fast great prices will continue to order these coffee beans as long as they stay fresh and reasonably priced
positive,31/8/21,my girlfriend uses this product in her coffee to disguise the coffee taste instead of using sugar she adds half a package and some milk she loves it it tastes great on its own too
positive,9/10/21,we were eating a meal in hawaii with some aloha shoyu on the table we didn t think anything of it until we tried some and found that this tastes really good different from kikkoman and the like if you like soy sauce be sure to try some of this
positive,15/6/21,i love how fast you can fix this thai peanut in the take out type of box just add hot water ster then eat it tastes great and is fast to fix this is not the same thi peanut that comes in a regal type of box that is cooked in a pan on the stove top i like the taste of this one better and it is easier to fix
positive,4/8/21,i searched long and hard for this product and i was thrilled to learn that they had the exact ice bars that i was searching for the customer service was the best and shipping was extremely fast thank you for making a hard to find product in the you s accessible and the costs were reasonable i will definitely order again from this seller
positive,15/6/21,this syrup is an amazing addition to any kitchen it s delicious and smooth and goes very well with chai tea
positive,4/8/21,great price for a great product this is much more subtle than green tea and tastes great with a little cinnamon
positive,15/6/21,excellent product and excellent service from this seller lime pickle is a must have relish as part of an indian feast but my favorite everyday use is as a garnish to tuna salad
positive,4/8/21,it was pleasant to receive these in good condition the cups were inside a cardboard box while inside another main cardboard box with bubble padding none of the cups broke
positive,1/10/21,i rarely can find this on the keurig website it s usually sold out plus it s more expensive if you love chocolate you should love this i recommend it
positive,1/7/18,the kids in our son s party were super excited that they had flavors to choose from before i made their cotton candy and what colorful flavors too cherry grape were the favorites the cherry and blue raspberry were the most colorful
positive,10/8/18,this was a good purchase tastes good pretty colors seems to go a long way i used at a family reunion with a bunch of kids and they raved about it i hope what was not used holds up for next year i put it away so as not to be tempted very happy
positive,1/7/18,these sugars are so good they make great light fluffy cotton candy they work extremely well compared to using hard candy they all taste great i would highly recommend these for anyone making homemade cotton candy they taste as great as boardwalk cotton candy
positive,10/8/18,healthy choice fresh mixers are a tasty option when you need a quick microwave meal on the go with their compact nonperishable packaging these things are perfect for carrying to the office in your purse so the office cadger won t steal them the pasta turns out just right and the sauce is pretty good too the rotini with zesty marinara sauce has a nice garlicy zing to it the portion size is just right for an entree it is a little small if it s comprising your entire meal but if you re eating at your desk chances are you didn t have time for a full meal anyway the plastic handles on the bowl stay cool enough to make it easy to transport this to your desk no more trying to find the tepid spot on a flaming hot piece of microwaved cardboard so you can goose walk it down the hall before your fingers burn a couple of things lowered my rating by one star for one there is a bit more sodium than i m entirely comfortable with in a product aimed at the health conscious mg two there s quite a bit of plastic packaging with this meal it s nicely layered into a small package that can easily fit into a purse or briefcase but when you take the layers apart you can t help but think of landfills or the great oceanic garbage patch all in all this is still a decent option for days when you know you re going to be too busy to either go to the deli or make a sack lunch with bean curds to turn off any would be fridge thieves
positive,13/9/18,my favorite cereal period i enjoy this every morning with some unsweetened almond milk taste so much better than the similar cheerios but has nearly twice the fiber you can t go wrong with this
positive,17/7/18,i love eating soba noodles and this is the best sauce i have found so far i just add some scallions and it is awesome
positive,16/1/19,this price is amazing we are a whole foods family and we use this for our baking and on our waffles and we love it way cheaper then the grocery store
positive,16/1/19,smells more like blueberry than it tastes however it make a great iced tea and sweetens nicely with agave syrup i enjoy it
positive,1/8/20,i have opened hundereds ifnot thousands of cans of peeled italian tomotoes and for the money these are as good as i have ever had as good or better than campania pomidori pelati very red rich and sweet
positive,1/7/18,these are great tasting it s like a mix of raisin bran and honey bunches of oats i did the subscribe and save and it really does save you money
positive,10/8/18,over years of gluten free baking this mix is the best chocolate cake mix that i ve tried i usually find other gluten free cake mixes to be pretty dry this one made very moist cupcakes with great chocolate flavor i don t think i d be able to tell the difference between this and a cake made with wheat flour and they were easy to frost no stray crumbs sticking to the frosting spatula i will definitely buy this one again
positive,15/2/20,i was very pleased when this arrived at the door opened it immediately dug in wasn t till later when my wife got home told me it was for the dog not me just kidding our dog does like this beneful we get many compliments on her smooth coat she s fit full of fun energy very healthy dry dog food has added advantage if you have to curb your pet dogs do like variety too beneful has several different flavors you may want to change it up every other bag or so this lb bag lasts about a month for our lb lab sounds funny for a dog to be eating corn tomatoes other veggies the reality is these ingredients are fillers to keep the cost down other brands may be healthier but are going to be more expensive we selected this brand because that is what the rescue center fed her and our vet said this was fine
positive,22/4/21,tastes great no bad smell as others mentioned came in days with prime and no problems haven t experienced any gas yet i m trying to build my tolerance slowly
positive,25/9/20,i really enjoy this peanut butter it is sweet and a treat it is not entirely smooth it has a slight granule texture maybe because of the honey mixed in otherwise it is one less jar to grab if you like honey and peanut butter
positive,16/11/19,i just started taking benecol smart chews so i don t know yet if they will lower my cholesterol i am writing this review so other people will try them and not be afraid that they taste bad they really are good they taste just like a carmel candy

positive,15/1/20,i love the taste of the benecol smart chews i m hooked on these and my mom is also taking them it s great to have something taste good and help your cholesterol thank you
positive,1/9/20,this product was recommended to a group of us ladies by a cardiologist who spoke at one of our meetings she said her patients were getting fantastic results taking this to help them lower their cholesterol ldl levels my ldl needs to be lowered by points and i don t want to take medication so i decided to give this a try i have taken it for two months but it will be a few more months before i have my cholesterol level checked at that time i will know if this works in addition to taking this i ve been eating steel cut oatmeal for breakfast and have cut way back on beef
positive,22/7/21,was recommended to drink hibiscus tea to lower blood pressure hibiscus tea is expensive this is not as expensive and tastes good too i would drink this even if not for high blood pressure comes in a big zipper close bag in retail box best deal on hibiscus tea
positive,1/7/18,i bought two different teas from this company and they both where very good this was my first time purchasing anything from them and i was very pleased with the integrity and strength of the tea
positive,10/8/18,i really like halter bonbons they have a genuine fruit taste and are not icky sweet like some sugar free candy cherry strawberry and orange are my favorites i do wish they came individually wrapped they are often hard to find and somewhat pricey but in my view they are worth it
positive,14/5/21,so i bought these when i saw a great deal on deals woot com about a coupon they had and i had seen them in stores a few times but never took the plunge these are tasty although sometimes a little hard for my taste and a little higher in calories than i would like in a snack calories per bag but it does satifsy my sweet tooth nicely and is much better than candy or a donut and easy to tuck in my gym bag or desk drawer the single size is nice because it s easier to do portion control than counting out chips into a plastic baggie still on the fence if i would order again but that s because of calories not taste taste is great
positive,3/10/21,this syrup tastes very good not quite as good as starbucks but comes close
positive,15/9/20,i use this every morning for the protein low calorie lots of protein and i love the coffee flavor not a fan of the hot but i throw it in my magic bullet with ice and water frozen and delicious
positive,30/8/20,this protein drink tastes great and i only make it with water it s probably be even better in a smoothie
positive,1/7/18,i don t usually like protein drinks i do love coffee and was looking for a good iced coffee mix this fits the bill perfectly plus it s good for me i find the vanilla flavor very nice the texture not very chalky and the amount in the canister perfect i mix with milk never tried water it might not be as tasty that way
positive,10/8/18,i like this protein powder on its own it is too sweet and has more caffeine than i should have at one time so i mix one scoop of it with a scoop of eas whey chocolate protein powder and it makes the perfect protein drink for me i use this product daily
positive,5/12/19,i ve been drinking the mocha click on a daily basis for almost years now and was very excited to hear a new flavor was coming out the vanilla click is very good and a good option if you don t like the slightly thicker consistency of the mocha click i ll be ordering both flavors each month from now on
positive,21/10/19,i was originally using the morning blend which had a good taste but i think this blend is smoother also the price is a little less so it s a win win situation
positive,8/9/20,this is one of the best peanut butters i have ever tasted a bare minimum of sugar and exactly the spice level i would have expected to the person who gave it a one star common that is ridiculous you should have atleast given three stars for innate quality and being a product that actually lives up to the label omg spicy peanut butter actually being spicy who would have thought
positive,22/9/21,i was a little hesitant to buy the cocoa bean flavor after reading the reviews saying that it s not the same as chocolate because most of the proteins i ve been using are chocolate flavored i m glad i ended up with cocoa bean i took the advice of some other comments to heat it up and it really does taste good as hot chocolate the other thing i like about it is that it mixes very well with water when i m at the gym i don t really have a choice between water and milk but it s not a problem with this protein
positive,2/10/20,great taste i have tried many types of protein this one was by far the best i have ever had
positive,25/7/20,i bought my first rj s soft licorice log today and it is absolutely the best black licorice i have ever tasted
positive,4/7/21,excellent old world flavor and style it has been years since i had salame this good or natural no message etc almost impossible to find anyplace else i wish someone locally carried it but i am glad i can get it online
positive,11/9/21,i drink this between brazilian jiu jitsu and submission wrestling class to recharge taste great lime is my fav
positive,4/7/21,this product tastes better than other coconut juices i have tried i love that it is not sweetened i would prefer it come in disposable cartons rather than cans but to me the taste makes it worth purchasing i like this size also because the larger sizes are too much for me to drink at a time the size makes it great for lunches and snacks too
positive,21/9/21,i discovered think thin products at my local trader joe s market but the per bar price was a bit high then i saw that amazon sold them and had so many more flavors i have been ordering them one by one this is one of my favorites i like the crunch of the nuts and the sweetness of the white chocolate it may be a little too sweet i like the darker chocolate with the nuts better but if you re looking for a different taste with the crunch of nuts this is a good choice i use them as a breakfast food mostly they don t raise my blood glucose and that s good
positive,11/9/21,tried all crunch bars was pleasantly surprised with taste of each not as filling as the high protein think thin bars but good for light snack very nutty sweet a keeper
positive,12/10/21,these make a great snack not too sweet and an excellent way to get fiber into your diet
positive,11/10/21,the product is fresh tasting and enjoyed it i had trouble with the lid which kept falling off and was soon lost
positive,28/9/21,honeysuckle pear is one of three flavors of drink chia i personally like the strawberry and mango more but this one still tastes good some of my friends like this one more than the others they only have calories and grams of sugar and contain lots of omega mg omega iron potassium calcium fiber protein magnesium they are extremely healthy this is all from the chia seeds you can see inside which gives it a texture that is new and fun to drink the seeds themselves absorb more than ten times their weight in water so when you drink them they hold onto it keeping you hydrated longer great for workouts and sports it s all in an oz bottle so it s easy to carry in a bag or in your hand wherever you go
positive,19/10/21,this is the best waffle mix around can t find in the store but glad that i was able to find them online for such a reasonable price
positive,4/7/21,this tastes exactly like the white hot cocoa i ve always gotten from my coffee shop have i found their source would definitely recommend
positive,11/9/21,nice mild taste though there is a strong fish odor in the juice the cats loved that there are a lot of bones and skin reminds me of when mom would make sardine sandwiches very tasty though and no after taste and though no salt is great i m going to try the no bones or skin type next wild caught is great too
positive,12/9/21,i am usually not the biggest fan of green teas but this is really really good it has a third of the caffeine as an ounce coffee with lemongrass spearmint passion fruit and plum flavors i was an instant fan and the fact that it is healthy for your immune and digestive system are added bonuses
positive,13/7/21,if you like apricots or peaches this is the energy bar for you it is completely natural tasty not overtly sweet and the minis are a prefect dessert or snack size buying it on amazon is the best deal i found for these especially with the subscribe and save option in grocery stores you are paying close to for the same box
positive,23/10/21,these little nut squares are delicious there is just enough sweetness to make you feel like you have had a real treat but not so much that you get a sugar high with a crash nuts have protein so these snacks stay with you and give you a needed boost in the middle of the day or anytime
positive,22/9/21,i wish gevalia came with an option for whole beans but as pre ground coffee goes this makes a great sunday morning treat it may be a little rich for some people as an everyday cofffee but if you like candy coffee you will probably like this
positive,4/7/21,this product is the usual gevalia finely ground coffee full strength it did not seem be all that great i enjoyed it much better when i blended the product with regular coffee maybe it is just the way i brew coffee that is wrong or i have the wrong kind of brewer basket instead of cone like the gevalia brand brewers i am not a big fan of flavored coffee of any brand because i think they processor can mask poor grade product with fancy additives it has very good dark chocolate flavor i am not sure how good a value it will as i do not have access to that info at this point
positive,11/9/21,i ve been wary of trying this since most people complained about the chocolate being quite tart thank goodness i gave into my own curiosity my boyfriend and i love this treat it was originally for him but once i had a bite i pretty much took it from him and nibbled like a hungry mouse the sweet blend of chocolate and strawberry flavor is amazing i wish i had purchased more of these bars
positive,8/8/21,taste fantastic somewhat hot if you consume a lot of it at once but nothing to be fearful of it s the perfect hand made taste hot sauce to replace your over the counter cholula tapatio for all of you meal choices
positive,9/7/21,we love this cereal one of my daughters eats this every morning for breakfast i like that it doesn t get soggy so quickly i have even used this to make gluten free rice crispie treats we subscribe to this and a case arrives every month at a price you can t beat
positive,24/10/21,i ordered the chocolate and peanut butter cereal i made granola bars for my husband who has celiac disease they were very good even i could not help myself to this yummy treat
positive,4/7/21,armed with her recipe book and flour blend we are able to make fabulous gluten free food the only bad thing is we make way more desserts than we should because they are just that good not only are they so good that you can t tell they are gluten free but they are better than anything i have ever made gluten or not delicious
positive,11/9/21,the maple syrup tastes really good and sweet i use it in cooking and on pancakes a good deal i will buy it again i like supporting a us family company too
positive,24/10/21,this sauce has a unique flavor and a decent kick i like a very hot sauce and this is not as strong as my usual choice it does however have a very unique flavor that i enjoyed i have used it on a number of dishes and was really impressed with the way it jazzed up my homemade vegetable soup i will be buying this again
positive,22/6/21,i ve long been a fan of the maxwell house international coffee line so i was excited to try this flavor if you are a fan of other pumpkin spice drinks at unnamed large coffee chains you will definitely like this product i like that you are able to add the amount that you want and the mix blends very nicely and evenly this is a perfect treat for a cold winter s night
positive,30/7/21,my wife and i have been eating these for over a year and really like them we slightly prefer them to newman s own but of course that s personal taste
positive,10/7/21,i eat oatmeal almost every morning in the fall and winter this is by far my favorite variety pack i stock up when it is on sale because i can go through a box a week the variety pack is nice because it keeps it from getting monotonous peaches and cream is the tastiest and nothing beats hot oatmeal after shoveling snow or walking the dog
positive,4/7/21,second week in a row in the lighting deals pick it up fast great taste but very light after taste
positive,11/9/21,i received this gift box as a gift and completely overlooked all the other candy in my house i am going through a total eighties phase right now and this retro candy was perfect i don t know what else to say except that i love this candy gift box
positive,20/9/21,this tea has a wonderful taste of blueberry it s even wonderful iced as a treat for family and guests alike everyone who i have surved it to has loved it
positive,13/10/21,i ve never been a coffee drinker so i ve always ignored keurig machines i got these since my office has a machine and really enjoy it the tea tastes perfectly brewed if you like english tea and have access to a keurig this is worth the purchase price
positive,2/8/21,as always this tea was quite tasty but it was delivered to a home a block away that is vacant so i had to retrieve it highly recommend the tea use it alone but sparingly or mix it with a black tea to mellow the flavor
positive,11/6/21,as many other reviewers pointed out this is a very spicy tea with a strong cinnamon taste it is absolutely delicious with no added sweeteners and is the go to tea in our house
positive,2/8/21,a friend introduced me this good earth tea which i found very flavorful the first time i tried it i was glad to find that i could buy the tea on amazon and have now given it as a present to another tea lover
positive,18/10/21,i like corn and come from the northeast where fresh local corn is a common spring summer side item so i d like to think i know from corn i tried a can of glory s corn over the winter by way of comparison and thought it was pretty tasty good stuff
positive,23/7/21,the switch watermelon strawberry was a good drink i thought it was a little too sweet for my taste but not by much one serving size was fluid ounces it contains grams of sugar and grams of carbs per serving and each serving was calories according to the label it contains of the recommended daily allowance of vitamin c the drink has a slight carbonation to it that was a lot less than soda the small and skinny can makes it good for inclusion in a lunch box although i liked it i don t think it s worth the price of nearly a can but for the convenience of size it might be worth the trade off on occasion
positive,8/7/21,i like this fqavor of this product a lot and if you want carbonated fruit juice then this is the stuff for you i do suggest though that you refrigerate it because it does taste better cold
positive,11/6/21,this stuff taste just like flavored carbonated water in this case flavored with strawberries and watermelon i imagine it s better for you than plain soda i really found it tasty yet not overpowering in it s flavor as some of the other flavors
positive,25/6/21,loved this drink the sweetness level was just right and i really liked the fact this is juice without corn syrup or refined sugar i didn t really think the watermelon strawberry tasted like watermelon or strawberry but it was a really nice pleasant flavor the carbonation was just right i also liked that this drink didn t leave a weird aftertaste or a lingering flavor on the tongue like some other sodas or juice drinks this had a very clean flavor that was very refreshing
positive,2/8/21,i love the taste of this tea it didn t induce my labor only walking seemed to get the ball rolling and of course i can t tell you if it toned any of my lady parts but i had a very quick smooth labor so maybe it did something i am now weeks postpartum and i m about to order more just because i like the taste of it i enjoy this one much better than the milk maid super satisfied
positive,11/6/21,this company is very accommodating and was quick to re ship my missing ups shipped order the general manager took care of the problem personally and quickly this company definitely has my future business they have a fantastic product and even better customer service
positive,9/7/21,i absolutely love this product and most of the flavors it is not sold in stores by me any longer so was delighted to find it here much better than the same type of drink sold by the other big name company s
positive,22/6/21,i am surprised by many of the reviews that are here especially those saying this coffee tastes weak when i serve it to company they often ask about it and can t believe it s decaf it has the heavier taste of starbucks which i love i use the normal amount for a greaat cup of coffee
positive,2/8/21,this is the best ham base they also make excellent chicken beef mushroom and veggie base i have ever used it works great for ham gravy and ham soup it enhances ham flavor in many ham dishes too made with natural ham pieces and no message a little goes a long way for making gravy highly recommended for ham lovers
positive,11/6/21,if you purchase this your money is well spend this product from guyana is perfect and taste better than the yr
positive,8/7/21,the only thing you re missing by eating this instead of wheat pasta is the carbs it s got a really great light taste the the bag makes a deceivingly large amount of cooked pasta
positive,28/9/21,very tasty slightly smokey tea as appropriate to this type a little dusty thus the stars vs but did not seem to seriously effect flavor would recommend to others for the price organic is a plus
positive,23/8/21,this is great almond butter i was buying almond butter at whole foods and the last two containers were watery i thought i d give this a try and i m glad i did
positive,1/8/21,we can no longer find these baked guiltless courmet in our area stores so i am delighted to be able to buy them in bulk at a terrific savings from amazon they were shipped very quickly and were intact and delicious
positive,16/7/21,this espresso has a very smooth coffee taste i used it first in a press and then in my mr coffee espresso machine the espresso definetly tasted better when pressed the price was excellent considering you get cans
positive,2/8/21,i started taster s choice from original gourmet after i bought french roast i found it labeled darker than the one i was drinking i am afraid that it will be too strong after i tasted it i am so glad that it is the right taste for me it is so convenient i love it and highly recoment it
positive,11/6/21,we ve been enjoying this seasoning on our steaks for some time but this packaging is an great improvement we first started buying it at a wholesale club where it was sold in a plastic grinder the grinder was a pain in the wrist to use i m so glad that weber now sells it pre ground in a shake on container plus the grill lid shaped cap is a cute touch i definitely recommend this seasoning as it s just the right combination of flavors for a charcoal grilled steak i d even use it on chicken or pork as well
positive,26/6/21,i love taco bell so i knew i would love this sauce i have used it on chicken veggies baked potatoes and most recently i put it on my mashed potatoes you can use this in many ways salads meats etc the taste is creamy rich and spicy but not too spicy it has a little kick to it and if you like jalapenos then you will like this i am not a big fan of alot of spices and when i cook i really cook plain but i do like this product it s not too much and not too little if you want to add a little zest to your every day meals this is a good way to go this is an update weeks later ok for me this sauce is not too spicy however i served it times to company one time i used it as a dipping sauce for veggies and another time i used it for a topping on taco night in my house both times my friends and family said it was too spicy for them i personally like a kick but they all found it too spicy but they loved loved the taste it was just too spicy one of my friends actually started coughing and asked for a glass of water so if you like spice but not heat this is a great sauce there are many many ways to use this and it really can stretch your budget by adding zest to boring ole chicken and fish however it may be too spicy for those of you not used to it but it tastes great
positive,20/8/21,i put this on some basically a chicken fajita and was not bad like taco bell s other sauces this one does recreate a taco bell type taste which may be a good or bad thing depending on your perspective i still like taco bell s spicy ranchero sauce better despite being jalapeno this is not a very spicy product
positive,25/8/21,just wanted to let everyone know that i have been using crystal light packets for most of this year ever since i tried one actually i like the lemonade in summer but i like the iced tea year round and it s actually my favorite what i usually do is use a gatorade bottle after it s been emptied or drank of course and fill it with ice from the ice maker since those cubes fit put the crystal light in add water and shake instead of buying water i just refill it from the tap and re use the bottle great taste and easy to make
positive,19/10/21,this maamoul has a good taste for both the date and the cookies it s soft and doesn t smell bad because of the packing i recommend it
positive,2/8/21,good quality very tasty complex and smoky flavor very mild though break it up into bags and freeze it if you don t drink it everyday
positive,11/6/21,we ve been using this syrup for years and now so easy to have it delivered right to our door wife is diabetic and we really watch her carbs she s been able to stay off shots for years now with products like this we can t tell any taste difference from regular we used to before the new sweeteners came out we have noticed when we ask for sugar free syrup when we eat out this is the only brand restaurants carry
positive,22/10/21,my wife introduced me to these we bought them at the japanese store in epcot after we d eaten the two we bought i wanted to find them on the web so i was pleased to see you could get them at amazon this is a tasty noodle dish it s not what i first thought a soup it is really noodles with a spicy mustard mayo soy sauce mix it s easy to prepare as well the ingredients are all with the pack and it just requires boiling water the container is pretty neat too a built in strainer that let us you prepare the noodles and then drain the water without needing any additional utensils or bowls it s a little expensive if you just want ramen noodles it s much more exotic i am going to try it
positive,6/8/21,taste just like reg animal crackers i love them tried them from the grocery store first in the mexican food section they are delicious
positive,24/6/21,it s moist it is filled with all the things i love in fruitcake candied cherries dates and lots of pecans and none of the stuff i don t like best of all it s available year round i am also impressed with the service the carrier dropped it off on my porch last night this morning i had an email from the folks at organic mountain making sure i had received it
positive,17/4/21,the reason why i bought this because it s using halal beef the taste is great a little sweet and not to chewy we love it and will order more later will recommend to my friends
positive,10/3/21,i was so happy to find the green mountain coffee pumpkin spice on amazon com it is a seasonal product that i absolutely fell in love with over christmas some of the other pumpkin spice flavored k cups that i have tried smelled really nice but had absolutely no flavor this one fills the kitchen with that spicy aroma and has a full flavor i even run through a nd shot on smaller cup size it has that much flavor
positive,17/4/21,this is definitely my all time favorite flavored keurig k cup pretty much tastes like a pumpkin spice latte from starbucks
positive,21/1/21,i was apprehensive of buying a flavord coffee i had a bad run in with a cinnamon flavored coffee recently this pumpkin spice coffee is very tasty it smells good and it leaves my dorm room with a plesant aroma the only downside to this coffee is it is a very light roast
positive,30/1/21,it was great to find this caribbean cake here its truely a real caribbean rum cake i was in puerto rico only weeks ago for days and i could not find a caribbian cake anywhere thanks to amazon
positive,13/2/21,these rum cakes taste really great i get them for myself and also get them as gifts last year i bought one for everyone on my team at work they absolutety loved them and talked about how soft and moist they are i am glad i know where to find them as i buy them all the time
positive,15/1/21,this is the best rum cake i ve ever tasted the first time i had this was in the cayman islands to know i can stay here and still get them is even better
positive,6/3/21,moist delicious with a delectable rum flavor it was a bit on the very sweet side but overall a memorable dessert experience
positive,7/1/21,not sure if it works but taste is good like a caramel first got it in china town desided to buy again
positive,17/4/21,i used to live in baton rouge louisiana and learned from my relatives to brew and enjoy community coffee preparing it in my little white porcelain beggin just like my grandmother and aunts i make my own blend of coffee beans and was so pleased to see that amazon was now selling community coffee it is as good as i remember if being particularly since i like a very strong rich flavor i m now using their sumatran french roast expresso and columbian to make my blends and am very happy with the results so are my relatives and friends who ask to use my blends themselves great coffee from the land of strong coffee lovers i m moving on to chicory laced coffee now as community carries it personally i like this brand much better than other louisiana coffees
positive,10/3/21,i love this tea it s so refreshing i drink it regularly and was able to buy it on subscribe and save through amazon so making the price very affordable
positive,14/1/21,over the years this chili powder has gotten harder to find it has been a staple of our family s chili for decades and i am very glad to be able to still purchase it it has a perfect blend of seasonings that requires nothing more than ground beef onions and tomato soup to make an outstanding bowl of chili williams chili seasoning bulk mix oz
positive,24/5/21,i was unaware this is not a factory sealed product that s the only con i would have about this product it s high quality tastes great and a great value i will purchase again
positive,14/10/21,this is a close match to sugar and is supposed to be better for you than other artificial sweeteners a little expensive
positive,7/2/21,my daughter cannot get enough of these delicious snacks and i have a pretty hard time telling her no since they are made of nothing but pure organic pureed fruits the packaging is fantastic to toss into your bag for on the go too all the flavors are great and if you want to try them before committing to a bulk amount starbucks now carries the line in store
positive,29/3/21,this organic baby food is very tasty but has a very thin consistency my son has to drink it it is also very sweet nice as a desert but not for a meal for my month old
positive,17/4/21,this tea tastes fantastic the flavour is not bitter at all as with other green teas and i keep brewing the same leaves about times a day and still get really excellent flavour the packaging was also great as it came in a sealable pouch that kept the leavs fresh will definitely continue to purchase this tea in the future
positive,10/3/21,it s always a matter of choice on what types of food you enjoy and this product is one of those that i love you won t miss the taste of hotdogs anymore with this product and forget about the calorie and meat content this is the bomb in grilling
positive,10/7/21,i received the chicken pill pockets for my cat and he loves them what an idea the order was fast and the price was fantastic this is where i will order them from now on thank you sooo much
positive,27/1/21,hot from the toaster add a scoop of ice cream i like chocolate drizzle with some hot fudge sauce and a dollop of whipped cream ooooo it s too good not just a toaster pastry anymore
positive,1/6/21,i was a bit skeptical on ordering a spirulina bar it is soooo green i must say it is one of my favorites to eat before going to the gym not grainy nor too sweet it gives me just enough energy to work hard without exhaustion the small size is just right so no need to save half for another time it is an excellent edition to a raw diet
positive,20/8/21,this cake was super easy to make it tasted great and had an absolutly awesome texture the mouth feel of the cake is nothing like most microwaved treats even people who regularly eat wheat would be very surprised this is a wheat free and microwave product give the taste and texture the texture is very soft and light and not at all grainy the cake tastes like a cinnamon donut in terms of degree of sweetness and the cinnnamon flavor is very authentic and high quality tasting the cake delivers a completely authentic cake experience but you should know it is not supper pretty to look at and does not come with any topping as might be suggested by the label art if you are giving it as a special treat to someone as a birthday cake for instance you might want to spread some gluten free icing or whipped cream cheese on it to improve the aesthetic effect this would be a great purchase to keep in the pantry as an emergency treat or to keep at work as a courtesy maybe if you are doing a birthday and it turns out someone is on a gluten free diet really what this kit is perfect for is when you are at a motel with a microwave to send with a child going on a sleepover at someone else s house or to leave with grandparents as an easy treat to give gluten free grandchildren
positive,14/8/21,i was a little nervous about this product when it was first introduced to me at a support group meeting i wasn t sure how any gf product cooked in the microwave could be edible but it was delicious i now try to keep some on hand for when traveling so i have a food option when the rest of the family is taking advantage of the hotel breakfast since almost everywhere has a microwave they ll let me use
positive,21/4/21,what is better than caffeine and sugar this product blends great coffee sugar and cream to produce a little cup of paradise
positive,1/4/21,to see all the one star reviews is quite surprising mixed with water this stuff tastes great i m not sure what some reviewers are expecting but it does taste like a good glass of kool aid who doesn t like kool aid anyway it s main source that will keep you alert is the green tea extract which is pretty much caffeine but it s a smooth transition somehow not like drinking coffee or soda anyway not bad at all if you need a little pick me up got lots of vitamins in there too
positive,17/4/21,really good i like it and i would drink this before or after a workout or run my son who runs also thought it was really good my other son did not like it too much i can taste the pomegranate the son that liked it gave it double thumbs up i think it s light enough for an every day drink before working out it has lots of vitamins and good stuff for you not so sure about that but i am sure it tastes good
positive,10/3/21,i m new to green tea but i wanted to give these a shot after i got my senseo machine i was pleasently surprised with the taste it is very smooth with a light taste of lemon these aren t made for the senseo machine but they work just as well
positive,22/4/21,excellent and with a hint of lemon connoisseurs will like these small sardines tightly packed like sardines of course in pure olive oil
positive,25/4/21,i love these k cups they have a nice tea taste they are cheaper than other places i love them cold too
positive,1/4/21,this tea tastes even better with some milk and honey by itself it s better than average
positive,30/6/21,wow this stuff tastes great it has a variety of uses and i am sure i will continue to find more
positive,1/3/21,these are very flavorful fruit snacks my kids and i prefer them to others that have many more unhealthy ingredients they are pricey but anything that says organic tends to be
positive,29/1/21,these cherries arrived promptly taste great and were completely as advertised we broke the package down into smaller quantities and froze them would buy again and will when the need arises
positive,17/4/21,these are very good and a bargain depending on whether they are on sale came packed well i don t taste the oil that other reviewers mentioned a great snack or addition to salads
positive,10/3/21,i was a little concerned about ordering such a large quantity but the price was good and the reviews were good i am happy that i did buy the cherries so good for snacking and adding to yogurt and on cereal i have not used them yet in baking but plan to make some muffins with adding the cherries to the batter taste for me is the right balance between tart and sweet after opening i put the cerries in zip lock bags and placed them in the refrigerator the cherries are fresh
positive,30/5/21,these are really tasty and not too sweet we ordered another box great in oatmeal they are somewhat oily but this is not a problem just a surprise compared to something like raisins
positive,28/9/21,it s my regular cereal now cinnamon is a strong spice so yes it dominates too sweet based on the amount of carbs in a serving its higher than some by two or three grams but with the amount of fiber including four grams of soluble the net carbs is reduced only knock here i wish it was available through the auto delivery service as this price appears to be way too high its about in the local store for one box
positive,6/5/21,my dog loves them and we received them very quickly i highly recommend this product especially to owners with dogs who love to chew
positive,20/4/21,these are good chips i like the texture and that they are easier to chew than regular tortilla chips especially good with some salsa
positive,20/4/21,these chips are a family favorite i have a large family and we all love them similar to a healthy version of doritos a little more texture and great taste highly recommended
positive,21/4/21,i love them they go really well with soups salads etc i just wish that they don t come broken up so much
positive,2/5/21,this is just another in a long line of terrific yogi teas i usually keep a teapot full of this tea and add it to my orange juice based smoothie in the morning it adds a nice hint of mint i recently read that adding a citrus juice to green tea multiplies the benefits of the antioxidants in the tea this tea goes very well with orange juice
positive,18/12/19,this is truly a great versatile mix substituting oil for butter and rice milk for regular milk works out perfect using orange juice for the milk makes great pancakes and muffins as well the options are endless for muffins our favorite is adding a bit of cinnamon and gfcf chocolate chips i also sneak in small amounts of light colored pureed veggies baby food
positive,19/1/20,i have tried alot of jasmine teas and by far this is the best i have tried everyone i share this with agrees
positive,31/3/20,i have kids and we love this product even friends who come over request it it is really yummy
positive,18/12/19,love the texture and lightness the flavor has a hint of nuts although does not have listed my family loves them
positive,13/10/19,these are tasty great strawberry flavor nice and crisp and only calories i buy these on the subscription plan to save even more money i even ship these to my daughters
positive,28/9/20,these bars are light and very tasty worth trying and i think you will like them even though i like them the price and small size of the bars will stop me from future purchases
positive,16/11/20,my dog ace loves these treats i love them because i can throw a handful in my pocket to take along on one of ace s walks without them staining or making my pocket sticky the coating on the treats is great for those of us that don t want to bother with plastic baggies my dog learned most of his tricks using these treats as a reward
positive,27/2/20,as my box arrived earlier today i cannot attest to it s health benefits i m not sure if i would be able to anyway but i can absolutely confirm that there is no taste
positive,26/2/21,i was not expecting much from this a disposable package of self boiling pasta with a bag of meat sauce there should be no way it can work but it does you fill cover the slightly oily pasta with water leave on the drainer top microwave it for minutes drain it heat the sauce and mix it all up and amazingly it tasted good normally i can t stand this zero effort lazy style of cooking microwaved meals but this was actually really tasty i would not make this a part of my regular routine because of the price but i can imagine people who would i have to take issue with the packaging though i am giving this four stars because each serving is individually packaged and none of it is recycleable the bulk of what you are buying is packaging and it all gets thrown away
positive,18/12/19,i am a fan of healthy choice products and this one is good too i ve generally used their frozen food options but liked the idea of a shelf storable healthy option for lunch this pack contains everything needed for a quick and healthy pasta lunch the directions are clear and easy to follow the straining device that drains excess water after microwaving the pasta works well and the pasta sauce packet contains a sufficient amount of sauce for the pasta this mixer takes a little more time and effort that a frozen option due to having the microwave the pasta drain it and add the sauce however the trade off of more time for preparation is outweighed by having an option that can be stored on a shelf or in a desk drawer a nice option for work or on the go
positive,19/1/20,my family loves maple syrup on pancakes and by far this is one of the best we have tasted we love it
positive,10/7/20,if you like graham crackers and you like oats and honey then you will love this product just the right amount of each makes this a real treat to eat i only wish it had less sodium mg apart from that the lack of trans fat and saturated fat makes this a healthy choice for graham cracker lovers i would buy this whole grain product again
positive,14/4/21,i ate the graham crackers and they were delicious i shared the graham crackers with lana and she said also that the graham crackers were delicious both lana and i agreed on the strong oats taste and a lingering graham cracker taste less subtle than other graham crackers i asked lana if this was a cracker she would use for the crust of a banana cream or key lime pie with no hesitation she said yes this is a wonderful alternative snack to cookies and chips lana is with me in highly recommending back to nature golden honey oat grahams
positive,24/4/21,these are some very tasty and sweet crackers they are a bit hard not overly processed like some of the big brand crackers you find in the grocery store they are very tasty and and make a great snack i have not had a chance to make smoores with them but i suspect they will be great for that too they are well formed and don t crumble apart easily so they are very versatile
positive,28/4/21,these are very good premium graham crackers delicious what else can i say it is as good as a graham cracker can get which is to say good but not that great they are a bit pricey about more than a regular graham cracker is it worth it who knows how much do you love graham crackers if you love graham crackers or have lots of money to burn sure go for it
positive,12/7/21,these graham crackers are everything you d want and expect of an all natural graham cracker they taste great with and fit right in with our family who go through a box a graham crackers on any given week these weren t quite as tough as our usual brand of grahams with a few more broken crackers and they definitely don t stay fresh up as on the counter if you forget to seal up the zip lock i think both of these are a result of the lack of random binders and preservatives from other brands and i don t think they really detract from the product at all they are great crackers and worth the space in the pantry
positive,18/12/19,i liked these a lot they had just a touch of sweetness not too much and are a great afternoon or late night snack i was pleasantly surprised that something that is supposed to be good for you tastes this good the only reason i gave them four stars instead of five was because the packaging left something to be desired it was hard to open the inside package without throwing crackers everywhere and they don t seal back up for freshness i put mine in a ziplock bag though and they stayed fresh that way try them you ll like them
positive,19/1/20,these crackers are delicious and healthy my month old daughter eats them equally as well as the popular graham cracker brand i will definitely buy these again
positive,28/4/21,for being a natural and relatively healthy food item i m impressed by how good these crackers actually taste they re not as sweet as a standard graham cracker but again very good for what they are i top them with natural peanut butter and eat them with a glass of milk yum
positive,8/8/20,i purchased this when it was about for the pack found the deal on great deal don t think it s worth over however pretty expensive at it s normal price this was my first time trying this brand probably one of the best instant soup products i ve tasted this isn t loaded with salts like most others and it taste healthy my only gripe is the amount of plastic and waste caused by this product here s the ingredients nutritional info if anyone is wondering ingredients noodles wheat flour water tapioca starch vegan lactic acid salt soup soybean paste water soybean rice salt sugar rice wine sea vegetable yeast extract onion shiitake mushroom toppings dehydrated tofu dehydrated green onion dehydrated spinach allergy note labeled as being processed on equipment that may contain traces of peanuts nutritional information serving size bowl calories carbohydrates g fat g sodium mg sugars g fiber lt g protein g vitamin a vitamin c calcium iron
positive,22/5/21,we tend to eat these straight and or with hummus as a chip substitute i ve noticed some variation between packages in the texture of the crisps i prefer them when they re a bit firmer but they re still nice even when they re softer than i would like
positive,18/12/19,i love these tasty snacks they have a great crunch and just the right amount of salt i am not sure i would call these a health food because of the fat content but they are really good tasting and i will be ordering again
positive,19/1/20,these are great i m not a huge fan of vegetables but i ll snack on these
positive,3/8/20,this is an awesome tasting snack the cheapest place near us is trader joe s and they sell it for amazon is even cheaper you cannot just eat one we finish the whole bag each time we open it
positive,29/7/21,great love these and happy that can be found on line would love if you carry the snak size bags because i open a bag i tend to eat all and the snak bags are better for portion control
positive,8/7/20,i really like virginia diner unsalted peanuts so i decided to give this flavor a try the name old bay refers to the seasoning of the same name normally associated with seafood so if you are familiar with that seasoning you have an idea what to expect it s nothing like a bay leaf if you ve ever had nabisco s doo dads snack mix then these peanuts will be familiar to you they taste almost just like the peanuts in the mix and if you wanted to make your own chex party mix these nuts would be perfect like all virginia diner products the nuts come with a foil seal which is tightly depressed because the contents are vacuum packed when you break the seal you will hear the air rush in this type of packaging helps insure the nuts are fresh and crunchy and they were the nuts are small and mostly in halves there are a few fragments but not many
positive,13/4/21,i ve always loved mochi but can t find it in little rock and didn t want to go through the trouble of making my own this arrived quickly and in good condition it tastes fresh and soft not stale at all if you like mochi you won t be dissapointed
positive,20/2/21,very delicious taste was stars ingredients why i dropped one star added sugar but still i would recommend this product
positive,9/12/20,i debated a while before ordering these because they are kind of fragile but my shipment had no problems ha maybe i d trust amazon and ups more than the people they ve got working down at the grocery store another reason i debated ordering was of course the salt and of course being saltines there s a bunch of it i haven t compared a lot of other snacks but strangely enough these have less salt that other alternatives i guess because there s no other tastes that they have to mask the little bit of salt the do have comes right on through i don t normally worry about such things as health and nutrition but boxes is a lot and i tend to chow down on a lot of them because they re so good plenty of time left on the expiration date months from now so that s not a worry prices as with everything fluctuate but i got a good deal
positive,1/4/21,i love this cereal i first had it at my sisters and now i am hooked i love the fact that it has good grains and that it is organic so this seems a good cereal as cereals go i love the taste a little sweet and crunch and the price at a box is really good
positive,25/2/21,this is a pleasantly vanilla tinged breakfast cereal organic and gluten free at about per oz box it may not be for everyone but for those who need to worry about gluten this cereal is definitely not a trade off on taste i like the texture too with a satisfying crunchiness that s filling i definitely recommend giving this a try
positive,18/12/19,i tried nature s path crunchy vanilla sunrise courtesy of amazon vine and really enjoyed it there s lot of variety in the cereal with all sorts of granola and cereal type pieces i m not skilled enough at forensic cerealogy to identify all of them but i do know enough to say that they all tasted great this is a great breakfast treat and it even works as a snack if you are so inclined
positive,19/1/20,i had problems with the order but i am writing this review just about the coffee we buy this coffee so that every friday at work i can make a special pot of flavor my co workers really seem to enjoy the fun flavors of this brand especially the chocolate ones we will continue to purchase this brand in the future

positive,5/6/21,even though the price is always fluctuating it s always been less than i would pay at a grocery store even when that store has a sale in my opinion de cecco makes the best pastas on the market today and penne is my favorite because it s versatile working well in many dishes and because it s easier to make sure it stays al dente i don t think i ve ever cooked it so long that it went to mush though i suppose if you really tried you could do it for many years i fell back on spaghetti noodles but then switched to penne never to look back i even use it for a less conventional noodles salad with mayo with a touch of milk stirred in and shredded sharp cheddar cheese and a dusting of fresh or canned parsley or basil thrown in with the subscribe and save ordering you can save another and you ll always have this stable on your pantry shelves
positive,25/7/21,i found this stuff at a big box retailer not too long ago and gave it a try i was happy to find it here at a better price than the individual serving at the store it is a great drink to grab as i m running to catch my carpool in the morning it tides me over until i eat breakfast at work i love chocolate coconut water and this is great because of the caffeine kick of the coffee
positive,13/7/21,all the wylers singles to go are great they taste good and mix easily in bottled water most places are overcharging for this item walgreen s sells a package of for or less it was a package of over memorial day most of my boxes had printing on the box indicating per box i see some places charging over per box at that rate you can buy a ounce can of soda even big brands when they are on special and you get the can and the water included so why spend that much just for the powder
positive,9/7/21,i tried this for the first time and i loved it nice bold taste smooth the price was excellent considering what i have been paying elsewhere i intend to purchase this again if it is still available and would recommend it to people who prefer strong bold taste
positive,8/7/21,i eat lentils at least once a week if not more and these are the best i ve ever had typically i just buy the pound bag of goya or store brand lentils which are serviceable but every once in a while i ll order these from amazon they really have much more taste than the generic pound bag of lentils they take longer to cook but are definitely worth it highly recommended
positive,15/7/21,as will all of bob s red mill products these are excellent the cost in buying in bulk from amazon is much lower than the cost at our local coop and i like this produce better does not really require any soaking before cooking

positive,17/6/21,although a bit too sweet i like the texture and the amount of choclately goodness in each bite i do wish the brownie was a bit larger but i like the automatic portion control and the fact that they make a convenient snack for work or school usually amazon has great prices on food items but in this case they are half the price at your local costco where i was told by an associate there that they fly off the shelf
positive,31/8/21,i was a little bit hesitant to order this many boxes of potato dumplings without knowing the brand it turns out that the taste and texture is very similar to the brand names excellent for an off brand the price is too high but altogether a great product for those who miss their knoedel on the plate next to the roast and gravy
positive,7/8/21,i bought this stuff to take camping to use in recipes and in coffee teas i spent two weeks in the woods and was really glad i bought this item it works great and as far as i know there s nothing weird in it unlike most powdered coffee creamers it does take a little longer to completely mix in but it s way better note that this is not a milk substitute it is a superb cream replacement
positive,6/9/21,i really like this jerky the plain jane is really good but so is the ginger flavor i m eyeballing the el diablo right now ah yes the hot stuff my favorite this jerky isn t dry like some its moist without being heavy so its a great deal as far as price per pound

positive,29/8/19,this chili is pretty tasty but only a little spicy it s easy to take with you there are two good size servings per container each serving is calories with grams of fat grams of carbs and grams of protein i ve only eaten it as is but i think it would be great on nachos or chili dogs

positive,17/12/20,i found these at bj s wholesale club and really liked the taste they are very crunchy and chocolaty and the portion size is good
positive,2/5/20,description lightly roasted and lightly salted with no added oil size oz bags evaluation excellent and flavorful however some are under roasted and not crunchy a few nuts taste stale blue diamond brand almonds moderately roasted with canola safflower or sunflower oil and lightly salted are more flavorful although not oily the roasting oil does effect the flavor whether that s a good thing or not is a matter of individual tastes the longer or more intense roasting makes the nuts crunchier price comparison at the time of this writing both back to nature and blue diamond almonds are about cents oz blue diamond almonds roasted salted ounce tins pack of the blue diamond almonds come in more convenient oz cans but may be less environmental freindly

positive,9/5/20,you ll either like this double salted licorice and indeed other salted licorice available on amazon or you ll detest it the reviews on this and other licorice products attest to this polarity among reviewers it s an acquired taste that once acquired proves to be somewhat addictive i have only recently become acquainted with salted licorice i actually prefer the normal salted variety although the salty kick from ammonium salts rather that sodium chloride is very strong and strangely satisfying in these double salt rounds i would advise anybody who is thinking of trying salted licorice to seek out a small pack of the stuff first of all if you like it go ahead and order one of the regular salted kraepelien holm farm salt licorice pound bags pack of available on amazon making sure to take advantage of the subscription offer otherwise you risk wasting your money on something you may consider inedible

positive,19/10/20,the sticky rice is perfect just microwave it in the container it comes in for min the paper thin wraps are very small and it is a bit difficult to roll the result is a bit of a mess but tastes great i put a small amount of crab meat next to the rice each pack comes with wraps a container of rice and one soy sauce pack the calorie count is but with it is a reasonable and is enough for a lunch i bought it when it was a gold box item for it is worth that but i will not purchase again for a higher price overall it is easy to make tastes great and is a great option to have around since it does not require any refrigeration
positive,1/3/20,i was hesitant to purchase this despite the outstanding reviews because of the price i mean what could be cheaper than rice and toasted seaweed with that perspective i was very pleased with these meals snacks the rice was more delicious than the freshly made white rice served in many places possibly even better than the rice in my house and the wraps are super delicate and with a nice lightly crispy texture that is most enjoyable if you like sushi wraps and rice i highly recommend you try these
positive,28/7/20,these soda s taste great while i ve never had the original flavored i expect it to taste something like a sprite unlike american soda s like coke and dr pepper these are fruit flavored and have far less sugar and sodium in them making them a much healthier choice of beverage as healthy as a soda could possibly be that is all flavors taste great and the bottle is recyclable i d recommend them to anyone
positive,7/3/20,looking for a delicious crunchy snack that won t go straight to your waistline these paper thin beautifully seasoned crackers hold up perfectly on their own and to any all of your favorite toppings hummus cheese hard and spreadable vegetable wafers cucumbers zucchini roasted peppers etc chip dips salsa i could go on forever at calories for crackers calories from fat these wonderful wafers will satisfy any snack attack and you ll feel great about eating them i initially found these in a health food store but amazon sells and ships them for cheaper money quality was as good or better well that s what i think oh and yum

positive,22/3/18,this wildrice mix tasted just a mite too hard after cooking but if you left it for very long it got mooshy so the timing is critical once the timing is down the rice comes out perfect no more then minutes and has pure natural non chemical taste very wholesome and the blend is a nice mix of flavor
positive,12/3/18,i ve found this to be a good sweetener i have to use more than they say about drops when i m using lemon but i use extra packet sweetener too very happy i ll just have to figure out how many servings i get from a bottle but i m guessing it s more economical than the stevia products i get at the grocery store

positive,8/9/20,i am really thrilled with this product i wanted to be able to make oatmeal in my slow cooker so that it was warm and ready in the morning with no hassles i have done so in the past with old fashioned rolled oats and the outcome was always less than satisfactory no matter what adjustments i made to the water oats ratio this attempt turned out perfectly the very first time which most likely has to do with the cut of the grain the ratio is cup oats to cups water on low for hours and cup of dried fruit i added about cup of quinoa and a total of cups dried fruit craisins tart cherries and goji berries and good sized diced braeburn apple no sugars i didn t use the spray pam product it tells you to put in the crock but coated it with organic coconut oil which is solid at room temperature it was amazing no sweetening needed to enhance the flavors my husband eats oatmeal every day and he really liked it too

positive,9/3/18,in the past i just didn t use tomato paste very often that s because most brands are just nasty we d always have a can of hunt s or contadina around but i d always be disappointed whenever i used them it s really annoying to say make homemade enchilada sauce have it taste mediocre and then add insult to injury by having to throw away half a can of leftover tomato paste amore by contrast actually keeps the bright tomato flavor since it s in tubes there s none of the tinny taste so common to canned foods and it s so easy to squeeze out a small amount that i use it all the time there are all sorts of soups and sauces that can benefit from a little tomato flavor but which don t justify opening a whole can of paste not to mention the fact that most canned pastes would make the food taste worse not better there are only two mysteries about this product for me first a tablespoon serving has grams of fat no other tomato pastes i looked at contain fat since the ingredients are only tomato paste and salt i have to wonder where this fat comes from the second mystery is that they label the box as double concentrated as far as i can tell it s no more concentrated than any other tomato paste i still have to use exactly the same amount in a recipe it just tastes better than the other brands but i ll forgive amore the mysterious fat and exaggerated labeling this has become a cooking essential in my kitchen
positive,18/5/18,i recently began using wholesome sweeteners products and could not be happier with the taste i was so happy to discover this product and will continue using it for sure
positive,27/1/19,tastes just like regular black tea only a little weaker don t get it if you expect it to actually taste like raspberries i bought boxes to use in the first half of my menstrual cycle for building a good uterine lining it s organic good tasting and has health benefits without the caffeine can t go wrong
positive,10/11/19,i bought this tea to help my pregnancy i think it may be helping i am hoping but it does taste very good i like it and would buy it again and recommend this product to friends
positive,8/11/19,i really like black tea and this is a great taste substitute while pregnant i had to brew it stronger than recommended but it s great
positive,25/10/21,bought this food after reading others reviews for my schnauzer who suffers from pancreatitis it really did the trick for him since being on this food he hasn t had one day of trouble a great food
positive,8/5/20,i have been eating medifast meals for a year medifast changed the recipe to their pretzels and they were not as good to my surprise the cinnamon pretzel that kay s is a good if not better than medifast and cost have the price the calories and protein were important factor and are pretty much the same based on ounces
positive,28/9/18,this is my husband s favorite soda has a mild fruity flavor similar to manzanita sol tastes like a little bit of heaven i can t find any stores in my area that sell it but i have had good experiences buying it off amazon just remember when you are buying to pay attention to the shipping weight as some of the distributors use a mass picture of a pack but will actually be selling a litre shipping weight for a pack should be around lbs oh and guarana comes in many flavors but guarana antarctica is usually the most popular favorite
positive,29/7/19,i thought this a nice evenly tasting coffee with no bitterness or after taste i enjoy it and will buy more in the future
positive,9/3/18,this has perfect balance of sweetness nutrients its a great breakfast item i love it i will but it again from amazon com
positive,18/5/18,this was handy when i couldn t get to a store and wanted some for the coming week rd day it was here not bad price but looking for better price but this was good stuff
positive,17/5/20,most of the reviews are mostly negative but if your brand new to this candy its sooo delicious if you like a chewy hardness feeling like your jaw is going to fall off this is the stuff i m and never heard of this candy before but i tried it once at a world market and couldn t stop eating them there so addicting they have a great mouth watering taste to them i would recommend this candy to new comers
positive,24/2/20,it s a tasty tea handy packets to keep at work local store stopped carrying it and the amazon case is a decent price
positive,3/5/19,quick shipping well packed i loved these they were for a party everyone enjoyed them true melon flavor not sticky really good thank you
positive,27/3/20,for some reason our local stores stopped stocking this product my wife and i love the taste we used amonzon com to provide it excellent taste
positive,31/12/20,previous reviews have been negative on the taste of this water but to me it has less taste than some common brands dasani aquafina of water in that sense i like it more i can t stand the slightly bitter metallic taste of those waters this one tastes more like water on the other hand this is advertised for having the correct ph level and as being electrolyte infused but i have noticed nothing special about it in terms of how it impacts my workouts it s wet just like any other water so in this facet i rate it as being less than advertised
positive,13/1/20,has a smooth taste like it claims without any unpleasant metallic flavor hydrates well although i think it is rather expensive and i personally didn t notice it hydrating any better than arrowhead water which is what i normally drink if however you have already discovered that high ph water helps you more than other types this water tastes good and would be a good choice
positive,21/9/20,a certainly refreshing bottle of water and a very large one at that the taste is very pleasing without the plastic from the bottle taste to taint it it seems a bit pricey though giving you extra benefits might just be worth the purchase
positive,2/12/20,this water taste great we love the bottle perfect water for everyone i love that it is liters because i am trying to drink more water you will love this water
positive,20/11/19,i am very picky about my water i moved to florida at the age of and i quickly realized that i could not drink the tap water i can actually taste the difference at restaurants when they serve tap water versus purified or bottled water essentia ph drinking water is the best water i have ever tasted it tastes completely clear and delicious i only received a liter bottle so i did not notice any of the medical benefits of the ph water i do have gerd but didn t notice a difference with drinking the liters of water over days the price is a little steep on this water but i would consider buying more for the taste and to see if it really helps my gerd
positive,2/12/20,i admit i have a hard time identifying differences in most bottled water unless they have some funky aftertaste but this water is different it tastes exceptionally clean and crisp no chemical tastes no salty taste just very refreshing water i like the large size of the bottles as carrying one of these as i go out would guarantee i meet my water quota for the day i poured some for my five year old granddaughter and she said you have good water at your house granny so i guess there is a difference when it s good it s good
positive,11/12/19,i m not smart enough to know enough about bottled water i m in the camp who believes that naturally filtered well water is the best most bottled water strips the natural minerals out however there is somethign to be said about water being too acidic a higher ph would be the opposite so in that regard this should make this water much better honestly i cannot tell the difference but i can say ther was no odor there was no bad aftertaste but i cannot say if this is worth the price
positive,20/11/19,this is one of the best tasting waters that i ve tried it is just purified water and not spring water but it has such a pure tasting taste to it it is enhanced with minerals and honestly i can taste the mineral taste which i like funny that a good tasting water is different from most drinks that we consume water is one that we want without any taste or flavor just pure fresh wet and clean essentia is one without any noticeable flavors but the mineral taste i really liked it and gave it to my family too they were surprised with a yum which isn t really a reaction that i normally get from water it has ph factor and infused with electrolytes can t really tell those things from drinking it but good to know recommending completely on taste it s excellent tasting water
positive,28/6/20,the first thing i look for in a water is the aftertaste some of them have a metallic nasty taste that i can not stand but this one is very refreshing cool clear and fresh definately would buy again
positive,8/8/20,i think the essentia drinking water tastes very good there are a couple popular brands of bottled water that i think taste funny the essentia is very good and crisp i can t say much about the actual ph level because i did not test it however i didn t seem to have as many issues with my acid relux on the days when i drank the essentia it s awkward carrying the liter bottle around but i did actually find it helpful i take it to work in the morning and make myself drink it until it s gone before i allow myself to have something good meaning bad for me therefore i do get a much larger water intake during the day at the office than i normally would so i love the taste and the size of the bottle but it can get expensive i will probably keep some on hand especially when my acid reflux is really acting up and the prilosec isn t helping but i m not sure if i could really afford to buy it to have every single day
positive,14/7/21,tastes like good odorless fresh clean water i like the fact the water is electrolyte infused the bottle is a very generous size but easy to grip and hold
positive,2/12/20,what else can i say other than this drinking water tastes great the bottle is quite large at liter it s almost the size of a liter bottle of soda
positive,20/11/19,i m on auto and i love my water just wish it was a little bit cheaper or if they give discounts or free pack with orders it would make thing a bit easier i will continue to get my essentia as long as i am able to the water does have a lot of wonderful advantages i have fluid build up in my legs and sometimes my lungs because of my heart i had kidney failure this water has helped me to be well hydrated and to keep my kidneys in working order the water goes directly where it is needed
positive,1/3/21,for me some bottle water is better than others this bottled water was very good it had a good clean taste which is always important especially for those who do not enjoy drinking water the bottle was also thick enough to withstand being dropped but not so thick that you are really just paying for the bottle overall i would buy this bottled water again
positive,5/5/21,a little expensive considering its maxwell house but its better than starbucks fresh and i will buy again for cup person its ideal
positive,2/12/20,our family loves these cornuts delicious fresh and crunchy we remember them from when we were kids and still can t get enough we like all the flavors but our favorite is still the original after much research this company offers the best price
positive,20/11/19,ordered this because of some minor stomach issues certainly hasn t hurt but not sure it has all the healing powers others claim but only time will tell a few things this honey tastes great just about like regular honey so don t be afraid to order it thinking you can t handle the taste it has the consistency of a honey butter spread and is great right out of the jar or on toast bottom line probably more expensive than regular honey but if you have some digestive issues worth trying as it is a good tasting product
positive,9/10/21,this is my first manuka honey and i must say that it tastes very nice toast a slice of bread e g arnold s ancient grains spread honey spread peanut butter enjoy
positive,12/2/21,this is definitely different than any other raw honey i ve tried and its fantastic with three small kids i can t afford to be sick and a few spoonfuls of this stuff a day helps soothe a sore throat when i m dealing with an innless or scratchy throat from allergies and i could swear it also boosts my mood and energy it also seems to help digestive problems i started taking a tablespoon a day preventatively and was pleasantly surprised to be the only member of my family not laid low by a heinous stomach bug that swept through our home i also love that this stuff doesn t have to be chiseled out of the jar like some raw honey totally with the money and this is the cheapest place to get it that i have found my local whole foods charges almost double for the stuff
positive,2/12/20,just tried this for the first time yesterday it could ve fooled me that it wasn t coffee i think it actually tastes better than coffee the hazelnut flavor is great better for you and no caffiene reactions
positive,20/11/19,for a serving of full flavored and nutritious split pea soap that involves only boiling and pouring water nothing can beat dr mcdougall s split pea soup with barley this is the best instant soup that is on the market
positive,25/6/21,i have tried pretty much all flavors and it is great i take it for lunch daily it s quikly to preper it is under cal per meal you save a lot of money and time do not leaving the office to a restaurant to eat and is guilty free bcuz is vegan to me is a great solution for my lunch time on weekdays where i had daily look for a place to eat where i could get something vegetarian safe under and healthy you will see how much money you save do not eating at a restaurant bringing you own snaks and lunch from home
positive,17/3/20,excellent price considering what the local coffe shop charges for chai this is the best chai tea mix i ve ever tasted and the best value i ve found
positive,21/7/20,my geriatric bouvier des flandres is years old and becoming increasingly finicky with his eating this product not only is palatable but has encouraged him to eat again it is also low in fat which is what he needs due to a history of pancreatitis
positive,22/2/21,i use this syrup on pancakes and to make homemade granola it is great tasting with lots of maple flavor i love the spill resistant spout good value instead of going to the grocery store for pure maple syrup
positive,8/6/21,this is a great product great taste and texture i will definitely purchase more
positive,2/12/20,what can i say i just ordered another flavor from the same company every one in my office comments on the rich smell and having a cup in the morning is something i look forward to if you like flavored coffee you will like this one
positive,20/11/19,for gluten free they are pretty good they are a bit dry but that seems to be a problem with gluten free in general i like the simplebites line but i wish there were more varieties
positive,25/1/21,i wanted these for a crust for pumpkin cheesecake but they didn t quite make it in time no matter we enjoyed them right out of the box they are packed full of flavor the big question as with all gf baked goods is texture these cookies are excellent very crunchy without being at all crumbly or sandy if you ve ever enjoyed ppefferneuse these will take you there they are exactly like that right down to the possibility of a cracked tooth and that s not a negative it s part of the charm really they re good cookies with outstanding ginger flavor mom says these are every bit as good as the ppefferneuse she made for christmas every year and that s high praise
positive,1/7/21,i love pamela s products and amazon is a great place to get a good prices i like these ginger snaps because they aren t too gingery they re just right
positive,30/9/20,this is the best pre packaged wasabi i have found it has a great texture too i only buy this now that a friend recommended it and i tried it wa
positive,15/3/20,i bought a case of these noodles and was impressed with the quality it is greenish in color and has a hint of spinach taste to it that i really liked it is hearty and fills you up in summary i really liked it and would buy it again
positive,6/7/21,can you say sugar high lol that was the point in ordering a case i sent it to my husband who s deployed overseas he loves them
positive,29/6/21,this tea has a nice flavor although it is hard to say if it is actually increasing my joint comfort the power of placebo can be just as powerful if not more so than any herb or medicine out there
positive,26/7/21,i love horizon organic products and accidentally stumbled across these in starbucks i had a gift card and instead of leaving a just little on it i purchased a horizon organic chocolate milk along with my coffee i thought i better go straight home so i can put this in the fridge for later wrong i was so happy that they don t have to be refrigerated then i was even happier when i tasted it soooo good now when i have a chocolate craving after dinner i reach for one of these instead of a candy bar yes they re still calories but i feel better about having one of these than candy cookies or ice cream they are a bit expensive but with amazon s current sale and shopping around locally i ve found them for an ok price i also emailed horizon organic and they re sending me coupons i don t know for how much off
positive,21/10/21,i like the taste of this chocolate milk it s not too sweet and the size is perfect to take to work and have it as my breakfast new the design of this container is terrible for toddlers opening from the top fits the straw perfectly but this is bad when my daughter drinks it she would try really hard to suck on the straw when the air is gone and container is flat she would squeese it trying to get more milk
positive,25/10/21,i have purchased these in the past from other websites and love them i was excited to find such a deal on the price per bag by purchasing the case through amazon although that is a lot of chips i ordered one plain and one spicy the plain were delicious and fresh the spicy were stale so now i have a case of stale chips and a case of fresh chips thus the gamble with ordering in quantity i suppose the chips themselves are wonderful nutty and a much healthier and lower carb higher fiber alternative to tortilla chips i eat them plain with salsa or make nachos with them we even crumble them over taco salad
positive,29/6/21,this is a nutritious and tasty way to add seasoning to grains veggies etc that s not loaded with salt and other preservatives
positive,5/7/21,these have a great taste and are very crispy just cheese so they are good if you are trying to go low carb or are gluten free the only problem i had was they are expensive
positive,17/9/21,haven t gotten a box of yogi tea i didn t like and this one is no different it s more of an herbal infusion with green tea so it might not be as tea y as one might expect but if you re unsure if you want to commit to a whole case of the stuff i d buy a box at the store and test it out because a case is a huge price savings in my ct area of about about a box but it s an expensive loss if it turns out you don t like it hopeful for good results i m getting married in four months and am using this as a part of a healthier skin routine
positive,18/8/21,i think these taste better than other non gluten cakes perhaps it is the ingredients you need to add to the mix cup butter softened cup buttermilk large eggs t vanilla and t almond extract you can make chocolate cake by adding c cocoa to dry cake mix and increasing the buttermilk to cups one box makes two cakes or muffin cupcakes mix is cheaper here than at albertsons and whole foods hodgson mill batch tests using an elisa gluten assay test all natural gluten free ingredients that are both additive and preservative free
positive,31/7/21,if you like coffee with overtones of nuts and are fond of pecans you need to try this coffee mrs bryants southern pecan organic coffee is a real treat with a genuine pecan flavoring try some with a slice of you favorite pecan pie
positive,18/10/21,lurpak is far better than any other butter out there be glad you can buy it in the usa creamy tasty and just plain good

positive,24/8/21,i bought this on a fri sale at cents a kcup it was a nice deal and it s definitely one of the better green mountain flavors
positive,24/6/21,really quenches your thirst but you need to like seltzer water i do top of the line
positive,27/9/21,not exactly perfect for extreme low carb dieting but still good enough compared to your average sugar infused muffin mix flavor is pretty good though the muffins are lacking something to round them off but they are moist and have a good texture
positive,29/6/21,immediately after placing my order i received an email from the seller with care instructions and specifics on the shipping of the bamboo when it arrived exactly when i was expecting it it was in superb shape i could tell not only by looking at it but also by the smell it was such a nice treat to open the package and be greeted with that fresh sweet smell not only was the quality of the bamboo superb but it was such a great price i would absolutely recommend this seller and their products
positive,29/6/21,i have run into nonni s at the homes of various friends and never thought to try and get some for myself they are the perfect complement to my morning cup of coffee and give me a little pick me up without loading me up first thing in the morning delicious buy some
positive,11/9/21,have never been a big meat eater but cut back even more a few months ago i began supplementing my diet with more beans legumes but was not feeling nutritionally satisfied and realized i was not getting enough protein did a little research and discovered that hemp was ideal for meeting protein requirements and according several articles i read it has many other nutritional and health benefits as well i purchased the nutiva hemp protein powder in conjunction with the better than milk rice to avoid over use of soy according to directions for both products i mix tablespoons hemp protein and tablespoons of btm in water it mixes easily in a regular plastic shaker and i don t even have to use the de clumping attachment that fits inside the shaker it s just shake n go this combination has been the perfect way to start my day i was concerned about the taste as some reviews i have read rated the taste of hemp very low i can t speak for other brands but the finely ground nutiva hemp powder has a mild nutty flavor and i love it from what i ve read hemp does not contain oligosaccharides which commonly causes gastric distress with soy proteins and i have not experienced any bloating with the hemp and rice milk combo i am happy to start my day with something both nutritious and delicious and thank goodness i don t have to use the electric blender one less thing to wash also the amazon price on the nutiva hemp protein and the better than milk rice can t be beat and both qualify for free shipping fantastic
positive,12/8/21,i did not expect this to taste very good i was surprised that it was great i will be ordering this item in the future it also arrived very quickly
positive,31/7/20,a fantastic buy totally worth it i am done itch buying tose little packages you re just paying of packaging there this yeast is fantastic i e put it in a plastic container after i opened it and leave it the refrigerator also whenever a recipe calls for instant yeast i just add more yeast to the recipe and it turns out perfect
positive,13/6/20,this tea tastes wonderful by itself with a little honey or stevia if you are counting calories or carbs for a real treat mix it with a little peppermint tea bigelow makes a morroccan mint that is really great for this particular mix but it is not available on amazon yet
positive,31/7/20,bigelows only red tea so far is pear the flavor is excellent no caffeine and its organic the pear flavor is light and does not taste artificial because its not i have about red teas that i drink regularly because it so low in tannins and does not aggravate my illness bigelows asian pear is one of my favorites
positive,13/6/20,the taste reminds me of maple syrup it s very tasty when used in cereal or on pancakes but it s also a perfect sweetener for my tea and it doesn t change the flavor of my tea when i use it i don t use honey nor do i like the taste and this does not taste anything like honey to me
positive,26/9/20,i don t eat stuff like this very often but when i m in the mood it s nice to know i have an alternative that isn t quite as bad as the original it s handy enough to throw in my purse and take to the movie theater and a much better option than the popcorn there i wouldn t recommend making a steady diet of the stuff after all it is essentially all refined carbs but for that occasional treat this would certainly be a better choice than other alternatives and the taste is fantastic
positive,17/10/20,these are some awfully tasty donuts they consist of a fairly dense golden cake coated in chocolate they re small but rather dense and rich they re always moist probably because of some additive but it s the additives that make them tasty this is something i can only stand to eat every so often but on occasion they are really delicious
positive,14/12/20,i like this hot cocoa mix a lot the taste is better than what you usually get at the office or grocery store which shouldn t come as a surprise for a ghirardelli product it s a bit expensive but it s worth it in my view
positive,29/5/20,found this to be an excellent product for making cherry limeades to flavoring yogurt have made this one of my pantry staples
positive,9/12/20,as i have stated before i love cheery flavor so this was awesome and my sweetheart liked it too you can add as much water to it to suit your own taste
positive,4/8/20,this is very good i am taking it because i have some gout at the tips of my toes and i exercise intensely every day so i want to protect my joints it s part of my daily health regiment it s got a good taste but the directions say take two tablespoons for a oz glass seems too diluted for me so i put tablespoons to a oz glass seems to taste better i haven t tried taking just a tablespoon straight yet
positive,31/7/20,these bars kick fruit butt they really are one of the best breakfast bars that i have ever tasted plus they appear to be somewhat healthy which is always good i can eat one of these for breakfast and be satisfied
positive,13/6/20,get the variety pack first and try each one i like all three but the peppermint chocolate and dark chocolate i like the best
positive,21/11/20,my year old loves this product it is a nice little variety pack i am going to subscribe for every months best hot chocolate k cups made
positive,25/5/21,i was honestly a little afraid to try this tea because it gets so many mixed reviews in general and especially after reading about pu erh s fermentation process but i am so glad that i didn t let all of that discourage me this is a very smooth rich full bodied tea that satisfies someone like me who drinks lots of bold dark coffee it definitely has a very earthy taste that is very invigorating any time of the day i used to think that black tea was my favorite but that has definitely changed what makes this specific brand better as well is the fact that the seller is extremely fast at shipping the item
positive,25/5/21,read some reviews that said this tea could taste strong and earthy but generation pu erh tea was surprisingly nice much nicer than green tea i m very happy with this product and the service was exceptional shipping incredibly fast thanks

positive,10/2/21,these are a great alternative to high calorie snacks great with salsa or any type of dip also great as a side with soup
positive,9/10/20,product came quickly and in great condition they taste great the bags are larger than the little snack bags of chips i usually get i am very pleased
positive,31/7/20,when ever possible i try to buy the duncan hines angel food cake mix as it s the best tasting box cake mix on the grocery shelf some of the other angel food cake mixes may have a slightly funky after taste the duncan hines brand does not the cake mix is easy to prepare and bakes up tall and light highly recommend note i like the two step version of this cake mix but it s no longer made
positive,13/6/20,i had been buying the store brand for years but skippy reminded me why it s okay to spend the extra few cents to have better taste
positive,5/12/20,this is really nice to have when you just want something a little different it makes drinking a cup of coffee step out of the ordinary
positive,1/11/20,this is very tasty jerky but i m laughin at the spicy part i had no idea it was supposed to have some heat to it until i read the package a little more carefully really it is not hot spicy at all to me but does taste good the pack i ate was filled with lots of smaller pieces and only a few slices i didn t find it overly dry just kind of moist and chewy great high protein snack for low carbers and anyone else less than gram of carb per serving calories per serving and servings per bag but you ll probably eat the whole bag because it s not that much enjoy
positive,14/1/21,these seeds taste very good they arrived much quicker than i had anticipated i especially enjoy these seeds sprinkled on top of soup instead of crackers i am trying to cut back on the amount of grains i consume
positive,6/6/21,i don t generally care too much for the healthy alternatives especially when it comes to coffee however after trying truvia at a hotel i am now hooked i usually get it at the grocery store but it is good to see that it is available on amazon and now that i have prime i might just be getting it online instead this sweetener tastes really good and in addition to coffee i have had it with desserts and it tastes great i think it even tastes better than sugar and definitely tastes better than splenda i cannot comment as to the health aspects related to artificial sweeteners but i m sure that there is plenty of information available on the internet related to that as a casual coffee drinker i highly recommend truvia however you may be better off purchasing a larger box or count instead of this pack of six unless you just really like the size of the count boxes but if you have never tried it definitely purchase a smaller box to try it out first
positive,21/7/20,i ordered this as i had been missing ramen noodles since i became vegetarian i wanted something that was tasty and yet healthy these noodles are so much better than i had expected i would highly recommend
positive,5/1/21,my daughter loves these in fact she loves any type of annie s bunny crackers they are definitely a healthier option for snack crackers
positive,23/1/21,got some of this on sale at the local grocery store today was impressed with the taste the energy boost isn t much different from other products to me however the taste is something i d actually drink as a regular drink impressive since many energy drinks are foul tasting
positive,31/7/20,my wife drinks about cups of these a day and loves them we always have enough on the shelf and they don t go bad no caffeine so she sleeps like a baby

positive,31/7/20,they crumble easily and i can use water from my coffee pot minus the coffee of course and the variety of flavors it a win sure the calories are a bit high but you can work that off in no time the good quick easy and flavorful the bad the calories overall i will keep buying them while deployed
positive,14/1/21,great taste and convenience for quick addition of onions to recipes that include a lot of liquid at the beginning of the cooking cycle soups rice etc
positive,7/12/20,i was tentative ordering kcups of this flavor but figured for it was worth a try i like these for my taste they are not too sweet and i definitely am glad i got them not too watery even at the oz setting all in all i like the flavor and am waiting for another deal a little kalua is not bad at night either
positive,5/5/21,i really enjoyed this i bought it when it was on sale for for two boxes i don t drink but i think this would make an excellent cocktail with rum vodka or whiskey i will say though it s very rich i usually only drink a couple gulps i d like to try it with different syrups like maybe raspberry syrup or put ice cream in it
positive,23/11/20,great product but boy did i waste money buying this from amazon it only cost in the local asian supermarket
positive,29/8/20,my kids loved this tasty treat the apple pieces were a nice size and tasted like a fresh apple will be buying more of these in the future
positive,18/1/21,this is a much better tasting instant tea than anything else lipton currently makes it is not as convenient coming in the big jar vs the individual packets but the taste is well worth it lightly sweet with just a hint of tea highly recommend

positive,13/9/21,bold and tangy the taco bell spicy ranchero sauce is excellent we ve used it with tacos and with flautas and now there is none left in our sample bottle everyone liked it even those who normally don t care for spicy foods off to the grocery for more
positive,18/6/21,this sauce is pretty good it s calories per tablespoon i tried this sauce with chicken and really liked it it s not too spicy at all i don t usually eat spicy food and am very sensitive to even small amounts of heat in my food this sauce hardly had any heat at all
positive,7/7/21,the taste of this sauce isn t anything earth shattering but it s good had it on my lunch turkey wraps for a few weeks and four dabs went a long way for flavor not spicy at all creamy and just the right zip to spice up something a tad without the hotness or watery consistency of salsa

positive,7/7/21,this popcorn has pretty fair flavor plain i always add buttery oil and salt to it because i m a fat fat i purchased this bag of popcorn months ago and i still have about pounds left next time i think i will get the pound bag and i won t have to worry about buying popcorn for the rest of my life you will save a ton of money by purchasing bulk bags of seeds and a popcorn popper i highly recommend this product along with the presto poplite hot air popper white for all popcorn lovers
positive,27/7/21,this popcorn is very good its cheap but it doesn t taste like it very fluffy this is the perfect popcorn for people who don t want to spend bucks on bags of popcorn
positive,13/7/21,some of my friends who i have offered these to say they taste like soap and even i have to admit they have a very unusual taste but that is what i love about them and they leave your breath smelling wonderful for a really long time afterwards i first purchased these at world market but here i got them at less than half of what they sell them for each there live on the edge try violet candy today i wish they also made them in lavendar flavor too
positive,13/9/21,this is another in a series of good kashi cereals i have yet to have a bad one

positive,10/3/21,i purchased this on a whim after eating a butternut squash pasta dish at a very nice restaurant i am very leery of canned jarred pasta sauce and almost always prefer to just make my own from scratch however this sauce is just divine it has a very robust taste and is pleasantly sweet i paired it with cheese ravioli and it was just perfect i think that it would be great with just about any pasta it is a pleasant change from a tomato based sauce and is very satisfying i highly recommend
positive,17/4/21,i ve tried many types of chocolate drinks since i don t drink milk this one along with trader joe s chocolate soymilk are my favorites would give stars except that it s pretty expensive
positive,21/1/21,a friend of mine has suggested leilalove french macaron to me it is realllllly awesome if you are a cookie lover it worth testing plus beautiful package and on time delivery
positive,30/1/21,i first purchased this product at bj s wholesale club this is the best flavored carbonated water i ve ever had like other reviewers bj s discontinued in favor of another product what a mistake i wrote to talking rain and their new president requesting this product have an online outlet and it seems they delivered yes it is more expensive but with super saver shipping and subscription service savings i m in for a few cases each month try it you will love it
positive,13/2/21,i purchased this on a whim based on a co worker s comment about how much they like this brand it s not the best value at each on subscribe save but i was interested enough to give it a shot i m glad i did all three flavors were great and each time i picked one up i was saying this is definitely my favorite flavor but then i d say the same on the next one and let s just call it a vicious circle i did want to point out and why i deducted star the picture of the product listed shows pomegranate berry orange mango and black raspberry however the package that was received had lemon lime in place of pomegranate berry while it was a great flavor i was looking forward to trying the pomegranate berry i m hoping maybe my next shipment is what is shown on the picture
positive,15/1/21,i liked the taste of these cookies and they reminded me of my childhood however these are packaged different they are sealed in a plastic wrapper not the wax type paper from a long time ago i am guessing that this keeps the graham crackers fresh tasting for a long time they were crispy and had a decent taste my only complaint was that several of the packages were damaged and the crackers were crumbs
positive,6/3/21,these graham crackers are a lot better tasting than the organic graham crackers that i have tried and compared to other brands generic i much prefer the crunchy sweetness of honey maid the graham crackers taste so fresh and are the best for dunking in milk or tea i love these as an alternative to cookies fortunately the packaging ensures that the last graham cracker is as good and crispy as the first one the portable and palatable treats are great for kids or anyone on the go and for making perfectly shaped s mores
positive,8/6/21,as far as cookies go this isn t going to ruin your diet much and it s pretty tasty too three cookies and they aren t tiny cookies either are calories there are g of both fiber protein they aren t too sweet which is great for me these are called cookies but they seem more like crackers they are kind of dry which i don t mind but the blueberries make them a little chewy the ingredients do not list sulfur dioxide a color preservative for many dried fruits yay sulfur gives me hives anyway as of right now these are per package for packages of servings each i m hoping these become subscribe save items these are good i will probably get them again
positive,7/1/21,newtons fruit thins are quite delicious as soon as you bite into one of these crispy cookies you can taste the real blueberries right down to a few seeds but i did not specifically notice the brown sugar flavor they are just the right thickness to be crispy not hard the package contains a plastic tray with rows of cookies cookies in each row very enjoyable
positive,17/4/21,these cookies were unexpectedly tasty and crispy given the fact that there was no hydrogenated fat in them i always look at the list of ingredients for the word hydrogenated even when the label says no trans fat they re not too sweet with a slight taste of blueberry and brown sugar i agree with other reviewers that they have an addictive quality to them and with only calories for three cookies about calories per cookie one could get into trouble by overindulging my husband and i really liked these however these would be perfect for dunking in milk or crumbling over ice cream enjoy
positive,10/3/21,these cookies aren t like the traditional fig newtons fruit newtonss i have bought in the past they look more like a thin cracker the cookies are also crunchy like a cracker but definitely not as dry they are sweet but not too sweet and very blueberry they remind me of the very top of a blueberry muffin which is a good thing i ll definitely buy more of these for my family
positive,14/1/21,it s incredibly tasty i d recommend that any hot spice lover give it a try i ll attempt to give an objective description but well it s a spice you ll really have to taste it yourself hotness mild or roughly like tabasco brand pepper sauce original red oz saltyness none it s just pepper absorption v high v finely ground unable to observe any small flecks after cooking into my standard spice test top ramen variety pack ct oz beef oz chicken it has a very clean smooth taste almost like adding pure hotness to food without the smoky overtone of tobasco the roughness of black pepper or the cumin of chili sauces it has a very slight cling or linger ie as with habanero peppers where the more you eat the hotter it gets one or two sips of water will wash it clean i haven t tried it with mixed spiced and milder dishes but due to how easy it is to sip the hotness away it should work very well there
positive,24/5/21,i like this flavor but it kind of reminds me a jello pudding bites and those things are just nasty i mostly use this one for recipes to create new flavors
positive,14/10/21,i encountered this snack in a vending machine liked it and bought a case for travel i think it is very tasty stuff and reasonably healthy especially compared with other packaged snacks
positive,29/3/21,i have loved ultra thin pretzel sticks since mr salty used to sell them then for decades i never saw an other ultra thin pretzel sticks and didn t even know if any were available anywhere then i saw them at a local department store and was ecstatic but then after going twice they discontinued them these are the ones that were at the department store i was disappointed but decided to give amazon com a shot and see if i could find them here and i did they even have a subscription plan where you can get a case every month months or months and the price for a case is reasonable especially if you go with the subscription at which time your shipping is always free just buying a case costs way too much with shipping i wasn t too thrilled with the idea of having to have a subscription just for free shipping but you can cancel at any time and i found that having a case on hand is nice and so we re getting them every months that gives us time to eat what we want share with our grown kids and grandkids and still give us time in between orders to not get sick of them it s great i highly recommend these especially if you love ultra thin pretzel sticks like i do
positive,10/7/21,these k cups are a quick and tasty way to make a hot cup of cider i have tried several brands of k cup cider and this is by far the best the caramel flavor is also very good

positive,2/7/21,i originally purchased these to use as a fun gift for a secret sister and happened to be starving when they arrived in the mail today the crackers cheese spread and pepperoni were incredibly tasty the dried fruit complimented the trio well and the chocolate toffee was a perfect top off i immediately got online to order another variety to try it seems like a small meal but it has kept me full all afternoon i m going to package two in a gift basket along with a bottled drink and some napkins seems a napkin is the one thing the gopicnic folks forgot they ll be perfect for an early fall afternoon in the park hope the other meals will make it to the gift wrapping stage
positive,10/4/21,one of the best i ve tasted takes a bit longer to make but worth the effort
positive,22/7/19,my son was nursed and then we found out he was allergic to cow s milk i couldn t get him to drink any other milk alternative he loves this product my only complaint is that it doesn t come in single serve sizes so when we travel i am constantly carrying around the big container in a cooler for day trips in the car this is fine but this stinks for airplane travel i have tried to serve him the single serve of rice milk but he simply will not drink as much as this he loves it
positive,2/2/20,great taste and easy to carry with you for whenever you may want flavored water the taste is not overpowering or too bland i prefer this to just plain water
positive,2/2/20,these cranberries are plump and taste great they have a nice aroma and just the right amount of sugar great
positive,31/8/19,i am not a rice connoisseur and the roland thai jasmine rice is the first type of jasmine rice i have ever tasted to me this rice looks like basmati rice long and thin grains it cooks pretty well turns fluffy and fast in the microwave i add cups of water for every cup of rice and the cooked rice looks like cooked basmati rice the rice tastes good too although i have to say i prefer the taste of real basmati rice
positive,22/7/19,these are my favorite dark chocolate i don t like overly sweet chocolates and love the combination of salt and dark chocolate these are very tasty and just the right size if you want to have a small daily dose of dark chocolate but don t want to load up on calories
positive,12/1/20,we used to raise montmorency cherries and these dried cherries are the real deal as dried fruit they re perfect moist chewy and wonderfully flavorful they make a wonderfully energizing snack at the office though i generally don t like added sugar on dried fruits it s really necessary to counteract the cherries naturally tart taste reconstituted i m guessing they d be perfect for tart cherry pies certainly the flavor is everything i remember in a really good tart cherry pie which is almost impossible to find these days
positive,19/2/20,in the great british trifecta of british powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar horlicks the most malty milo is medium chocolately and malty and ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately all are basically comfort drinks when plain milk just won t do all are powders to which you add milk and sugar to get a sweet malty drink the latter two with chocolate flavor as well i love all drinks but if you are drinking this for nostalgia s sake make sure you get the milo from where ever your nostalgia springs from because milo is made in different countries and they all taste a little different for me i love milo for it s good mix of chocolate and malt not too much of either and a great comfort drink for cold nights
positive,27/11/19,i made pumpkin bread for the first time a few weeks ago with some fresh pumpkin my husband needs to eat gluten free so we tried this baking mix instead of wheat flour it was delicious we all thought it was so wonderful that we bought more pumpkins just so we can make more the only thing that i don t like is that it has a small amount of corn starch in the baking powder and my son is on a corn free diet
positive,12/12/19,this meat is very fresh and taste very good its already cooked you just warm it up in the frying pan its sliced thin its lot better than the one at the restaurants
positive,26/9/20,i ve had a hard time figuring out the right amount to use but this product tastes great it was shipped quickly packaged well
positive,22/7/19,this adds a great taste to your popcorn its not easy to get the same measurement each time and removing it from the container provided is a bit of a task the price of this product is high and even higher depending on your location shipping costs are very high and are on the rise this product does not yield as much popped corn as some other products but it still is the best for taste gives a great flavor from the initial popping and not adding any toppings
positive,2/2/20,if those dense heavy nutrition bars are too rich for you to tolerate or if you can t handle them after a hard workout this one is worth trying it s very tasty and light the wafers give it a nice texture and crunch and it will remind you of those creme wafer cookies from childhood but much tastier and with better nutrition i will say that if you re looking for a super bar this may not be ideal because it does have a little more fat in it than other bars i like and a bit less protein and carbs but it s worth buying because it tastes really good it s light and easy to digest for me this is a great meal replacement bar snack or great after a light to moderate workout
positive,23/5/20,i chose this product as i am not crazy about chocolate flavoured products this goes well with coffee and good if you are in a hurry it keeps me full till lunch time i worry about the fat content however i probably would need an input from a dietician regarding that
positive,22/11/20,i really like all the power bars flavors great for when you want a snack but don t want all the bad stuff that comes with other protein bars i also like the crunch when i m craving chocolate it really hits the spot and dulls my cravings
positive,30/3/20,i like this product because it basically does what i anticipated as long as you have a full glass of water with it it will keep you feeling full for a few hours
positive,8/7/20,i have tried lots of different protein bars but the main problem is always the same they taste like protein bars this is my favorite because it tastes like eating a normal chocolate waffer candy bar chocolate is my favorite followed by peanut butter great for a snack i take one with me when i go out with friends so i have a tasty healthy treat
positive,4/1/20,these energy bars taste great and come in a variety of flavors they are low in carbs which is what i need
positive,30/1/21,seriously calories these are so good and even better if you add a little bit to them if you know what i mean
positive,2/11/20,i have been trying all kinds of diet drinks because i am getting tired of just water all the time so many diet drinks have a strong after taste or no flavor at all i have always liked crystal light drinks but have been hoping for some new flavors these new moctails flavors are great they have a very different flavor from their other mixes the mojito flavor is refreshing and has a wonderful taste i definitely recommend you try all the moctails flavors you won t be dissapointed
positive,22/7/19,i was pleasantly surprised at the new crystal light drink mixes the mojito flavor tastes a lot like the real thing there is a strong lime taste and sort of an after taste of a kick of mint this was my second favorite of the three varieties available but it was pretty tasty and a nice change of pace
positive,2/2/20,i haven t crystal light since it was still made with saccharin but i have been wanting to lose some weight and stop drinking so many sugary drinks but it s hard being most diet sodas end up giving me a headache anyway i went out on a limb and i tried it it was delicious you could hardly even taste the artificial sweetener and the flavor was yummy i don t drink alcohol so i have never had a real mojito but this had just the right amount of mint to add a little something to the lime i have tried a recipe from paula deen for a honeydew limeade with mint and it s one of the best drinks i ve ever had but it s also loaded with sugar and with all the fruit it ends up costs bucks a pitcher so i usually only make it once or twice a summer but this has the same flavors of mint lime and a sweetness if only they added some honeydew but then it won t be a mojito i guess i will definitely be getting it again and it didn t even give me a headache like diet soda does stars
positive,4/10/20,i enjoy many other flavors of crystal light but i got bored of them all for a long time recently i bought a container of the mojito flavor and i m hooked great taste like a children s version of a mojito i drink a lot more water liquid each day because of these little packets great alternative to diet soft drinks and water
positive,1/4/20,ideal is the right name for this low calorie yes sweetener absolutely no funky aftertaste acts just like sugar and tastes like it too
positive,8/5/20,ok this salt is a must have if you really like to cook i think it has a good flavor and the price is really good even if you don t use it everyday it is good to add to your spices
positive,18/6/20,the coffee is excellent easy to order and always arrives in a short period of time love the convienence and am about to enjoy a fresh cup this morning we used to have coffee made in a drip coffee pot but by the time we would have a second cup the coffee lost much of it s taste and at times tasted burnt never happens with keurig coffee
positive,20/8/20,i take these for snacks sometimes just for lunch very filling can carry in your pocket with no mess love the flavor
positive,1/6/21,these are great tasting bars i could eat them all day but the problem is that they are not filling at all you eat one and it doesn t feel like you ate anything at all which is why i have to give it stars instead of one
positive,4/7/21,i purchased these bars as a meal replacement after a job during lunch the texture is a bit hard moat if not all protein bars are hard but these special k protein bars tastes great with grams of protein per bar it is a much better alternative then other snacks out there i only have other protein bars that i use as meal replacements after a workout or job and these special k bars tastes the best to me i will be buying more
positive,5/2/20,i saw that star rating and thought there s no way the folks at buffalo bills could produce a beef stick rated one out of five i bought them because of that one star and i was right its a star snack just like everything else they sell it is much better than any common slim jim or jack links beef stick
positive,22/7/19,i got a bag of this free at pax and was really surprised how good it was i mean gamers generally don t eat well but i like this better than most trail mix
positive,2/2/20,this was great i was not expecting jam to taste this good i will never switch back the only reason i do not use it every day is because i do not want to run out of it
positive,22/11/20,this stuff is delicious the flavor tastes like a combination of grape juice and cranberry juice it has just the right amounts of sweetness and tartness the size of each packet makes it perfect for adding to a bottle of spring water or a bottle of filtered water from home the little stix are very convenient and easy to open best of all it has no sugar no carbs and no calories a great way to jazz up your water without messing up your diet
positive,1/3/20,there s a very nice watermelon flavor to these candies if i had any complaint and i really don t it would be that i d prefer the candies individually wrapped otherwise i m pleased with my selection
positive,23/11/20,i eat this many times a week it s flavorful and great texture i d eat it even if i weren t gluten free
positive,5/4/21,great tasting and the added benefit is the fiber my son loves granola granola bars etc and with gf products it s really hard to find sources of fiber this is wonderful and it has fiber
positive,27/4/20,i rarely find this product in the grocery store in my rural town so i decided to make the online purchase kraft honey hickory smoke barbecue sauce is a mild sweet sauce nothing fancy but i really like it
positive,8/3/21,it s so hard to find gluten free foods that taste good this one is really delicious and it s easy to make
positive,30/1/20,narnia i first had turkish delight while i was in turkey there shops produce turkish delight and hundreds of other exotic treats fresh every town of more than a few thousand people seems to have at least one of these shops the sweetness of turkish delight varies by shop in its native homeland and this confection is a fine example so long as one doesn t eat all that sugar sifting around in the box i think there s so much so it will act as a natural preservative if you can t fit a quick trip turkey to get the genuine article hand made fresh then this is the best imported substitute i ve tried i wouldn t trust getting something like this from a regular retailer because of potential shelf life issues and i wouldn t trust confections obtained from a discount clothing outlet but on line through amazon i trust tangentially if you like turkish delight you owe it to yourself to visit the country of origin because there s many other delicious turkish confections you probably haven t experienced
positive,2/2/20,obviously taste is subjective i wanted to add my opinion and stars to the tally to this item because i believe it is worth it
positive,2/9/20,wanted organic walnuts and now i have them convenient that they are in separate bags so i don t have to open at one time good tasting bits and halves
positive,26/1/21,this is an excellent soy free alternative to peanut butter i even bake with it i make peanut butter cookies that people would swear are real peanut butter with this product it s definitely not a no stir product though it does arrive separated the oil tends to rise to the top and so it does need to be stirred from time to time this is still a fabulous product my children adore it
positive,9/1/21,i agree with previous review these don t resemble scallops in any way but they are very good i don t understand why they are so hard to find recipe suggestion cook ramen noodles throw in a handful of chopped skallops when the noodles are almost cooked just long enough to heat them up drain most of the water then add the spice packet not very classy but good and quick
positive,30/7/21,brewing this coffee took me back to my trip to kona and visiting the coffee plantations drinking a cup of this brew is the next best thing to being there
positive,30/10/20,great strong tasting gum but doesn t last long but is still worth it especially if your not allowed to have regular sf gum the cinnamon taste is very great
positive,3/8/20,although it is a bit alarming to have these given a star review by a cheesewhiz afficianado a condiment competing for most vile non food item on the supermarket shelf i am going to these actually are really fabulous they have a mealy texture and great oaty oily taste that is better than any other oat cake i have tried and better than any other cracker too my babies also love them and as non wheat products are suitable for the young and for the allergic
positive,29/1/21,i love these crackers and keep them on hand all the time they are great for soups cheese and cracker snacks to spread peanut butter on just plain or they are like chips can t eat just one i have them on subscribe save and they always arrive safely and on time a bit of trivia our parrots love them as snacks too
positive,24/10/21,this pasta was very good i was a bit skeptical at first about the pre cooked pasta in a container that did not need to be refrigerated but i ate it and had no ill side effects the instructions to heat up the pasta and sauce were simple and because it s not a frozen meal it only took about in the microwave the pasta was cooked well the sauce while simple marinara was really good just enough seasoning to make it taste good without taking away from the great tomato taste the marinara was also chunky and not pureed or watery or runny overall a very good product that i would eat again
positive,16/10/21,my japanese grandma drinks a homemade mix of apple cider vinegar and bananas for health and this drink is black pungent and quite frightening hongcho vinegreat is a great alternative and actually tastes really good don t let the vinegar scare you off it is really quite sweet and you just get a little hit of the tang going down i guess it really depends on how much you dilute it i believe the package says for a strong taste or or for a lighter taste i ve tried both the pomegranate and blueberry flavors and they were both good you can also mix the concentrate with milk yogurt or even make a salad dressing out of it the bottle recommends drinking after a work out after a bath or before bed the purported benefits of drinking vinegar including overall well being improvement in digestion speeding up metabolism and skin benefits i ve only been drinking this for a short time so i can t really say if i ve noticed any difference in health as far as the amazon price i got a smokin deal at my local h mart and picked up a bottle for only the regular price is bottle so the amazon price isn t too bad especially if you don t have a korean grocery store nearby
positive,24/10/21,tea has a great flavor besides a lot of health benefits it is mild tasting not strong at all here are a lot of bags in box so lasts a while
positive,25/9/21,used these cones for a back to school ice cream social everyone thought they were great i would buy them again
positive,19/10/21,i bought this for halloween treats ordered it on the th and it came on the th great service i like this candy bar better than the butterfinger bar which seems to fall apart when taking the bar out of the wrapper the chocolate seems to be a better grade in the clark bar
positive,20/10/21,great coconut oil purchased this to use when making my own popcorn it is great my whole family loves the taste after buying this i read that virgin coconut oil is the most healthy for popcorn was thrilled to get it see that it is virgin coconut oil love it hope it comes in a larger container for next time
positive,19/10/21,i have ordered this times now my son in afghanistan requested some of this to be sent to him he loves it it is a little salty but if you eat with low salt or no salt tortilla chips it tastes great you will love it
positive,15/6/21,when you follow the cooking directions it s excellent if you don t cook it into the pasta the flavor is ruined
positive,4/8/21,if you compare to buying the packs at walmart its a great price of the packs from walmart are this is the flavor is the best i have ever had i like spearmint but then a friend gave me a piece of this and its way better
positive,4/8/21,i had never tried green tea powder before but decided to get some after reading some reviews on smoothies and healthy drinks since i make about to smoothies a week i thought this would be a great addition to my different recipes i was a little surprised at how small the can was when i received it i don t know why since it is only oz which is a fairly small size it is a bit pricey for the size but worth the money if you really enjoy green tea or use it as a health enhancer
positive,18/7/21,i m not sure what else to say but it is a very tasty syrup it comes in a pretty standard bottle but it was packet very well and arrived in fine shape
positive,15/6/21,eden foods puts out the best tasting pumpkin seeds these are shelled she will removed these spicy ones don t have much more flavor than the regular ones but enough to make them worth getting instead of the regulars they are not hot at all oh and the best thing about these they are message free
positive,4/8/21,i like anything by this company and wish more flavors available from amazon the apple cinnamon is very versatile and makes especially good iced tea also
positive,8/6/21,can be eaten on its own not salty at all with each single serving porch
positive,15/6/21,very tasty bacon smoky sauce for eggs hamburgers non bacony items that could use some bacon goodness hubby is thrilled not a spicy hot sauce cool that it s veggie friendly
positive,4/8/21,dead heat is the finest quality gucci hot sauce i ve ever tried and i m an experienced hot sauce aficionado it s hot enough to be powerul use one drop at a time yet not so hot as to be dangerous to the touch or unusuable for cooking people who make hot wings at home and who are looking for a superior hot sauce to add a measured heat to your wings this is your sauce very very good
positive,25/9/21,i like this mixture very much it could be less expensive but for taste and quality it is worth the price
positive,19/10/21,marley s mellow mood is fantastic not only does it taste great but it really works best thing since sliced bread i highly recommend you try some
positive,4/9/21,soft flavorful and fun i feel a little goofy eating these inch long fruit rolls but they do taste great
positive,31/8/21,we were getting these for free at work we stopped getting them so i went to smart and final to buy my own my local smart and final did not have them so i ordered a box from amazon can t wait to get them they are a great snack
positive,9/10/21,i don t generally care too much for the healthy alternatives especially when it comes to coffee however after trying truvia at a hotel i am now hooked i usually get it at the grocery store but it is good to see that it is available on amazon and now that i have prime i might just be getting it online instead this sweetener tastes really good and in addition to coffee i have had it with desserts and it tastes great i think it even tastes better than sugar and definitely tastes better than splenda i cannot comment as to the health aspects related to artificial sweeteners but i m sure that there is plenty of information available on the internet related to that as a casual coffee drinker i highly recommend truvia however you may want to try one of the smaller box sizes before purchasing a larger quantity just be sure that you like it
positive,15/6/21,i first tasted this coffe at a casino and was delighted with the wonderful taste it has good flavor and is very affordable i highly recommend it
positive,4/8/21,perhaps i did not read the packaging well this is a lot of candy the toffee melts in your mouth and the chocolate is well done i ended up taking two of the over stuff packages to work where they disappeared in two days wow this heath is really delicious not one bar was broken
positive,15/6/21,great taste and easy to make in very little time great when adding raisins and whatever your likes and variations may be
positive,4/8/21,love dreamfields pasta can t get the lasagna noodles where i live so i was so happy to find them at amazon delivery was quick the only thing is the noodles got broken in shipment which was a dissappointment
positive,15/6/21,overall the product is fantastic and the coffee is great i am giving a review of stars only because amazon s advertising is misleading it does not come in the advertised box as someone else indicated it s an unmarked box with smaller bags on the inside it is not a plastic k kup the product that you receive is what is pictured with a filter type bottom it does fit in your keurig and brews just fine i love the aroma and the taste of this coffee reminded my husband and i of espresso we had in siily italy a few years ago
positive,4/8/21,the first thing i would like to say is that the bottom of the k cup is a mesh not plastic but it still goes in my keurig machine just like a regular plastic bottom k cup i don t understand what the fuss is all about it does look a little different from what you may be used to seeing but works just the same now as to the taste of the coffee i think that it is a full body flavor if i want a strong taste i brew regular size amd if i wish to have a milder flavor i will brew the largest cup size i have the best of both worlds i immediately went on subscribe and save i order boxes at a time love the flavor of this coffee now to my complaint i notice today that the price of each box has increased approximately a box and that is within about three weeks time now i really love the convenience of my keurig however eventually the price of the k cups will reach a price that will because me to say no more that time is approaching quickly this brand started out to be more reasonable than most but with this price jump in the last three weeks i am afraid they the company will soon be way overpriced as are the other brands again i will say i do love the flavor of this coffee did i mention my husband likes it as well and he normally does not like decaf coffee
positive,1/10/21,we ve tried alot of the josef products they re all absolutely delicious glad to see amazon is offering them as they can be hard to find their cookies fit the bill for those with allergies to multiple ingredients but you d never know they were allergy friendly from the taste they re worth the price i can serve them to guests kids and adults alike and they never know the difference
positive,1/7/18,at a couple bucks a bag indulge yourself heavy with the caramel and the flavor a bit light on the nuts but they are in there the cranberries are a very nice touch if you like something chewy with your caramel corn comparable to poppycock but a bit more flavor and lighter on the nuts a very good change of pace
positive,10/8/18,this has one of the best taste out there on the market i wish it would go on subscribe and save
positive,13/9/18,i bought this for my wife and she loves it so i ll give it a this isn t just tea there is powdered milk involved too i was surprised so if that isn t your thing
positive,17/7/18,i ve never been much of a fan hazelnut but i do enjoy drinking the international hazelnut non dairy creamier mixed into my morning cup of coffee
positive,16/1/19,great flavor and a good start to my morning fiber one honey clusters ounce boxes pack of
positive,16/1/18,finally a high fiber cereal that tastes great i like mixing the honey cluster with either the carmel or the raison cluster for an even higher fiber load and the lowest price i ve found these cereals in on amazon com we all love saving money while being healthy right try it for days and i m sure you ll love it like i do thanks and have a healthy day
positive,16/1/19,although they are a bit expensive every now and then these candies are worth considering i wish they sold them in the states because they are so unique in both taste and texture
positive,1/7/18,the pomegranate flavor in this tea makes it a winner it has that little bit of extra something that you just need sometimes when you drink a lot of tea something different a different flavor if you like to eat pomegranates you ll like this if you re not a fan of the fruit you probably won t be a fan of this tea it has that little bit of zing that the fruit has and it s just perfect to drink while watching the sunrise
positive,10/8/18,i thought that this was a very tasty treat very comparable to non gluten free ones i have had in the past before finding out i was gluten intolerant
positive,15/2/20,fantasicakes sent my cake fast and it was also sent moist for me it s hard to go wrong with chocolate but this cake really is fantastic the icing comes on the side so you can warm it up and drizzle it on at your leisure i really liked that because i don t normally like a lot of icing love it
positive,22/4/21,these are excellent don t taste sugar free at all they taste just like the regular version and they are sweetened with splenda with no chemical sweeteners they re a little pricey but make a good treat
positive,25/9/20,great taste candy gets a gooey texture after sitting on counter wrapper sticks to candy other than that the candy is perfect
positive,16/11/19,i always avoided salt and then i learned about the difference between table salt and sea salt this tastes great on meat a little on eggs you name it i am using it i love the lb bag and the cost is very fair cheaper than buying at a store
positive,9/9/20,for an all natural diet drink this is amazing it has a better taste then most other rootbeers that are found in stores and is better for you i originally didn t realize this was diet when i bought it but i don t mind at all it is actually much better in my opinion then the non diet version but its up to you note this is really only a good deal if you get free shipping through amazon prime because when these are on sale in stores they cost about the same give or take
positive,1/7/18,i grew up in portugal eating the real thing fresh grilled sardines and these are very close to that they re the best that i have found in this country highly recommend plus it s great that they are in olive oil
positive,10/8/18,i love zevia soda it has a weird aftertaste for some but i am in love with this soda that is good for you it does have a very citrusy taste
positive,15/1/20,i ordered this syrup on a whim and i made the right choice it s very tasty
positive,1/9/20,i have been eating this for years but it is hard to find in the regular grocery stores so i purchased it over the web it is great for a fast tasty meal we add bite sized chicken breast to it and it is plenty for people
positive,22/7/21,this coffee has a smoother and more mellow taste than less expensive brands such as folgers and maxwell house and this is a terrific price compared to grocery store prices
positive,1/7/18,this is a fantastic chocolate bar you can t even tell it is dairy free this is not a milk chocolate flavor it tastes more like a marriage of milk and dark chocolate i am actually not usually a fan of dark chocolate but this is not overwhelmingly dark at all it is perfect
positive,10/8/18,this particular flavor of folger s gourmet coffee didn t turn out to be my favorite in their gourmet line but it was pretty good nonetheless all of their flavors are good
positive,14/5/21,exactly what thai iced tea should be i love how each tea bag is individually wrapped allowing me to take the tea anywhere for me to brew keep in mind packaging can be misleading though showing the tea with milk this tea doesn t have milk in it and you ll need to add it yourself aside from that the product itself is excellent though
positive,17/10/19,very tasty great color recipe on back may be a little too spicy for a thai food virgin start with amount
positive,3/10/21,stocked up for work when it was on sale per package good for emergencies but wouldn t buy it otherwise
positive,30/8/20,first time id ever purchased whole nutmeg and i am glad that i did it is so much better than already ground nutmeg lasts longer and it quiet simple to use with a good microplane grater
positive,1/7/18,just a little pricy but worth having made from corn much better than the rice if you haven t tried this i would strongly suggest you give it a try and by buying it at a time it also saves you money
positive,10/8/18,tinkyada brown rice penne pasta with rice bran ounce bags pack of tinkyada makes pasta that actually tastes like pasta i have tried many different brands and nobody comes close to tinkyada if you are allegeric to wheat you can have great tasting pasta again
positive,5/12/19,this is the best gluten free pasta i ve eaten best of all my kids love it
positive,8/9/20,i am really a huge advocate of cooking from scratch with all fresh ingredients but i really love these seasoning packets especially the one for pork this has not only nice flavors but a bit of thickening i use it whenever i make split pea soup one packet of this per lb bag of peas and only use half the amount of water they say to use on the bag of peas beautiful thick split pea soup every time or a pot of beans with ham shanks and it always comes out beautifully flavored i don t add salt when i use this but other herbs can be used of course with fantastic results this comes in several other flavors now but this is the one that i use the most just store the packets in airtight containers such as lock lock and they keep practically forever
positive,22/9/21,this product is fantastic i have had creme brulee many times in france and this is just the same i would recommend it to anyone and my guests have just loved it
positive,2/10/20,i am allergic to peanuts but i can eat all other nut butters i like the taste of this product and the soy bits give it a texture like crunchy peanut butter i recommended it for those who are allergic to peanuts
positive,25/7/20,the lemon flavor was evident in this product the price was right and just big enough to satisfy our needs would buy again
positive,4/7/21,we keep a box of these in our supply bin in the back of our vehicle for snacks on the go yummy
positive,11/9/21,i was first turned onto this product from a review from cook s illustrated whose american test kitchen rated them the best tasting they are absolutely the best tasting they cost more but it is worth it for the end result and they re organic to boot
positive,4/7/21,i first found this product in the checkout lines at austrian groceries when i returned back to the us i ordered this from amazon to share with co workers they are espresso filled chocolates and are quite good i had to warn co workers to put the entire thing in their mouth because the espresso is liquid and will drip out if you bite my colleagues snapped them up quickly and we were energized for the rest of the day i had to hide them from my year old because she liked them too and would climb anywhere to find them she already has enough energy
positive,21/9/21,pilao is my favorite coffe i have tried several brands from around the globe but so far this is the best tasting not bitter nice and smooth
positive,11/9/21,i usually drink green tea and have used this tea during the summer for iced tea and love the taste very refreshing and prefer this over the store bran green tea
positive,12/10/21,this is a very tasty flavored coffee the flavor is not overpowering and provides an extra little kick of awesomeness
positive,11/10/21,this coffee has a rich flavor and nice body without any bitterness no matter what kind of machine you use i enjoy it at all ties of day but especially in the afternoon or after a good meal exceptional depth i love my illy coffee
positive,28/9/21,the south beach diet bar dark chocolate offer a tasty but relatively healthy treat it has a rich though not overly sweet taste and is fiber rich while low on calories don t expect it to taste like candy this is a granola bar after all but it does offer a rare treat for those trying to lose weight while the heavier fiber intake may make it a little bit of an acquired taste the chocolate makes it a lot easier to acquire if the rest of losing weight could only be this easy
positive,19/10/21,i bought this because of the antioxidants will keep it for the taste tastes like arabica without being overwhelming its the best of both worlds when you can have a product that is good for you and tastes great too
positive,4/7/21,my wife has me order this item for her we look like we are a small convinece store in our garage this is the only product she has found to have no sweetner in it so it has flavor but calories and no fake sweetner either if you get bored drinking water try hint this flavor is her favorite
positive,12/9/21,this product was nicely packaged which made it easy to throw in my purse or briefcase the flavor was rich and satisfying i will buy this again
positive,13/7/21,simply put this stock has more flavour than most of the other options it will add depth to your soups and sauces if the flavour is too strong you can thin it down with a little water as a bonus it is consistently well priced on amazon and you don t have lug it from the grocery store
positive,23/10/21,this is the best tasting hot sauce ever yes hot sauce with a flavor my first bottle of this sauce came from a very very good friend when i found out what grocery store it came from i bought all they had now they tell me they cannot get it anymore so where do i go amazon but shipping for bottles of this fine hot sauce is more than the sauce its self

positive,24/10/21,this is a wonderful tasting turkey broth that is so convenient it is very shelf stable so it s handy to keep around the packaging takes up little room in a small kitchen it will be great in stuffing and gravy and will save me the time of always having to make stock before having turkey which i always do as soon as it arrived i put a cup of water into the microwave to boil and then added the contents of the little packet to the water the taste was more than i expected from a convenience product with the addition of some fresh herbs turkey drippings and flour you ll be having everyone at the table thinking you re a gourmet chef i ll be adding a few packs to the stock i make from the turkey carcass this year it will only help intensify that great turkey flavor i ll order this again in the future but for right now the amount i have on hand should last quite a while
positive,4/7/21,i bought this on whim one day while shopping the unusual flavor interested me when i popped it the wonderful smell of lime filled the kitchen the taste is great not over powering but refreshing tasty this would go great on a summer day or night with margaritas or beer great new flavor would never have thought of adding lime to popcorn but it works

positive,22/10/21,i didn t know what to expect since i have never used a pre cooked cornmeal before but i made delicious polenta with it the polenta was creamy and smooth and delicious with a very mild nutty corn flavor and the next day it had hardened and i slices it and fried it in a little butter and it was delicious my first go at arepas was not so successful but i think that i am to blame and not the product my only complaint is that it is hard to find recipes that use it

positive,17/4/21,this makes some great baked goods i m no baking expert but i can follow a recipe pretty well so far i ve used it in chocolate chip cookies and waffles i think people are right and saying that you should scale down the amount of vanilla needed i ve been using exactly what was on the recipe and i get just a slight alcohol aftertaste if you smell the vanilla right out of the bottle it is clear it s the vanilla you are tasting it s not unpleasant and i don t think anybody would really notice
positive,10/3/21,my daughter tells me these are the best tasting message hearts i ordered these after valentine s day just because she likes them so much
positive,17/4/21,open the lid on this lovely salt and you are struck with the unmistakable aroma of truffles the taste is even better a little goes a long way i add a pinch to eggs to turn ordinary into decadent like another review i also love this salt in popcorn i add a pinch to my oil usually clarified butter before popping and supplement with plain sea salt ground fine in the mortar and pestle a nice change of pace this salt is speckled with black truffle flakes that look something like ground black pepper the truffle flavor is infused throughout the salt i received on has a best before date of

positive,6/3/21,i really love black licorice but i could no longer eat it because of the items used in the manufacture of licorice that usually shows up in the stores this is very authentic and gluten free it does come in very large chunks which i cut into smaller pieces because i was chowing down way too much of this great candy at one time it is a tasty licorice
positive,8/6/21,tried this flavor first time in france this summer and loved the refreshing taste of it the blue and red ones are also very nice but my fav was the silver one too bad it s hard to find elsewhere
positive,7/1/21,this jerky is the soft chewy style though it is listed as sweet n spicy it s quite a bit more sweet than spicy i doubt even the most sensitive to spice would consider this spicy jerky it s tasty it doesn t have any nitrites message high fructose corn syrup or anything else that s terrible for you it s also affordable the only reason it didn t get five stars is that it s not an outstanding and amazing one of a kind flavor worthy of five stars

positive,14/10/21,there was a huge internet blow up over these candy corn oreos i love candy corn so i had to try them i have only two targets in my area and both were sold out luckily amazon has them available they have a slight taste of candy corn but not overwhelming on the sweet side interesting i really like the vanilla cookie taste so i enjoyed them my husband thought they were a bit too sweet for his tastes more for me

positive,10/3/21,i enjoy indian food but unfortunately the closest indian restaurant is miles away from my house i ve tried other commercial indian food products and have not been very pleased the kitchens of india butter chicken curry however is tasty just spicy enough for me well maybe a little on the mild side and easy to make i buy the costco rotisserie chicken debone it put it in pound zip lock bags and freeze them each envelope of the butter curry needs pound of chicken so i just pop the chicken out of the freezer defrost it add the curry paste and butter and in about minutes i have a delicious dinner i will definitely be ordering this product again
positive,10/7/21,both my daughter and i found this very tasty and it s so easy to make tastes authentic highly recommended
positive,27/1/21,this was a very easy curry paste to use and it came out very close to what you get at restaurants all i added was butter chicken and water i made servings with one packet of paste but i think if i had more chicken i could have made servings
positive,1/6/21,these cookies are tasty at times they re a normal part of my daily diet i ve eaten a bag for breakfast on multiple occasions also try trader joe s vegan trail mix cookies for an alternative i can t decide which ones i like better tj s are chewier both rank as my favorite cookies
positive,20/8/21,delicious only it is not enough for one serving rice are very tasty but gravy is not that great tast and also too much for the rice if they can pack more rice and less gravy that will be very fine
positive,14/8/21,i ve already reordered this item twice i like the taste of it it has the right amount of spice and can be used to make veg briyani if your not very fond of chicken i tried both one of the best products from koi recommended

positive,1/4/21,this is the best tasting and best price on a stevia product that i have found
positive,17/4/21,i enjoy the flavor and benefits of fresh wheat grass but it is difficult to keep on hand this powder seems to offer the same punch as well as tasting good i m very pleased with the product and now rely solely on it
positive,10/3/21,i have tried a few other wheat grass powders and had a hard time drinking them this was very mild i can drink it just mixed with water my year old and year old liked it and wanted more i love all of the amazing grass products they all taste great and are a great company to order from
positive,22/4/21,this tastes great although i do add a little more cinnamon it does not fill you up like homeade oatmeal does but it is still a nice product
positive,25/4/21,savory choice is the best stock i ve found and i love everything about it first off it s flavor is incomparable to any other pre made stock product and it really tastes like what chicken stock is supposed to taste like i shared it with my grandmother and it won even her stamp of approval secondly i love that it is concentrated so that you make up just the amount you need which is especially handy when you are deglazing a pan to make a sauce for example you don t end up with a whole quart container going bad in your fridge finally if there s anything i learned from ny apt living i love how small the footprint is of the box itself it s also great to pack for backpacking trips to keep in your desk at work etc they make chicken beef and turkey and around the bay area it s available at whole foods berkeley bowl andronico s etc
positive,1/4/21,i love coffee and this product was a nice mid afternoon pick me up it was refreshingly cold on a hot day and gave me that burst of caffeine energy that keeps me going i enjoyed the taste very much i like my hot morning coffee with lots of milk and a bit of sugar and this was similar to how i make it people who like their coffee black or with milk cream and no sugar will probably not like this product overall i was very pleased with it though i doubt i d buy it often at approximately two bucks a can
positive,30/6/21,i drink a couple of cups of strong black coffee every day but rarely a fancy drink from a cafe this product is convenient you can just put it in the refrigerator or open the can and pour it over ice or both the taste is smooth and well balanced it has plenty of caffeine and the right amount of milk and sugar i have had a very similar product from starbucks and i really don t sense much of a difference between the two i would probably buy whatever is a better value at the time again this product and the product from starbucks seem to taste the same to me and are of the same high quality
positive,1/3/21,this little can packs a good punch lots of flavor and a caffeine boost apparently all for just calories according to the can the flavor is very rich but not so rich that you can t finish it i drank it right from the can as i probably normally would and did notice a bit of a tin after taste from the can i poured the rest into a glass over some ice and it was excellent so if this is going to be your on the road solution you might think again but if you can enjoy it in a glass you won t be disappointed good stuff
positive,29/1/21,i have had the illy issimo coffee before and liked it so i was excited to try this iced coffee drink this cappuccino has a nice smooth taste with just enough sugar to make it sweet but not overwhelming it gave me a nice jolt of energy to get me through the afternoon but not leave me jittery i will buy this again
positive,17/4/21,this is a nice little coffee drink not too sweet only calories and as good as starbucks lo fat drinks would have preferred a glass container but the little cans fit really well in my handbag
positive,10/3/21,this illy issimo italian espresso style coffee drink with lowfat milk and cocoa is quite delicious the cocoa taste is subtle and it is not too sweet the smooth taste beats out other similar prepackaged drinks i ve tried each ml oz can is only calories g fat and g of protein so it feels like a decent choice nutritionally it contains mg of caffeine if you are counting illy roasts good coffee and even masked by the sugar and milk you can tell this arabica coffee is the good stuff it is very smooth no bitter burnt taste like some coffee roasters are prone to these drinks are made in denmark and distributed by coca cola in the us which piqued my interest i d recommend these to people who like to have some cold coffee drinks on hand for busy mornings or a quick pick me up
positive,30/5/21,this is the first cold coffee drink without crushed ice like a frappuccino at starbucks i have ever had i do enjoy coffee but during the summer i often turn to soft drinks instead i usually do not want a hot drink when it is degrees outside i was not sure what to expect from this but was surprised that it was quite delicious and refreshing being a cappuccino it has low fat milk which is nice since most places just use whole milk and a hint of cocoa not too much where you cannot taste the coffee but there is a hint that makes it perfect because of the low fat milk and cocoa this beverage has calories g of fat g sat fat g of carbs and g of sugar from label that is not too bad considering what some coffee beverages have the coffee is very strong and has a great taste it is not bitter and drinks very smoothly when i got this item i placed it in the fridge and it was in there fore a few days so it was nice and cold and it was very refreshing and smooth the coffee was the primary taste in the drink and the milk and cocoa were secondary so you got a nice taste of what tasted like high quality coffee with a smooth finish from the milk and cocoa i am very pleased with this drink and found it quite refreshing and a nice change from a standard cup of coffee especially during these hot days and with only calories it is a great start to the day highly recommend
positive,28/9/21,no complaints whatsoever this is a tasty coffee drink the coffee is strong and good and the sweetener is perfect just sweet enough without being that kind of sickly sweet that mars something like starbucks pre made iced coffee drinks just about perfect refreshing and a nice boost for the afternoon
positive,6/5/21,if you are already a fan of illy coffee in general whole bean ground espresso most likely you ll enjoy this can of cappucino coffee the flavor of this drink is heavy on coffee with light milk lowfat added the bitterness of the coffee is only lightly offset by the milk so hopefully if you decide on this drink it will be for a coffee flavor and not a more milky coffee flavor there is also a hint of sweetness though i did notice that the sweetness seems to be closer to the bottom of the can the can indicates that it shouldn t be shaken so maybe this is expected there are calories per can and gave me a decent caffeine jolt the can indicates this is a product of denmark and is distributed by the coca cola company the weird part here is that illy is an italian brand guess it costs too much to import from italy no idea there i only received one can as part of the vine program but have purchased single serve cans of this on my own and will without doubt purchase further cans of it
positive,20/4/21,this is one of my absolute favorites would recommend to anyone i have even gotten coworkers hooked on it because it is so good
positive,20/4/21,i tried this product on a whim hoping that it would be good to my surprise it was very good i was pleased that the ingredients did not include trans fat or high fructose corn syrup for a convenience item i give it high marks it tastes great and is extremely easy to prepare
positive,2/5/21,we got them to add to special k red berry cereal because sometime the end of the bag as fewer than the start but now we eat them by the hand full and add them to everything my daughter grabs the bag over other snack food which makes me smile
positive,19/1/20,one of the only apple drink mixes i found that tastes good i used to buy the walmart brand apple drink but that tasted too fake for my taste this one contains some sugar so it has some calories but taste wise it s like light apple juice with a hint of artificial flavoring
positive,19/1/20,these are wheat free gluten free non dairy granola bars they taste pretty good they re not listed as organic but it seems like they should make them that way since they re free of so many other things some of the ingredients are listed as organic but not all they taste good there are grams of sugar per each bar just fyi for anyone wondering about the ingredients for allergies or food sensitivities here they are in order gluten free oats organic agave rice blend brown rice flour white rice flour tapioca starch sweet rice flour xanthan gum coconut sugar raisins monounsaturated safflower oil organic eggs walnuts coconut chia seeds natural vanilla flavor sices baking soda sea salt xanthan gum grainless aluminum free baking powder sodium bicarbonate sodium acid pyrophosphate potato starch
positive,31/3/20,these bars are a tasty snack the taste is like a dry carrot cake it is a little chewy and has a nice texture with nuts and raisins it is surprisingly high in calories for each bar
positive,18/12/19,pamela s oat raisin walnut spice bars are moist and tasty although the ingredients are top notch they gave me heartburn
positive,13/10/19,the hotlix scorpion sucker is a pretty tasty pretty wild and a pretty fun treat for any occasion i used it for a presentation in by biology class and it was received very well by the teacher and my fellow students

positive,26/2/21,i like it it s got the same after taste as the granulated if you re wondering i find it pleasant used it in coffee today and it was the perfect sweetness and actually once it was in coffee to me it was the same flavor as sugar with no aftertaste i don t like splenda very much and can t stand sweet n low been using stevia for a few months and got this to stir into yogurt excited didn t realize it had to be refrigerated but that was just my own ignorance was hesitant but now i highly recommend the sweetleaf stevia clear
positive,18/12/19,adds flavor to all sorts of dishes great for deviled eggs mix with the yoke filler and top it off with a slice of jalepeno
positive,19/1/20,i have always wanted a tea i could drink at night that would not wake me up at in the morning i have always liked black currant so this was a win win for me the tea is delicious

positive,14/4/21,we ve had this spice blend since picking it up at a whole foods in portland after tasting a sample company was coming over and we needed something easy that could be prepped ahead enter the moroccan spice blend and it received rave reviews we used boneless skinless chicken breasts and marinated them for about a day and a half when it came time to cook we just dumped them into a x dish and baked as directed for an hour serving it with couscous moroccan carrot salad and coconut cupcakes we spent the rest of the evening thoroughly stuffed absolutely delicious sweet and savory the blend had just the right amount of kick without setting our mouths on fire fabulous
positive,24/4/21,this dip is absolutely delicious it is so easy to make the price is also exceptional
positive,28/4/21,this coffee tastes great i usually purchase folger s classic style blend from sams due to the convenience of the packaging and expected level of flavor one day i bought a oz package of from seatle s best from wally world wal mart for having already experienced the goodness from borders before they went bankrupt i was happy to see a great price on the product i absolutely have fallen in love with this coffee a cup of this and coldstone sweet cream creamer is great simply put i prefer to have my day start with that combination and i m saddened whilst i am at work and my cup finally runs empty however the price on bags seems a bit high as a pack of oz goes for on here as well huge markup on the pack which makes no sense
positive,12/7/21,we put this in everything it gives an extra kick to everything from sandwiches to egg salad to

positive,8/8/20,i tried mccormick smoked paprika a few months ago and was enchanted with this new flavor i started delving into indian cuisine and the ingredients listed smoked paprika i found this spice at the local foodlion store and it was quite expensive for a oz bottle i m glad to see this larger size at such a good price i like the taste of mccormick so i hesitate to try another brand highly recommended

positive,18/12/19,i tried these out last weekend just as the temps have started to dip and i was not disappointed i expected a very fake and chemical tasting brew but was pleasantly surprised that i got neither i was very happy to ready that there are no artificial ingredients in this one too this is a great alternative for when you want something different from coffee and tea if i had to point out anything bad about them maybe that the flavor is almost too sweet if you brew it on your smallest cup setting mine is oz for the keurig b special edition it is a tad tooo strong but in the medium size offerning its just right i hate having to buy packs though

positive,6/7/21,pasta knorr sauce parma rosa creamy tomato b i oopw pardon me while i rave about how incredible this pasta mix is but i m just totally in love with this sauce i love to eat pasta but i am usually confined to the higher fat alfredo sauces and cheese sauces because acidic tomato sauces irritate my acid reflux that means no spaghetti and meatballs which has been frustrating for me but that s life eh then while i was browsing the sauce aisle for knorr alfredo packets i found this parma rosa sauce i have no idea what vodka sauce is that the other reviewers reference but whatever this is it is good if i had to describe it i d call it a creamy tomato alfredo but even though it is creamy it is also very light and pleasing to taste not cloying the tomato taste is exquisite and the acid content is low enough to prevent stomach pains the taste itself is absolutely wonderful i can actually talk myself out of impulse eating by promising myself parma rosa later it s that good the knorr sauces are fairly easy to make the instructions are serious when they say to stir constantly though and i think it helps to preheat the milk before adding the powdered mix and they store indefinitely in these dried packets another reason to buy packets besides the smaller carbon footprint in shipping versus jars oh and buying them on amazon means i get them for half the price of the local market for the parma rosa i also add about a third of a pound of seasoned browned ground beef as easy meatballs the portions are such that i can easily get two full meals out of one sauce packet and the sauce stores perfectly in the fridge this coming from a person who generally hates leftovers ana mardoll
positive,13/8/21,this is a great product that is very easy to make it never clumps which is a great plus when it comes to dry sauce mixes i personally favor the knorr white sauces e g the alfredo or garlic herb which is the only reason why i m not giving this stars overall it s very enjoyable nice to have around when you don t want to make sauce from scratch and i would definitely purchase again
positive,5/6/21,i took this stuff on a two week camping trip i put it in chilli made tacos and soups this is the best tasting sour cream powder i ve ever come across buy this stuff now one bag lasted campers for about meals used as a condiment
positive,9/7/21,mushrooms can add a lot of flavor to a dish canned mushrooms are bland and boring and fresh mushrooms have a limited shelf life dried mushrooms pack a lot of flavor and have a long shelf life i believe they are good for up to years a one ounce package of dried is the equivalent of a half pound of fresh they need to be soaked in warm water for about an hour to hydrate before using the water used for hydrating can be used in your dish for added flavor it can also be reduced to concentrate the flavor once hydrated the mushrooms can be used in any application that you would use fresh or canned the chanterelles are a mild less earthy tasting fungus they go very well with eggs chicken and fish they are also great in a stir fry the fungusamongus is a high quality brand that i highly recommend
positive,17/6/21,we first tried this sauce in costa rica on vacation when we ran out of what we had brought home with us i was so glad to find it on amazon this bottle is huge and will last quite a while this sauce is really good it has a kind of smokey spicy flavor

positive,9/7/21,i like nature valley granola bars because they fill me up better than other brands such as special k or the quaker oats granola bars they re also chewy and sweet great for a snack or a quick breakfast my only complaint is that it is a little too sweet
positive,19/6/21,this is a really good product while it is only ounces it is actually about a quart of freeze dried shallots i have long used fresh shallots extensively in cooking and these are an excellent replacementwhen fresh is not required such as salads etc they save all the work of peeling and chopping fresh shallots for cooking the product while fairly costly as are fresh shallots is a real time saver and worth every penny of the cost freeze dried is much better than just plain dried i use freeze dried herbs whenever i can find them as they more exactly replace fresh products if you use shallots you will love this product
positive,5/9/21,these bars are quite tasty and a little crumbly if you factor in the weight to calorie ratio they are about the same ratio wise to nature valley bars the amazon or quaker description says ozs however each bar is only ozs the whole package of weigh oz but i did give them stars on taste because of my particular fondness for anything blueberry one would have to check pricing per ounce with other brands for the value conscious
positive,10/10/21,great simple snacks for those who are watching calories at calories a bar these have an amazing blueberry flavor and all natural texture there is no doubt that these will get you through your hunger to your next meal without packing on the pounds these bars are a step up in the granola breakfast snack bar catagory highly reccomended
positive,29/9/21,originally i hated this cereal becaused it tasted so bland and powdery when hot or cold however after eating it three times i have strangely learned to love it and now i ve been eating it for one month so this was an acquired taste for me that i will definitely order again when i get tired of my steel cut oatmeal if you are not use to eating healthy foods however you might dislike this cereal and never acquire a taste for it
positive,11/9/21,this flaxseed meal is the best ever i ve tried several brands that i purchased in local markets but it s not that easy to find whole ground flaxseed around where i live so the ones i was able to find had a sand like texture and taste my wife couldn t stand it despite of the known benefits of taking it this flaxseed texture is awesome for her and she s enjoying it she mixes with milk in the morning and smoothie in the afternoon and doesn t complain anymore about the taste i take it before the meals with juice and i think it has a wonderful nutty taste i had initially setup the subscription for every months but we liked it so much we are changing it for every months
positive,5/6/21,i love this product delivered on time and taste great i use a lot of butter in my cooking and this large size is perfect all the tasted without the bad stuff
positive,9/7/21,these biscuits are really good i bring them to school as a snack after practice or before lunch i think they are a lot better than nutri grain bars and quaker oats granola bars i ve also tried the apple flavored onesbut the blueberry ones definetely taste better it s also really easy to find coupons for them on the internet or just google belvita coupons
positive,26/8/21,this wasn t quite what i expected the last time i ordered a similar treat it was thinner crispy banana slices these are thicker bananas my dog loves them but there is so much banana that i can t give her more than one or two a week too rich they give her the runs but she loves them

positive,11/9/21,i have enjoyed using the maple flavor it adds flavor to my diet that i would not have without it
positive,11/9/21,how much is there really to say about salt the size of the ground crystals will depend on your grinder i find fine to be good for some foods like eggs and prefer a coarser grind for other foods potatos the sea salt has a more complex flavor than regular plain table salt for me the flavor of the sea salt is much prefered over normal salt
positive,15/9/21,this hafi lingonberry preserves not only arrived in a timely fashion but also adds favorably to our morning and afternoon snack experiences not too sweet not too tart my husband adds it to the very healthy shake he makes for the two of us each morning i also occasionally like to get my healthy bit of snack in by dipping a few toasted pita chips in the early afternoon when i get most hungry just one or two chips with a total of about one teaspoon of preserves will do it for me for a healthy snack that will not spoil my dinner very happy with the product
positive,5/6/21,i love oatcakes so of course like most i did the topping go around and i thought try something way different hear me out it s not bad marmite on oatcake lol try it sometime nairns oatcake is great with anything on it or nothing just depends on the person
positive,9/7/21,i bought a box of these as a special sure glad i bought when i did as the price went up drastically i love raspberries and wanted to try dark chocolate over milk chocolate these taste excellent i consider them a treat after dinner as if i was eating one of those very expensive chocolates but for much less the cost they are small enough that i don t feel like i am packing away pounds by eating one or two yet are very flavorful in a small candy i would buy again but having of them i have enough for awhile will probably take some to work to share with the group

positive,28/7/20,have been using this in my morning chai for several months now and it is absolutely incredible the only bad thing i can say about it is that it can be a little addictive follow up we usually like to use cream in our coffee as a treat on the weekends half nhalf what s that the other day we were out so i used the santini condensed milk instead all i can say is wow actually enjoyed it more than cream and then i compared the labels the condensed milk has considerably less saturated fat and cholesterol than cream we re never going back

positive,14/10/18,in the great british trifecta of british powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar horlicks the most malty milo is medium chocolately and malty and ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately all are basically comfort drinks when plain milk just won t do all are powders to which you add milk and sugar to get a sweet malty drink the latter two with chocolate flavor as well i love all drinks but if you are drinking this for nostalgia s sake make sure you get the ovaltine from where ever your nostalgia springs from because ovaltine is made in different countries and they all taste a little different for me ovaltine is the most chocolately of all and a great comfort drink for cold nights i like it more than simply hot chocolate because it s not as sweet and has a slight malty flavor to it best of all you can control the taste because you can adjust the amounts of sugar and ovaltine you add

positive,3/4/20,we happened to be at whole foods and a lovely woman was offering free samples of violas hot jalepeno jelly omg it is fantastic it s got a definite kick to it but it s not too terribly hot at all perfection it s just sweet enough to balance out the hot it s light and delicious and best of all it s not full of all the artificial preservatives and high fructose corn syrup and additives of which most jellies are contaminated i love this product
positive,7/8/19,i ve tried to capture the taste of really fine coffee i ve experienced in some excellent restaurants without much success including grinding my own beans buying expensive ones at specialty shops etc this product while not quite doing justice to my memories of great coffee comes closest it is somewhat expensive at about lb supermarket coffees are of course much cheaper and you can get larger packages at discount places for much much less i even tried mixing this coffee with folgers and it was pretty good too naturally this coffee is much richer so one needs to experiment a bit to figure out how much to use in your coffee maker i drink coffee straight up no sweetener no milk products but i like it pretty strong but not burnt or over roasted this coffee is not over roasted or bitter unless you use too much of it i found it superior to the other melitta products i ve tried as well as to other much vaunted brands such as starbucks seattle s best and gevalia but taste is on the tongue of the beholder
positive,9/3/18,update january i am now a pretty regular drinker of this stuff in fact i just ordered some more and i note the price has gone down which makes it very afforable take in the free shipping and it s an absolutely delicious steal i am really enjoying this coffee i usually drink folgers at home and have done so for nearly years this was a pleasant surprise the aroma as it was brewing was scintillating the taste with my regular creamer and sugar was a treat for my taste buds i finished two cups and was tempted to drink more because it was such a smooth tasting coffee i used heaped tea spoon fulls for make cups as marked on my coffee maker and it worked out just about right for me though some hard line coffee drinkers make like it stronger than that the package itself was a little hard to open i found the best way was to cut the top off with scissors and use the metal bands on the package to securely close it as airtight as possible this a really nice coffee but the only way to be sure you will like it is to try it
positive,18/5/18,i have long been a fan of german based melitta products and found their coffee to be far superior to most of the mainstream popular coffees and even some so called exclusive or select blends blanc et noir is one selection from their cafe collection which i would put in the medium to dark roast catagory a full bodied flavor without acidity but not too strong that is when made in french press i don t use old style leave it in the pot all day machines a lot of people have switched to the pod type or single cup brewing systems lately and in fact coffee consumption seems down in general in favor of herb teas and non caffeinated drinks so it was nice to go back to an old style ground coffee taste if you like european style ground coffees you may also like to try douwe egberts intense real coffee dark roast ground coffee ounce packages pack of which is dutch or the bold flavored jacobs kr ouml nung coffee ounce vacuum packs pack of another point worth mentioning is cost these value packs here work out pretty cheap compared to pod systems bags or cups and are even not that bad compared to everyday grocery store prices when compared to gourmet stores like gevalia they are a steal and great quality
positive,27/1/19,these bars were recommended to me by a nutritionist and fitness expert they are wonderful if you like chocolate you will love these bars they are also very good for you with all organic ingredients
positive,10/11/19,my son turned me on to this product and it is one of the best new products around just minutes makes a pitcher of tea that tastes like it has steeped for hours i buy this product on subscribe and save which is cheaper than walmart and keep it all year round thanks amazon for a wonderful product and the convenience of having it delivered to my door
positive,8/11/19,i ve always been a little curious about barley tea as i see it often mentioned in manga and japanese stories i finally got a chance to try it the other day with the sokenbicha brand this tea is not sweetened which is part of the reason i purchased it i m on a diet so i prefer to sweeten my beverages with stuff like splenda or equal i didn t really need it with this drink there s a slight bitter tea taste but it s definitely not overwhelming and i didn t really think that it deterred from the drink to be honest i didn t add any sweetener to it at all it didn t need it and i think it would have killed the taste there s a great nutty ish type of flavor that i m going to assume is the barley i adore it and while i don t think i d be able to drink it constantly i really want to drink this again to the point where i d be willing to drive to the organic grocery store that s about a half hour out of my way i do have to warn you if you are a fan of the more traditional teas black tea iced tea etc then this will take some getting used to it s tasty but i can see where it wouldn t be to all tastes still very much worth trying and i m definitely going to be looking for barley tea in general but stuff like this is good for me to take to work where i can t brew up big batches of tea
positive,25/10/21,i am so impressed this is the best price i have ever seen for this product the quality is awesome and they had it shipped to me so fast that i had it within a week fantastic price quality and service don t get no better than that my husband and i are hooked this is delicious after eating this you will never go back to rolled processed minute oatmeal
positive,8/5/20,i like this so much that i use it in most of the foods that need a pork flavor i have even used it in home made baked beans
positive,28/9/18,this lo carb pancake mix is really good and easy to make you can t even tell it s a lo carb product i made some pancakes with it and give one to my boyfriend he couldn t even tell it was a lo carb product i would buy this again
positive,29/7/19,i love this tea its got a great taste and doesn t leave you all jumpy and wired after you drink it the only thing i have against this tea is that it is cut very small small enough to drift out of my infuser and leave a bunch of loose tea in my tea
positive,9/3/18,not only is this tea delicious but it s organic and very cheap i ve bought rooibos from over other stores and it has never been this cheap or this good davidson s for the win
positive,18/5/18,we have been paying big bucks for little cans of rooibos tea at the health food store and brewing ice tea with it that we drink by the gallon i was surprised that the davidson s rooibos was richer and tastier and brewed up a nice clear amber brown color better quality and less expensive
positive,17/5/20,cranberry grape xs has a wonderful taste and helps give me energy for my daily workouts with out the crash effect later in the day xs unlike other energy drinks balances out the day
positive,26/3/20,these almonds deliver the crunch of freshness that i love in nuts some nuts you can tell are old because of their softness but these almonds are incredible and tasty great for a quick pick me up
positive,24/2/20,these are one my favorite kind of sun chips they have a zesty taste that is not too sharp or bland with just the right kick and a nice crisp texture while these are not a health food their sodium and fat content is much better than other snack foods these chips work really well with a dip and vegetables for a pre dinner snack shop for price the price printed on the oz bag that i buy at my local supermarket is and i pay less on sale so the price on amazon is higher than the manufacturer s suggested retail price
positive,3/5/19,this is very tasty good deal to save a few bucks here on amazon as well i find this dish very similar to the chicken tikka masala both are great obviously this curry dish has more curry flavor than the chicken tikka masala the chicken in this dish is wonderful as well
positive,27/3/20,generally speaking i really like mini wheats so this cereal was appealing to me already i enjoyed the flavor very much since it didn t taste artificial i also liked the fact that it contains brown rice syrup in it instead of corn syrup it gives it a different flavor that enhances the cinnamon and combines very well with the wheat my active teen daughter is a big breakfast eater and if she eats cereal she s usually hungry within a couple of hours this kind held her for hours it is hard to measure pieces serving size so we just served about a cup which is a little more than what the average cereal calls for overall the cereal tasted good and was good for the tummy i m looking forward to buying some more
positive,31/12/20,these are moist soft and chewy with a really nice texture the cinnamon flavor is really good nice and strong i love cinnamon and really natural tasting not artificial like a lot of cinnamon flavors they are a little on the small side like or bites but also pretty low cal cals so they make a nice snack or light breakfast i will definitely be buying these again
positive,13/1/20,we love making special coffees and this just added a great touch to them also we have put it on top of our soy ice cream and found it to have a nice taste on that as well oh we have also added it to our soda making vanilla coke vanilla dr pepper and vanilla orange soda very very nice
positive,21/9/20,i m pretty new to the coffee scene but i really like this roast it is quite flavorful and rich it was the first coffee i bought i tried a few more and i came back to this
positive,2/12/20,i have a weak spot for grape soda among other not so good for you treats admittedly i don t pay that much attention to what goes into them but i do try to moderate what i consume from time to time this stuff is great tastes almost as deliciously bad for you as the real thing but since it s not as syrupy as welch s grape soda it actually is more refreshing after downing the whole can if you re concerned with all the bad stuff in the other stuff but can t keep away give this one a try
positive,20/11/19,great carbonated beverage my son gets it at school and loves it i can t find in local stores so i bought it here kids love it
positive,2/12/20,purchased this water at first due to the fact i needed the water bottle to fit into a drink holder case it was a win win situation because it tasted great too
positive,11/12/19,fantastic espresso beans i usually drink illy but thought i would give this a shot and i was not disappointed this has a slightly smokier flavor than the illy roasts produces a nice crema and is ultra smooth in short give this a try highly recommended for my fellow coffee heads out there
positive,20/11/19,i have had it with brisket turkey and chicken fingers it is great on everything just the right amount of kick it is hard to describe sweet but spicey my kids love it their ages are nine to nineteen
positive,28/6/20,arrived room temperature but i knew that would happen given the other reviews i figured they were probably ok still and ate them they taste good and i didn t get sick so i think that it is fine i would purchase again once i run out
positive,8/8/20,i bought this because i thought it was the same as white sweet potato flour i was disappointed but then after i baked cookies w it they were actually good gluten free egg free dairy free will taste great though if you added eggs i thought i d share my recipe cup sweet potato flour cup canola oil or safflower cup honey cup water or any other non dairy milk substitute a dash of salt tb baking powder optional chocolate chip cookies shredded coconut and or almond pieces or any other nuts mix everything and roll into small balls flatten on cookie sheet covered with baking sheet bake for minutes or til firm they burn easily so watch
positive,14/7/21,the ambrosoli honees energy plus vitamin caramels were absolutely delicious you definitely get a caramel taste without the stickiness i can t speak to the vitamin aspect but it does give you a little energy shake up i kept a pack in my purse and during long tiring speeches i sneaked one and it kept me awake the wrappers are noisy but worth it
positive,2/12/20,we drink a lot of iced tea in the summer and this is a nice change to put in the rotation so there is a little variety
positive,20/11/19,this is a very tasty ready to eat indian meal the curry is especially delicious i will likely buy again
positive,1/3/21,i have been drinking folgers colombian coffee since i first moved to the us over years ago i tried some of the other mass produced coffees first but couldn t find one that i liked i was thrilled to find this one it tastes perfect to me i had stopped buying it when the price in my local supermarket kept creeping up so i was really happy to find it on amazon subscribe and save cheaper than my local supermarket that is an added bonus the only reason that i gave it four stars is that there are better coffees out there in my opinion just not for the same price
positive,5/5/21,nice aromas wonderful exotic taste definately for people who like to sample exotic cuisines reminds me of being in southeast asia love it
positive,2/12/20,i purchased this for one brother on the recommendation of my oldest brother and i could not locate the brand anywhere in my local area so just hoping by chance amazon would have this item i scroll through and bingo the projected delivery date was not going to arrive in time for thanksgiving so i was told but it arrived within two business days my family was very delighted to say the least
positive,20/11/19,i drink crystal light like it was water this is a good flavor when you want to break out of the ordinary berry orange grape etc it is not too tart like lemonade can be nor too bitter as pomegrante can be i do not drink this flavor every day but it is a nice change from my regular flavors
positive,9/10/21,this particular flavor is almost impossible to find and in my opinion it is one of the best i was very happy to find it on amazon what can t you find on amazon this flavor is tart and refreshing just right for arizona summers where i happen to live it is not even halfway through june and the temps are triple digits thank goodness for this wonderful drink which also keeps me hydrated just mix with water and you are good to go
positive,6/3/21,for whatever reason my local grocer does not carry cinnamon toast crunch i was happy to find it here on amazon the bags of cereal in this box are nice and large this has lasted about as long as regular boxes of cereal and we still have some left i was skeptical about buying cereal this way but it turned out to be a pretty good deal after all
positive,12/2/21,very hot but smooth great consistancy for use with most korean cusine just a dab will do you don t want too much this items is tasty but extremely hot great side with most korean dishes
positive,2/12/20,crystal light mocktails appletini tastes great it s like drinking a jones soda green apple but without all the carbonation or calories my only issue is that they use aspartame with all the dangers that come with it it d be nice if they use stevia instead other than that if you re looking for a great apple tasting diet beverage this is pretty good
positive,20/11/19,this is a tad better to me than the mojito flavor it s final mix is a translucent green it s not too sweet but doesn t have that totally artificial tasting twang to it either i would definitely buy on my own
positive,25/6/21,i d seen an add for these in a magazine recently but my local grocery store hasn t had them in stock so i was really glad to get the chance to try the appletini flavor out it s delicious while it certainly doesn t taste like the real thing it s got a nice light flavor that is different from all the other powdered drink mixes out there also a few reviewers mentioned that it tastes a bit like a jolly rancher in its sourness but i don t think that it s sour at all i try not to drink more than one glass of crystal light a day because i worry about the aspartame in it which this one also has overall a really tasty drink i m eager to try to mojito one next
positive,17/3/20,i love the sauce with steak i haven t tried using it with anything suggested on the bottle yet with a nice filet though delicious
positive,20/10/21,pretty good sampling of their standard flavors i believe the only flavors missing are the ham ones gravy ham and ham cheese which i d love to try the bacon flavor is good but the bacon is a little odd cheddar cheese is the best and butter is good too plus each pack per box is only calories good for a warm snack when you re feeling nibbly my only real complaint is that i d rather they ditched the original flavor and replaced it with something more interesting
positive,21/7/20,these are really good and healthy use the subscribe save option because you can always have them skip a shipment or cancel whenever watch the price though as it fluctuates greatly i paid for mine including shipping with subscribe save
positive,22/2/21,very tasty snack i have re ordered this item twice already too bad the price increased since my last order though
positive,8/6/21,this is a very good mix at a reasonable price i snack on trail mix at work and put of these out in the snack area with the standard pretzels and candy my fellow employees must have liked since it was gone within a day
positive,2/12/20,ordered this as a healthy snack and everyone seems to like it around my household the packaging wasn t the best so one bag ripped open during shipment other than that it s all good
positive,20/11/19,these mints are tasty with a nice kick i can t chew gum due to jaw pain and really enjoy a mint after eating to freshen up my breath after realizing that many mints contain aspartame which i m trying to avoid these days i searched and found these to my delight i haven t seen them in stores so i ll be ordering other flavors in the future online
positive,25/1/21,pros this cereal is great tasting fills you up new box color not like in the picture yellow is a good color protien i am eating it while i type this review cons small ounce boxes how long will that last you do not have any you have to spend money on this when its gone you become very sad your always wanting more but have to wait for the next order stars out of
positive,1/7/21,found these at meijer s couldn t wait to try them i think these are better than the regular chocolate ones a much better chocolate flavor love them will be buying these instead of the other ones
positive,30/9/20,this is the cake part you need to add your own amaretto to it and it really beats making your own
positive,15/3/20,this is as good as you can get in a commercial product if you like a rich caponata you ll like this product
positive,6/7/21,i wanted something simply convenient to mix up with the spring water hot tap caffe d vita fits the bill i like the pumpkin spice flavor as well as the oz size it is great for a little pick me up on a chilly day
positive,29/6/21,falling asleep in class staying up late for that end of the year project coffee machine broken or too expensive jolt energy gum gives you energy quickly with a great taste and at a great price you can t always drink coffee but you can always have a piece of gum i d recommend this product to anyone and everyone i gave out packs of this to a lot of my friends at the end of last semester before finals
positive,29/6/21,i ordered the pack maybe i just got lucky but i had an excellent variety i have different kinds doubles of the majority with one flavor i got there were probably decafs they were thrown into the box but none were damaged overall i m happy and i ll probably order again
positive,26/7/21,i bought big hunks when i came across them in retail stores which wasn t very often when i did find them they were usually kind of stale from sitting there for a while i came across this offer on amazon and was impressed with the price so placed an order the box arrived quickly and i was very happy to discover how fresh the candy turned out to be if you like fresh nougat you will probably be very happy with this item
positive,21/10/21,this a a very tasty product and it makes all beat product taste good i have been a fan of kraft barbecue sauce for years but i just decide to try this brand bulls s eye i am glad i did and i will be switching to this brand from now on
positive,25/10/21,i love arizona iced tea and this one is quite tasty especially for a diet version a great combination of lemony tea please note that this review is specific to the product not the price or the merchant
positive,5/7/21,tried this per package directions adding smoked sausage and cut up chicken tenders wow was it ever good i liked it so much that i immediately came back for another case in the event that this product might be out in the future if you are a fan of jambalya you will love this spicy but not overpowering made a huge amount three of us had dinner with grandson going back for seconds and there was still plenty for the next day for lunch what is so great about this is that you can add anything you want to it and it would be great or fix it as is and still be happy try it
positive,17/9/21,my husband bought this after growing to love this dish after living back east we currently live in the western us and i have never had this dish prior to him making it for me so i cannot offer any comparison however i do thoroughly enjoy this dish when my husband called this cincinnati chili i got stuck on the chili part so my taste buds were confused when i first tried this dish because it doesn t particularly taste like the chili i am used to after adjusting to the sweetness i really enjoy this dish more than my husband it is not your typical chili with beans and spicy ness it has a smoother consistency and the cinnamon cloves and allspice give it a different taste entirely it is a very easy meal to make we have it way on top of noodles with grated cheese and chopped onions on top i should also mention to others not familiar with this dish is that it is not very substantial on its own it is also delicious on top of turkey dogs
positive,18/8/21,i wanted to try cherrytree cola for no particular reason other than i d heard fentimans makes some pretty good drinks so i ordered a few from amazon and they shipped in like three days i absolutely love this soda i don t drink much pop because the carbonation is overbearing for me but this was different it was much smoother than regular colas and had a great taste the only downside is that it s expensive i won t be purchasing more right away but if i could i would
positive,31/7/21,i ve loved these since i was a kid my mom has been giving them to me for christmas ever since i discovered them perfect amount of orange flavor blended in with delicious dark chocolate i had my boyfriend try these recently as well he loves them too he has a mild milk allergy so he sometimes can t eat certain brands but these don t bother him
positive,18/10/21,having a peanut allergic son this stuff makes a great substitute texture wise it is exactly like peanut butter but with a slight cinnamon after taste quite pleasant i found it in walmart for under a jar so i would suggest shopping around some i bought the creamy version but a crunchy version was also available also much more cost friendly then the peanut free almond butter that was to be found for like jar
positive,29/6/21,this is by far the best deal going for oh henry bars that i ve found anywhere either online or in retail stores an entire pack for under is truly a great bargain and i found the quality and freshness of the bars to be quite good very satisfied with the purchase and i will be re ordering when this box has been devoured
positive,16/9/21,these sugar free sour gummi worms are wonderful the taste is just like that of the regular sour gummi worms the only problem with them is that they did not come with a suggested serving size as you may or may not know if you eat too much of these or most sugar free products there may be unintended consequences limit to at a time or you may find yourself limited to the bathroom other than that they are great
positive,24/8/21,i ve had instant and canned teas in the past and was less than impressed with those products so i was hoping for something better with the mio sweet tea at first i got the mixture wrong i put tsp into ounces of water there was too much of a citrus like after taste and of course the flavor in general was too strong once i got the mixture right use tsp for every oz my opinion changed the flavor is great and i love it the servings of this product were gone in no time as i made ounce servings frequently i imagine the liquid would easily stain clothing so be careful as you squirt it out but otherwise i have no reservations in recommending this
positive,24/6/21,the sweet tea flavor is very tasty and refreshing without any added sugar or calories it is very conveniently packaged for use away from home as well i just pop it in my purse and i m good to go i get to control how much flavor is added according to my taste and mood because it is a liquid there is no concern with additive powders that don t dissolve properly i m a fan
positive,27/9/21,my wife and i absolutely love these snacks they re somewhat healthy and they re very tasty after we purchased these we found them cheaper at wal mart since then though wal mart went with a cheaper clone from another company it comes in a plastic container has the exact same ingredients and the price is a lot less than the name brand item
positive,29/6/21,these noodles are very tasty and light not fried or greasy lots of vegies a great lunch to go that won t fatten me up love them
positive,5/8/21,so often in the movies when something upsetting happens the first thing offered is a cup of tea there s just something soothing about it i m no connoisseur but i decided to branch out and try something a little exotic i m glad i did as this tea is really nice i like mine with a little honey and milk so good
positive,29/6/21,i bought this after my local coffee house went out of business and it helped me so much with the transition to a coffee free world the mocha mix has a lot of sugar and ingredients i d rather not have on a daily basis but oh it tastes wonderful so for an occasional treat it s awesome i add a small amount to a healthier protein shake and it makes for a great desert
positive,31/7/21,i personally use it to make iced tea it tastes great with a little sweetner tha acai is not overpowering as in other teas i ve tried
positive,11/9/21,a nice little break from the traditional chocolate mint andes candy the cherry jubilee is not too sweet it s just right package wise i always look at the weight of the candy and not the packaging can t go wrong with andes it s an office favorite with our software developers
positive,12/8/21,fruit flavored mentos are a delicious candy the flavor is teriffic although there are several different colors they all taste a bit the same to me which is a general fruit flavor i also really enjoy the texture as well these mints are chewy on the inside but on the outside they have a bit of soft crunchy she will
positive,31/7/20,i purchased these to add drops of lemon juice to my water they re great i gave it stars because i don t really have anything else to compare it to
positive,13/6/20,i think the negative reviews are a little harsh this company is not alone in labeling their almonds raw even though they are most likely pasteurized is it right i agree no but when it comes to almond butter no matter what your choices are going to be either organic or not so at least you know they are being grown healthier than the alternative all almonds in the united states are pasteurized you can go to health food co oop store and most likely find imported raw almonds my store has some from italy but if you go to whole foods they are also going to try and sell you raw almonds that are not truly raw everyone seems to be in on the mislabeling anyway google it and get educated if your interested if you are looking for a great tasting organic almond butter at decent price you won t be disappointed with this one as i scanned the negative reviews i don t think i remember them commenting that the taste wasn t great for what s it s worth i tried vitamixing my imported truly raw almonds to make my own almond butter but still doesn t taste as good as this
positive,17/10/20,i live in texas while visiting our daughter in sd recently she purchased these at her local grocery store she served as salad topping but then we ate a couple of packages by the handfuls i went back the next morning on our way back home and purchased all they had in the maple and cinnamon flavors i emailed the company and asked where i could buy more locally texas they advised that this is a new product and only available to date in the midwest basically but that i could order through amazon i am thrilled these are fantastic a little on the expensive side but just learn to pace yourself and not eat too many maple is our favorite cinnamon is good too haven t tried banana flavor enjoy
positive,14/12/20,i was introduced to a peach flavored iced latte at work and decided i wanted to try and made them at home this syrup worked great highly recommended
positive,29/5/20,i love the flavor of this tea even though it is decaffeinated it is one of the few decaf teas that still have a good robust taste this and the irish breakfast decaf are among my favorites
positive,9/12/20,these are good each roll is only calories with g of sugars they are similar in consistency to a rice cake but slightly firmer due to the rice syrup i think they taste sweeter than the g of sugars they contain but not so sweet that you d consider them candy or junk they come packaged rolls to a box because they re not individually wrapped they can stick to one another in the package although not to the extent that they re destroyed also because there is no wrapper although they are a decent snack for kids they tend to leave little hands sticky this order was for a dozen boxes these are certainly good enough to order more than once but i imagine it will take some time to get through the initial order a box option might be better
positive,4/8/20,i love peanut butter but occasionally have allergic reactions after eating it so i avoid it when possible i first purchased sunbutter after seeing it on qvc and boy was it wonderful i purchased it several times through qvc until they quit carrying it fortunately i was able to purchase it again through amazon the pleasant smooth nutty flavor will keep me coming back for more
positive,31/7/20,this nustevia product is the best i have ever tried there is no bitter taste it is very sweet and only takes a few drops on a previous review i spoke about another product and how tasty it was however this one beats it by a long shot i highly recommend it i am glad i tried this one
positive,13/6/20,no aftertaste isn t overpowering doesn t mask the flavor of the food we use this on our steel cut oats and protein drinks no bitter aftertaste like the powders
positive,21/11/20,i made the first loaf of this on a quick setting on my bread machine and it didn t rise very high i thought it was the bread mix and wasn t very happy with it but i decided to give it another try on the regular cycle i added a tablespoon of molasses because we like it in rye bread the loaf turned out beautiful rose very high and tasted delicious very pleased with the results
positive,25/5/21,this product tastes just like any other cinnamon bun i was skeptic at first but the taste is very good everybody at home liked them at g net carbs it is a treat you can afford in your coffee break in your low carb lifestyle
positive,25/5/21,my wife and i love this coffee the taste is awesome the hint of mocha makes the coffee sooo smooth
positive,20/1/21,i love sahale snacks and this one hits the mark it s got a little kick that is very satisfying one thing that separates sahale from other snack products is the variety of textures and flavors you get in every bite i highly recommend sing buri blend
positive,15/1/21,this is really just some good clean tasting hearty tomato sauce the fact that it is organic is important to me and it is also bpa free so if you are concerned do not be top notch product in my opinion and one that i use at least twice a week in pasta and on pizzas the s s price in particular blows away normal grocer prices for this same can size enjoy
positive,10/2/21,this is the best cold tea i ve ever had it really works and has a great flavor it gets rid of your cough and makes your throat feel better i have strep right now and this stuff works better than dayquil and doesn t have any side effects

positive,1/11/20,this nori is a true bargain sheets of nori at local grocery stores ran for as much as per sheet sheets at less than is hard to beat really glad i got this as i am now making sushi several times a week
positive,14/1/21,this nori tastes great at an affordable price this was the best price i have ever seen for a pack this size
positive,6/6/21,i have never used a coffee syrup but love starbucks and though why not see how close i can get to that wonderful taste i used this torani hazelnut syrup just a small amount in most of my different flavors coffee it is sweet so you don t need any added sugar good price shipping was high but would buy again might try a different flavor
positive,21/7/20,i must confess that i bought this product only because i wanted to see the pretty flower blossom inside the water to my surprise it smells and tastes really good too and the flower is very pretty totally worth it

positive,1/1/21,this is a great product if you like a touch of hot on your pasta we first purchased it about years ago when we were in myrtle beach it is hard to find where we live my husband will not eat his pasta withot this i also put a few shakes of it in my sauce when i am cooking it in this quantity it only flavors the sauce and does not make it hot to taste the biggest problem is that it is not often available i wish amazon would stock it on a regulary basis
positive,11/1/21,i really like the flavor but i don t have much choice anyways not many pizza spices brands out there to buy i used to buy mccourmick but they discontinued their pizza spices i really loved their hot version but i do like this pizza spice anyways i just sprinkle on top of my pizza slice as i am eating it
positive,31/7/20,i fell in love with this product i find artificial sweeteners sadly lacking in flavor or as stimulating to my taste buds as a flat soda this product has saved me i use it in everything i would use regular sugar for my favorite way to use it is to make lemon sorbet talk about satisfying my sweet tooth and staying within my dietary guidelines this is the one for me now i want to find a brown sugar variation of this raley s supermarket used to carry smart sugar and then quit stocking it i bought every last one on the shelf to tide me over until i could find another source thanks to amazon i can now quit hoarding my supply and use it more freely i ll be placing my order for bags very soon thanks to everyone involved in the production of smart sugar
positive,13/6/20,i have always like sardines and recently decided to start eating them on nearly a daily basis i bought two cases of these season sardines in water and started taking them to work to eat as a snack i really like the taste these came to a can seemed to be of the larger type they still had the skin and bones which was fine by me i love the taste of fish so i didn t have much interest in the skinless and boneless bland tasting ones
positive,14/1/21,i am on my third or fourth bottle am not sure how well the health benefits are working out but i really like it because it adds flavor to different drinks i usually add a little bit to my orange juice or water once a day to give it a nice flavor it probably taste good because it s mostly concentrated pomegranate juice
positive,7/12/20,wonderful packaging small glass containers full of anchovy goodness that you can throw in the frige after extracting what you need clean tiny boned very edible fillets are perfect for anything from sauce to toppings due to other reviews i recommend using the first fillets you pull out from the middle for sauce slightly broken up the the others come out whole just fine with a cocktail fork i will order these again and again
positive,5/5/21,had demitris in a restaurant and now it has become the go to for tailgating and gatherings easy to mix and regulate the spiciness only problem was that amazon s packing when shipping caused one bottle to leak all over the box
positive,23/11/20,bob s red mills lentils are my favorite legume they have a slightly sweet taste and cook very fast minutes be careful not to over cook them because they are very tender and will fall apart still tasty though the soup i make calls for sauteed carrots celery onion add ham or sausage if you wish garlic clove oregano salt if you haven t added salty ham and optional hot pepper flakes it is very hardy and filling caution lentils can be difficult for diabetics to handle
positive,29/8/20,i cannot comment on price because this is not sold locally however i can comment on taste these are so simple to cook and healthy i found a really good lentil soup recipe to use these in
positive,18/6/21,i m a pretty big coffee drinker but had never tried kona coffee before i got to say hawaii roasters kona coffee was the best coffee i ever had the type of coffee you want to savor for the flavor rather than gulp down for the caffeine which is really hard to do because it tastes so good after your first sip you just want to keep downing it rather than savor it i purchased my first package right before the holidays and it was a total hit with my family and friends i am now totally hooked and strongly recommend hawaii roasters kona to all coffee lovers
positive,18/6/21,love this coffee i ve always enjoyed good coffee but this is great coffee a friend sent it to me as a gift and i m so happy he turned me onto it the coffee is strong the way i like it and has a smooth rich flavor i know what i ll be buying for my friends this holiday
positive,7/7/21,this was a gift to our son in law and from what i understand he really enjoyed it rich full bodied flavor
positive,18/6/21,like most coffee drinkers i know kona is a special coffee bean and this brand offers great taste at my local coffee shop i often pick kona when it is offered as the flavor of the day while the coffee shop kona is better than an average coffee it did not seem to be anything special and i could guess they do not sell true kona but a blend so i decided to try a true kona and picked hawaiian roasters i am very happy with this purchase might be the best coffee i have ever had the flavor is strong and there is no after taste issue i picked the medium roast and i plan to try the dark roast next
positive,7/7/21,planter s big nut bars are just that big and full of nuts honey roasted peanuts almonds and cashews i often have issues with this kind of snack since they so often try to position themselves as a healthy choice and they so often are not one aside from calling itself a granola bar this snack does not make any particular health claims yet it actually is a relatively good choice very preferable to a candy bar which is really where these types of snacks belong it contains g of fat but almost none of it g is saturated each bar contains no cholesterol a reasonable mg of sodium and calories while providing g of protein g of fiber calcium iron vitamin e and phosphorous like most of these bars there s quite a lot of sugar but again when compared to other candy bars it s not a bad choice and they easily taste as good as most candy bars i wouldn t hesitate to have one of these as an occasional treat
positive,1/7/21,these bars are pretty tasty as you might imagine they are truly for nut lovers fairly sweet with great nutty flavor it s nice that they don t just use peanuts
positive,7/7/21,these are vaguely like a payday nuts stuck together with chewy sweet goodness and something vaguely like rice crispies in there they are saltier than i expected though i like that i m not seeing a lot of nuts besides the peanuts though and there is more of the cereal stuff than i was expecting i m a big nut eater so i do like these and i like the salty sweet nutty sticky mess but i think i d prefer them w o the cereal filler
positive,23/7/21,i was a little hesitant in trying these triple nut bars since i m not a big fan of almonds however i haven t found all that many almonds in them plenty of honey roasted peanuts and quite a large amount of broken up cashews i love these i eat them slowly to savor the flavor because they really are good these granola bars are a little larger in size than the standard long by wide by thick just salty enough to make them delicious and sticky enough so it doesn t break apart when biting into one yet not so sticky that you have to wash your hands after eating i will definitely buy these again
positive,20/7/21,these are a tasty treat but i would not eat one everyday i like all nuts in bar honey roasted peanuts almonds and cashews i like them separately but having them together blended really nicely i was surprised i was very impressed with the size of the bar compared to other bars they are a generous size i think i will be buying them in the near future great taste and fair size update march i liked these so much i bought more they are not healthy for you but are very tasty i try to eat one every few days
positive,19/7/21,i like how this bar taste is soft not like other peanut bars that you are afraid that every single bite will hurt i like the flavor of the honey roasted peanuts almonds and cashews combination this bar is delicious
positive,18/6/21,i am a long time diabetic and always looking for a sweet treat without all the sugar i ve always enjoyed haribo gummies so i tried their sugar free version and wow you can t tell the difference they are still sweet and fruity and smell just the same as a matter of fact so good me kids ate almost all them not many candies i enjoy that are sugar free but these are the ticket
positive,7/7/21,i am loving this coconut oil it s a difficult thing to find in stores and i ve been searching for a good alternative to cooking with olive oil since it has such a low smoke point all the other sites i found it was too expensive so i tried this and have replaced it as my only cooking oil it s light and flavorful and has a lot of health benefits to go with it
positive,27/6/21,we buy this product to keep us healthier it has a healing property of keeping bacteria at bay especially during the winter months
positive,21/7/21,first i ordered a case of loma linda vege burger it was disappointing a whoooole case of disappointing i thought that my memories from youth of how good canned vegeburger had been must have been overblown then i tried this worthington vegetarian burger this is exactly what i remembered the big problem is i can t stop eating it i love eating it straight out of the can the texture is great the flavor is great it crumbles nicely easy to use calories are moderate as well good imitation meats help me resist eating the real thing and this product is perfect for me
positive,18/6/21,i use to grab my coffees at local stores now do all my coffee shopping here because of price and quanity my wife loves the flavor of this coffee and swears by it i bought the kurig and have to say for time saving and convience it s the best out there it s also the only one that allows you to brew your on blends also try paul newmans organic blend that s my brew
positive,7/7/21,in my opinion the dha soymilks always taste the best and are the most creamy doesn t hurt that they are healthy too i usually drink silk brain bone health soymilk at home but was looking for smaller containers to bring to work i tried the zensoy cappuccino flavor and was pleasantly surprised it s very delicious and is a nice change from plain soymilk
positive,30/6/21,i was weary of buy food through the mail this was a great purchase great taste and great price i will be looking for other great deals
positive,1/7/21,we re so happy we tried this if you love red lobster biscuits these are the ticket i highly recommend this product wow what a find yummy
positive,24/8/21,i am new to bread making and this was the third loaf of bread i made in my machine toasted with butter this bread is superior to anything i ve ever tasted it is the reason i bought a bread making machine
positive,21/7/21,i have tried other brand of oils but this is the best by far as it makes the popcorn taste better and it is easy to use i always said popcorn will taste great with all the right ingredients
positive,25/6/21,so far this is the best affordable coffee we found in the us before we had coffee bean direct sumatra mandheling whole bean coffee pound bag which we didn t like at all but it still doesn t reach the coffee we had in europe
positive,13/9/21,i do not drink much caffeine so i need my spearmint leaves to be pure and not cut with other teas this brand delivers my first order was for packages and i have just completed an order for more for those of you that want a good refreshing spearmint tea i encourage you to give this brand a try
positive,18/6/21,tasty stuff no complaints other than i wish you could pick amongst the selections and perhaps avoid the peppered flavored one in favor of a different one
positive,7/7/21,if you like sriracha this is definitely the cost effective way to order it with free shipping from amazon prime each of these oz bottles actually costs a little less than the oz bottles from the store
positive,15/7/21,i purchased these cracker chips at walmart twice and now i can t find them and they have no idea what i am talking about love them and have some coupons but can t find them now i will continure to look trying to be healthy and these are great

positive,6/7/21,this isn t as hot as some of the hot sauces i have tried however this one has the best taste for the scovel units so this is the best bang for the heat and flavor combined you will not find anything hotter with this kind of flavor great stuff
positive,18/6/21,i was purchasing nutritional yeast at whole foods but the cost was too high bob s red mill makes a great nutritional yeast and the price is right
positive,7/7/21,this product does taste like sugar the only reason i gave it stars is the price it really is very expensive so i keep trying other sugar substitutes to see if i could find a cheaper alternative so far i haven t found anything that is close to this there s no after taste but start off using only a little because you might get stomach upset diarrhea then increase little by little so your system has time to get use to it
positive,27/7/21,i use this tea mostly for making large pitchers of iced tea mix in a little mint and chamomile and you have a mocktail that can t be beat
positive,13/7/21,this is the best black tea i ve ever had that came out of a teabag it has a distinct and rich tangy flavor that is almost reminiscent of an expensive bourbon most other brands seem highly unsatisfactory after getting used to this delicious tea so i plan to keep some around all the time it s a little expensive but nowhere near as expensive as going to a cafe or tea house to get a great cup of tea
positive,13/9/21,i got this tea a few days ago and it has great taste has a mild citrus taste love love love will come back in weeks to review the weight loss aspect as today is my first day update almost weeks later i am still totally in love with this tea and i actually noticed that it suppresses appetite great i have been losing weight but i can t totally attribute it to this tea as i have also been exercising more but the appetite suppression is a great attribute for me

positive,17/4/21,both my husband and year old have a gluten allergy we have tried other products and found that these taste the best for animal crackers it s not grainy or taste funny like another reviewer stated it taste more like a butter cookie yummy not sure why anyone would rate it one star i understand personal preference to taste and texture like one reviewer but the other reviewer just seemed to be on a rant we have been pleased with this product and highly recommend it to others who are looking for a tasty gluten free snack

positive,10/3/21,the dogs loved them i ll certainly order these again they re wholesome and not made in china which is very important
positive,14/1/21,i was hesitant buying so much of this before i had even tasted it but it has a great flavor which is really all you can expect from an energy gel in my opinion i had previously only bought the orange flavor so now i have a new flavor that i can depend on
positive,24/5/21,i ve never needed to use these for energy as i never feel drained but my brother recommended them saying he takes one before and every half hour of his runs i still haven t noticed a difference but when i start running over miles maybe i ll need it
positive,14/10/21,but i ran out and now i see that the price has increased from to while it is still i m sure a good deal that s a sharp increase
positive,7/2/21,i just got my first case and let it get cold in the fridge for a couple days drank my first bottle tonight and let me tell you it tastes like water i didn t detect any dirty taste or even an aftertaste i don t understand what people are saying it tastes funky because all i drink is water and milk this tastes like my bottled regular water i m going to switch to bottles of blk water a day and see if it really makes me feel any better and energized
positive,29/3/21,i do not know what everyone is freaking out about it tastes like slightly salty smart water the color is a little unnerving at first looks like rust water a friend of nutrition major likes the idea of it so i can t be that bad maybe
positive,17/4/21,very tasty crackers especially for gf not many crackers in the box but if you re buying gf products you probably already know that my whole family likes them i bought a couple of cases last time to save money on shipping fyi they make a great substitute for bread crumbs in meatloaf and parmasean chicken
positive,10/3/21,these vegetable flavored crackers are a pleasant surprise for those of us who are gluten sensitive they have an almost pizza like fragrance and taste very nice indeed as a veteran of sampling rice crackers cakes etc as well as crackers of other grains i must say this glutino texture is much preferable to the hard crackle rice flour gives to crackers and too the flavor is quite good i have subscribed to have them delivered as a result
positive,10/7/21,this is our favorite jerk sauce and it was sent correctly and speedily by the merchyant so all is well
positive,27/1/21,i actually loved this flavor i bought one of each of argo tea flavors from my local store i liked this one the most i am not sure what kind of tastes the other two reviewers have but i am amazed that they hated it so much the mint and lime mix together wonderfully it might even mix well with gin i noticed the mint flavor at first followed by a tart lime flavor at the end i will be buying more according to the bottle its made with armeniam mint tea not black tea as one of the reviewers noted
positive,1/6/21,my sister was sick with terminal cancer and was suffering from a poor appetite she had this juice in the hospital and liked it it was not available for sale locally i emailed apple and eve and they very nicely responded that it was available from amazon i ordered it and it was delivered promptly to her house
positive,20/8/21,this is a very good tasting salt especially on freshly popped popcorn i use it in everything i no longer use the regular table salt becuase this just really enhances food without the metallic taste of table salt or the somtimes to salty taste table salt has you will think your food was prepared by a fine dine chef buy a non corrosive grinder to use this salt and you will never use table salt again
positive,14/8/21,good overall oil for salads cooking etc we have benn buying it from on amazon for a couple of years now and are on auto ordering which is even a little cheaper making it a great deal

positive,10/3/21,i have been using walden farms products since the company came to north america and they are a regular part of my shopping list their pancake syrup is thick and fantastic this is so versatile and great on salmon maple glazed chicken turkey etc in chili and stews instead of molasses great in butternut carrot pumpkin pureed soups in milkshakes on toast french toast biscuits bread puddings or breakfast bakes on eggs pancakes high fiber cereal in puddings hot and cold cereals desserts ice cream souffles and in steamed milk and hot coffee this is great on waffles or to bake with great for cakes muffins etc i love pouring it on top of crumb cakes and letting it soak in i especially love mixing it into greek yogurt or cottage cheese adding it to pumpkin puree with some cinnamon pumpkin pie spice and sweetener makes it tastes like pumpkin pie in a bowl but healthy great way to have flavor without the added sugar
positive,22/4/21,this is such a good tasting syrup that when they stop selling it in the nc stores i seek amazon and is very impressed with the price
positive,25/4/21,the first time i ate it i didn t realize that the beans sunk to the very bottom so when i was almost done all i had left were a bunch of beans from then on i made sure to stir it up occasionally and really enjoyed the mixture of vegetables
positive,1/4/21,when i decided to become veggie my boyfriend frowned he figured that we d be giving up on all these foods that he likes i made these sloppy joes for him though and he couldn t even tell the difference we re talking about a guy who likens eating vegetables to having teeth pulled i figure that he if he can eat them and ask for them again anybody would like them
positive,30/6/21,pro this coffee is great it is one of the better ones i have tried and i have tried over brands overall i would give it a rating from to would highly recommend con i feel it is a bit pricey
positive,1/3/21,i liked the size of the mini fingers walker s shortbread though not more than one or two bites for each one they r mighty tasty
positive,29/1/21,it s hard to describe this to people who have never sampled it but basically it s a powder to which you mix milk and sugar to get a sweetened malted drink it is supposed to promote sleep quite simply it s a comfort drink when plain milk just won t do you can also call it malted milk or a hot sweet malt drink in the great british trifecta of british powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar horlicks the most malty milo is medium chocolately and malty and ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately it s actually named after the inventor william horlick as far as taste goes you can make it as malty or sweet as you like depending on how much of each you add to the milk but to those who love and grew up on holicks it s just a great comfort drink
positive,17/4/21,this is a great tasting hot drink it is not chocolate base like milo or ovaltine when added to milk the color of the milk barely changes it gives the milk a smooth texture and a creamy taste i mix tbs with warm milk sometimes i use sugar and sometime i don t without sugar added it still has a good taste the only thing is the g container is very small i was expecting something a little bigger for if i knew g was so small in size i would have order the larger size here is the nutritional fact base on serving g calories sodium mg total fat g potassium mg saturated g total carbs g polyunsaturated g dietary fiber g monounsaturated g sugars g trans g protein g cholesterol mg vitamin a calcium vitamin c iron
positive,10/3/21,this is a very welcome product it is so difficult today to find any candies that are made without gmo s having said that i must also say that i was astounded at the price listed i purchased these candies in a local supermarket for a bag that is three not thirty when you add shipping unreal s website lists many stores that will soon be carrying these products they are great everyday type candies i would recommend to anyone but not at the price listed
positive,30/5/21,this is the best kcup ever it is fantastic sweet it doesn t have to much caffine but just enough the flavor is fantastic great price
positive,28/9/21,these are by no means low cal but they have g protein and taste really good better than a lot of the vitamin tasting bars i ve had they are huge so i half it and eat one half now and the other later on or another day i m eager to try the triple chocolate flavor the sugar grams is per bar that s why i only eat half at a time fiber is just grams per bar
positive,6/5/21,i got these and another brand at the same time i far preferred the taste of this pouch than the other brand my daughters love these snacks and i love how easy they are to just grab when in a hurry i m also excited to pack them when we go on picnics my year old and my month old are able to slurp these up in just seconds but they enjoy each and every second of it i am curious though if anyone knows are these pouches bpa free everything else about them is so good that i would hope they would be but it doesn t say it anywhere on them so my assumption would be that they are not bpa free otherwise that would be a high marketing point
positive,20/4/21,i love this water it s liquid gold i bought ten cases a year ago and have been giving bottles of trivedi water as gifts to family and friends since then it makes a wonderful gift each person has had their unique experience with it i m thrilled it s available on amazon now i can use it and share it more freely i ve used trivedi water on plants with great success most recently i started using it on my skin wow it s clearing up acne and revitalizing my skin in a way i couldn t have imagined truly amazing and in terms of drinking trivedi water the taste is indescribable the closest i could say is that it tastes like pure water from a mountain stream fresh clear and vital with a quality of softness to it it quenches some taste or thirst that is deeply satisfying try it
positive,20/4/21,i would like to share with you who are contemplating mr trivedi s products i was diagnosed with are rare form of acid reflux i was advised not to drink anything carbonated and a whole list of no no s about months ago i found out about this incredible water since then that is all i drink i had the most amazing results not only easing my acid reflux but also drinking the water brings a sense of calmness and almost at the same time a felling of complete happiness and tolerance of which i am not especially noted for at the retreat one of the wonderful staff members remembered me from the center in soho she remarked how different and calmer i was compared to months ago i know there will always be skeptics i am ready for them thank you mr trivedi

positive,22/5/21,i love how these mints taste compared to the classic peppermint flavor which i used before they are a bit less strong and spicy they taste very sweet and still give off a great minty scent and they don t get the horrible sour aftertaste that classic altoids do i love these mints
positive,19/7/21,the regular shirmp noddle soup s taste is very good and this spicy srimp flavour has a better taste i like it
positive,7/9/21,very well balanced flavor with no after taste syrup does have the tendency to drip down the side while pouring so you may want to get a pump
positive,25/8/21,amazing coconut flavor and very easy to make this was the th flavor i ve made and all came out better then expected
positive,6/9/21,this product has a kick to it which you cannot usually find with other hot mustard brands but pay attention the jars are very small

positive,5/9/21,i think these are delicious they taste like chocolate and are not too sweet my boys love them with a cold glass of milk we ordered them about a couple of months ago and still have some so you get plenty for your money i would recommend them to a friend and i m planning on trying the cinnamon ones too
positive,25/5/21,i can t go back to any other mashed potatoes after eating these i would honestly prefer these over real mashed potatoes they are so creamy and just seems to have a nice balance of everything that comes together to make a great texture and taste had these for thanksgiving dinner and several people wanted to know my recipe for the mashed potatoes ha honest earth can t be beat
positive,7/9/21,pleasant fresh tasting coconut smells good when you open the bag and smells good a week later when i finish it
positive,11/9/21,i am very happy to have found this product it adds so much flavor to many dishes i am very pleased with it
positive,13/7/21,the jerky has a plesant taste not overly fishy some of the pieces were highly seasoned some of the pieces were signifigantly drier than others but overall i recommend the product
positive,22/7/21,this has a great taste is good on mufins or toast also great on vanilla ice cream excellent will buy again
positive,22/6/21,i tried couple of green tea but i like this green tea very much great taste sweet smell will order more soon
positive,28/7/21,i drink a lot of teas and tisanes so i like to try different kinds from time to time i ve been drinking this for a few weeks and it s fantastic even before i brewed this i knew it was going to be good just from the aroma actually it would make a great potpourri on its own it brews up a nice deep color with a good flavor i highly recommend this
positive,13/10/21,a good for you whole grain that also tastes great you can also grind the grain in a coffee or spice grinder for millet flour
positive,19/2/21,received package in a timely manner and in acceptable condition the rice is excellent and offers a wonderful alternative to white rice
positive,14/12/20,everyone likes frooties these are a bit harder than the others that i have bought so be prepared to workout your jaws with that said i do not think they are stale or anything just a bit tough on the bite
positive,14/12/20,we found this at pf changs and it tastes just as great as it did there there are bags per box as listed
positive,19/2/21,these are absolutely great freeze pops especially if you like anything that s a little sour these are very unique and certainly worth trying
positive,10/1/21,my family likes sour items so be forewarned it is definitely sour but the flavors are so very good i have had other otter pops and as you suck on them the flavor gets sucked out and you are left with an unflavored chunk of ice but these are definitely not like that great product and the only way i can find them is here on amazon because i am to isolated to find them in stores
positive,26/3/21,caused a fight over who was getting what lol perfect gift and have told many others to check out this box and the others they have available very quick delivery
positive,24/3/21,i ve been drinking peppermint tea for about year in fact my family used to grow and harvest peppermint tea from our own patch to me this tea tastes great and has a good minty kick to it i d certainly purchase this again i use a little mesh tea ball infuser and pack it full regardless of the size cup i use at this moment i am drinking a oz cup and the strength is good i declare this a phenomenal value
positive,24/2/21,although this is no substitute for the real thing the flavor is good enough when you need a substitute
positive,19/2/21,these work great with s mores i was so shocked they are a little thicker and not as cloyingly sweet as non gluten free grahams but i found that refreshing because they are thicker they stand up to smushing the marshmallow and chocolate in between each cracker better than regular grahams which can fall apart i d highly recommend
positive,14/12/20,i have not yet tried these crackers with s mores but they are very good with any kind of frosting especially cream cheese frosting a nice quick treat that is gluten free
positive,19/10/21,mmm this boxed macaroni and cheese kit is great the cheese sauce is smooth and creamy and there is just enough ro tel included to give the mac some kick without making it runny as a bonus it only takes about mins to prepare note the ro tel isn t mixed in with the cheese sauce so you can add as much or as little of the tomato sauce as you d like to the mac or just skip it and use it in another dish you could just add the tomato sauce to your portion if the kiddies don t like tomatoes note one box only makes servings unless you have tiny eaters try it
positive,18/5/21,these are wonderful they have a great light sweetness and real chocolate flavor their consistency is that of hard candy not like a melty chocolate just what i wanted i keep them in my bag and use them to stave off afternoon munchies great for diabetics and hypoglycemics
positive,19/2/21,i love indian food and this is a great way to get great tasting indian food quickly and easily the aloo palak tastes amazing and it is so easy to prepare especially when i don t feel like cooking just take the package out and heat it in the microwave the pouches are usually good for two people and taste great with rice also the aloo palak is a tiny bit spicy which i love but know some people can t handle
positive,14/12/20,i bought this for my girl friend that recently went through gastric bypass and she s a pretty picky person when it comes to food and surprisingly she loves the product and drinks like shakes everyday
positive,1/4/21,you have created a product which is low in fat and calories and high in taste thank you for the bulk pack
positive,15/4/21,i purchased this based on the hugely positive reviews and for the promise of having a tasty alternative to regular peanut butter i was amazed at how good it was definitely buying this again
positive,19/5/21,i bought this product because i am on a medically supervised liquid diet this product was recommended for adding low calorie low fat flavor to the shakes i am drinking it is very tasty and adds great flavor i have heard that you can add water and make a sort of peanut butter but i have not tried that i think it would also be excellent in baked goods too this product also comes in a chocolate flavor which is very good also
positive,19/2/21,i am kind of a noodle bowl connoisseur i ve eaten lots of different ones at lunch over the years the flavor of these bowls are noticeably better than other brands needless to say i am a big fan the bowls have enough food to fill me up fine but probably won t satisfy my husband also its not very spicy i always end up adding a good amount of sriracha but that s just me i recommend
positive,28/7/21,first let me state that i do not enjoy drinking soymilk i buy this for my son for traveling and out and about that being said when i tasted this brand it was actually good it has a nice sweet vanilla y flavor without the almost bitter taste that most soymilk has
positive,29/6/21,this black walnut has excellent flavor my ice cream was wonderful i was unable to locate this in any stores i also purchased the bourbon vanilla waiting to try that the ingredients were simple water alcohol black walnut
positive,15/10/21,i first purchased these at an area supermarket and fell in love with them right away very pleasant taste and perfect blend of spices if you enjoy cool ranch doritos then i think you ll enjoy these chips i do not eat gluten free foods exclusively however these are the only chips i eat
positive,20/7/21,these chips are fantastic they have just the right amount of spice and crispness these are probably my favorite chip on the market
positive,12/10/21,i use this as one of my herbal teas on the hcg protocol it s smooth and tastes good no noticable side effects would recommend i v drank almost half the box now and i actually brew it in my coffee maker in the mornings wonderful will repurchase shipping fast and item as described
positive,19/2/21,this is great for graham cracker crust i made a cheesecake and my gluten eating husband raved about it can t wait to make another pie with it
positive,14/12/20,on a whim because i was out of salad dressing i decided to give this a try being calorie free and sugar free i didn t hold much hope for this but i can say that it is incredible i use it in tuna on salads salmon and as a marinate with some balsamic vinegar i love to really dress my salads so now i can do it guilt free
positive,2/7/21,a bit pricey but has a great taste love it in my tea and i use it in my deep conditioners for my hair
positive,11/3/21,i decided to try raw honey about a year ago and was a bit overwhelmed with all the choices i ended up at my local health food store and found stakich raw honey it is produced about an hour from me so given the speculation that raw honey from flora in your area helps with allergies and liking to support local businesses i decided to give it a try i love it the taste is delicious and sweet i ve used it to replace all of our regular honey uses and no one in my family can tell the difference the texture is definitely more grainy than processed honey but that s to be expected i mix a tablespoon of stakich raw honey and a teaspoon of stakich bee pollen into my greek yogurt each morning and start my day with a nutritious and delicious breakfast try it you won t be disappointed
positive,10/4/21,these chips have so much chile lime flavor it s amazing baked wheat does not have as many calories as regular chips and not greasy at all i live in hawaii and the stores do not stock them here so i have to order from amazon thank god for amazon
positive,22/7/19,i grew up eating red vines and i liked them very much but it s been ages and ages since i ve eaten licorice i don t why i do eat candy on occasion but licorice i just stopped eating until last week when i tried these they do kind of remind me of red vines the flavor is different of course then i remember these are pomegranate flavored but it s been ages and ages plus years since i ve eaten a pomegranate so i can t swear that they ve gotten the flavor right but that being said these are very tasty
positive,2/2/20,these naturally flavored twists are healthier and tastier than the more popular type out there on the market which taste like plastic i was hoping not to find corn syrup in these twists but these days it is almost impossible to find man made snacks without it ingredients organic wheat flour organic sugar corn syrup organic tapioca syrup vegetable glycerin sunflower oil elderberry extract citric acid natural flavor pomegranite juice concentrate licorice root extract made in mexico so much for being newman s own
positive,2/2/20,i really like this licorice it has a great flavor does it taste like pomegranate i don t really know what a pomegranate is supposed to taste like so can t really answer if that s the flavor i m tasting but if you re looking for a licorice with a nice berry flavor that doesn t turn your tongue colors this is it i also like that it s from newman s own i always purchase their products as i know it s going towards charity
positive,31/8/19,i have never tried the similar candies before so maybe i have nothing to compare these with but i really enjoyed them it is not too sweet and just has a pleasant taste overall i think i will be buying these candies for myself in the future i tried newman s own other products and i am happy that this one has not dissappointed me
positive,22/7/19,this licorice is addictive the taste is original and fresh what i love the best is the after taste it leaves you wanting more a winner
positive,12/1/20,i am already a fan of newman s own organics line of products i think they are generally high quality reasonably priced and have a great track record as a charitable organization so i was really looking forward to trying out the pomegranate licorice when you first open the package you can immediately smell the sweet sugary fruit scent of pomegranate the next thing you notice is the rich red well pomegranate color one thing i liked right off the bat is that the licorice sticks are not super long like a twizzler they are shorter and more manageable to eat they are a also not overly sticky and do not leave a sticky residue on your fingers taste wise they are great perhaps my favorite aspect of this licorice is that they are not super sweet while they have a strong sugary smell they are not obnoxiously sweet like twizzlers the licorice has a nice chewy texture and trends towards soft the pomegranate taste is subtle at first you cannot taste it at all instead tasting the sugar and gelatin flavors as you chew the pomegranate taste grows and by the end has a nice strong flavor the pomegranate flavor is also very good i haven t ate too many raw pomegranates but i do like the pom juice products this licorice compares well against the pom juice products so as a nice treat to share with the family i highly recommend
positive,19/2/20,i d been reading about this product in magazines for almost a year and couldn t wait to try it i finally got to and it did not disappoint pomegranate is not an easy flavor to capture and somehow they were able to i have tried all the newman s own organics licorices and this was the hardest in terms of chewing but it was not overly hard i have had some that i know would put any dental work at risk and this is a good option if you like slighly harder licorice but still want something that is chewy not too sweet but good if you need a candy fix and of course it s got all natural ingredients so you can get your candy fix as i have been doing without feeling in the least bit guilty
positive,27/11/19,newman s own organics licorice twists have a lot of things going for them percent organic with no artificial ingredients the pomegranate flavor was surprisingly good and while it had a different consistency from the twizzlers i m used to it wasn t a bad change recommended
positive,12/12/19,well licorice is a stretch but this is like most of the newman products tasty and good quality whether you like the taste is of course up to you but i did
positive,26/9/20,this licorice has a very good flavor the only thing i would have liked is it were a little softer
positive,22/7/19,we enjoyed our package of pomegranate licorice i prefer to buy organic and this fits the bill it s not too sweet but yet still is candy the entire family enjoyed it and it was a nice special treat if you are looking for a nice treat that is not too sweet and sugary this works i would prefer that they didn t use corn syrup but it is candy
positive,2/2/20,my husband loves his florida orange blossom honey he was delighted when i found it through amazon now he does not have to wait for care packages from his brother who lives in orlando pros real florida orange blossom honey price quick shipping cons none
positive,23/5/20,this can be mixed with virtually any wine i ve had it mixed with champagne riesling and moscato and it works well with them all the price is rather steep as i paid at a local gift shop
positive,22/11/20,i have to quit drinking coffee as i have horrible caffiene reactions i love the taste of coffee though i ve tried hazelnut and mocha so far and both are tasty hazelnut has a bit stronger flavor but mocha is good too even my kids liked it when they tasted it i think its a great alternative and better for you
positive,30/3/20,i love this stuff you can make it with milk or almond milk and put some whipped cream on top it s amazing you can also blend it with ice to get a frap style drink
positive,8/7/20,great taste and texture especially considering it s sugar free oz is a perfect size to have it finished in on seating
positive,4/1/20,i switched to green tea several years ago after reading about the health benefits of green tea vs regular brewed tea after trying many different brands i settled on celestial seasonings green tea because of its rich tea flavor finding it on amazon was a plus i now have it on auto ship and never run out of tea
positive,30/1/21,my son gobbled this down right away i was looking for different flavors since they only hold so many in the stores texture is fine what else can i say tastes good to me too
positive,2/11/20,this is a great tasting product it doesn t have any sugar it flows just like honey
positive,17/10/20,these pepper flakes have a rich slightly acidic flavor and not a lot of heat they have a slightly moist consistency not sure if that will affect shelf life shipping was fast but overly expensive
positive,22/7/19,these are the best tasting of the crown prince offerings for sardines in olive oil
positive,2/2/20,i love them and cannot find them in stores around here so was happy to find them on amazon better than just a salad topper i crush them and add the to rice for flavor plus use them as a crumb topping on many dishes
positive,4/10/20,this mint is very minty it has a stronger mint flavor than the one with sugar only problem it isn t carried by my local stores
positive,1/4/20,the molasses dominates the mix and the chipotle doesn t assert itself as much as i would have liked but all in all it is a passable barbecue sauce it goes especially well mixed into a pot of baked beans
positive,8/5/20,this tea has a wonderful flavor the price is right and i love that they do not use staples on the bags i can just throw the used ones right into the compost pit jasmine and green tea were meant to be together
positive,18/6/20,i actually have tried four flavors to date of the di vinci syrups i like them all i use them in baking you can find some recipes on the internet for using these syrups in things like muffins etc be aware that these syrups are made with splenda we love splenda use it everyday so we re ok with it some folks have a problem with it though currently in my pantry i have strawberry i suggest using this over some low fat frozen yogurt or ice cream vanilla peanut butter and pancake syrup all four taste great the consistency of the pancake syrup is thinner than you might want however i bought it because my local store did not have syrup made with splenda at the time now they do though the price listed here is good i ve paid per bottle at an online retailer
positive,1/6/21,i stopped in the cayman islands and fell in love with this rum cake it makes a great gift too
positive,4/7/21,tasty moist not too sweet just perfect it its true rumcake the taste of rum is minimul however it is there just enough
positive,5/2/20,i m french and moved to usa in i miss many of the good foods i have in france the ricola herbal tea is one of them i m glad to discover recently that amazon sells it it might be the only place in usa that sells it it is calming soothing and taste good it is good when you are thirsty right before going to bed when you are sick and when you have a throat ache
positive,22/7/19,i don t generally care too much for the healthy alternatives especially when it comes to coffee however after trying truvia at a hotel i am now hooked i usually get it at the grocery store but it is good to see that it is available on amazon and now that i have prime i might just be getting it online instead this sweetener tastes really good and in addition to coffee i have had it with desserts and it tastes great i think it even tastes better than sugar and definitely tastes better than splenda i cannot comment as to the health aspects related to artificial sweeteners but i m sure that there is plenty of information available on the internet related to that as a casual coffee drinker i highly recommend truvia however definitely try out a sample before purchasing such a large box
positive,2/2/20,these are fantastic i ve gone through about bags in the last couple months try putting out a bowl of these rather than pretzels or chips they ve got a hint of saltiness to them so they go great with beer the bulk box of bags is also the most economical purchase i ve found
positive,22/11/20,didn t know what to expect when i ordered this product but was pleasantly surprised about how good it is and the value definitely will buy again
positive,1/3/20,finally i found a whole bag of only grape jolly ranchers they are delicious and have been rather popular in my candy jar in my office lots of thieving coworkers for or these and cherry was a bit steep but i think i m ahead in the end for not throwing away all the undesired flavors in the multi flavor bags
positive,23/11/20,i bought these for my husband it s almost impossible to find sugarless black licorice in stores he s thrilled with these fast shipping highly recommend
positive,5/4/21,although it s low acid it s still good tasting and it does not because me heartburn i no longer have to take prilosec daily i would definitely order some more of this coffee i receommend it to fellow heartburn sufferrers
positive,27/4/20,i like the coconut oil very much it taste good i add it to my food everyday will buy again
positive,8/3/21,i couldn t be happier i was worried the expiration date would be a problem nope march of i was worried the milk would taste funny nope it s the best milk i ve ever had thanks for offering this at a great price
positive,30/1/20,great product easy to have on hand my year old thinks it s fun to have a milk box
positive,22/7/19,love the fact that i finally found organic sunflower seeds i toast them with just a hint of sea salt
positive,2/2/20,for a low gluten product this stuff is very good it holds up well in liquid doesn t get all mushy i like the bits of dried fruit i add stevia for sweetness
positive,2/9/20,great jam spicey crisp just a little sweet maybe not the best for breakfast but perfect for afternoon tea
positive,26/1/21,simply put this tea is delicious the mango taste is smooth and not overwhelming and all the ingredients are blended well so nothing is overpowering i also like the fact that numi did not pump tons of sugar into the tea to make it overly sweet thereby cutting down on calories carbs and sugar as the label indicates this is barely sweetened but it tastes just right there are also little gems of wisdom underneath the bottle caps i can t wait to try every flavor in this line of puerh teas in the glass bottle i did not order the tea through amazon rather i got it directly through the numi tea website but wanted to give a review here for others
positive,9/1/21,these taste great i add or cubes to the water when cooking quinoa or lentils and it really adds a nice depth of flavor i use them often
positive,30/7/21,these pancakes get my highest rating for gluten free pancakes they taste almost identical to bisquick pancakes they are so yummy i ll never make gf pancakes from scratch again
positive,30/10/20,i started drinking the blueberry hibiscus tea because i read that hibiscus helps to reduce blood pressure i have never been a hot tea drinker until about a month ago it did take me a few cups to get used to the taste now i really enjoy the taste i even miss it when i skip my nightly cup i find it also relaxes me before bed it is sweet enough that there is no need to add honey or other sweetener the blueberry is an added bonus i am willing to pay the steep price because i am trying to find something beside prescription medication to help control my out of control blood pressure the price on amazon is a bit higher than at whole foods where i shop
positive,3/8/20,in the great trifecta of british powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar horlicks the most malty milo is medium chocolately and malty and ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately all are basically comfort drinks when plain milk just won t do all are powders to which you add milk and sugar to get a sweet malty drink the latter two with chocolate flavor as well i love all drinks but if you are drinking this for nostalgia s sake make sure you get the milo from where ever your nostalgia springs from because milo is made in different countries and they all taste a little different for me i love milo for it s good mix of chocolate and malt not too much of either and a great comfort drink for cold nights
positive,29/1/21,not the sweetest chickpeas i ve ever had but close enough nice flavor and texture very fresh no old beans cooked up great very pleased
positive,24/10/21,reese s sugar free peanut butter cups taste just like the regular ones plus they are lower in sugars and are healthier great prices on amazon too
positive,24/10/21,my daughter really likes th ave candy bars and they are hard to find in our area amazon has them and they came quickly thanks for the good service
positive,16/10/21,this was one of the first k cup boxes i bought was not disappointed it tastes great like coffee is supposed to not too strong not too weak great flavor will be buying more

positive,19/10/21,i really enjoy these bars i usually will have to of bar at a time gives me energy until next meal love the taste and crunch
positive,20/10/21,interesting concept very tasty too i used the chocolate pb in my vanilla ice cream and it was a lean alternative to flavored syrups i purchased these products to cut down on the fat from regular peanut butter i would order it again although it is a bit pricey
positive,19/10/21,first of all i just want to say that i hate lollipops and i do mean hate even dumdums seem to taste really artificial and just like colored sugar i got these originally because i was intrigued by the organic label i love that you can actually understand what s in these items and they have a video showing it being made great unique taste as well definitely well worth the price my family and friends love it the assortment is great and they actually taste like different things rather than a lot of candy that s out there
positive,15/6/21,i bought this to share with my co workers and in one week they are gone
positive,4/8/21,these lollipops are a wonderfully healthy option over regular store brand suckers lollipops my children and i are very happy with the taste of these the flavors we have tried so far are tasty and strong and the size is perfect for a special treat the pound bag should last us a very long time
positive,4/8/21,these are the best lollipops i ve ever had sadly they are not available via amazon directly at the moment so no guaranteed flavor ratios the bag i got was strawberry smash tart sour apple googly grape tooberry blueberry wet faced watermelon mango tango pomegranate pucker very very cherry mango no tango was only one of the colors so a total of pretty close to as advertised i was surprisingly fond of flavors such as the strawberry and watermelon which i generally don t like in other candies artificially flavored ones however the blueberry and mango fell a bit flat in general though these are the best approximations to real fruit flavors i ve come across in hard candy before hope the trick or treaters enjoy them as well
positive,18/7/21,a great little candy tastes good really fruity and not too sugary my yo son loves them allergic to wheat and dairy
positive,18/10/21,i purchased these as a nice treat for our children i try not to buy foods with artificial colors or flavors so when i saw these we tried them all the kids and adults like them i will certainly buy them again
positive,15/6/21,my kids love these and like a lot of reviewers have said they don t have corn syrup or chemical artificial sweeteners in them it s still candy but treat wise it s a treat i don t mind my kids having in moderation
positive,4/8/21,i just finished brewing a container of this tea to keep in the fridge i pre sweetened it with some simple syrup making it less sweet than most restaurants serve it as i don t care for super sweet tea i m not a connoisseur but this tastes very similar to the teas i have had in restaurants i do wish there was no artificial food coloring yellow
positive,8/6/21,if you like the ceylon tea variety you will certainly enjoy and appreciate this tea in the years we have been drinking ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed the superb quality of ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years have always used loose tea but this time wanted to try their teabags because of the convenience portability and to see if the bagged tea would brew as clear as the loose tea and i am happy to report that it actually does i am so glad to find ahmad teas available here because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away the current prime deal for the pack of is superb much cheaper than i can find locally i m taking advantage of the subscribe and save offer the six tea boxes arrived nicely packed see the photos i uploaded each box has a packing date and a best before date this is a great tasting tea which i am happy to recommend
positive,15/6/21,i ve been eating boboli for years what can i say it s really the perfect pizza crust not too fluffy not too flat great taste great price i like this much better than the crust in a can varieties boboli s been around for years now for a very good reason they gave us a great product that has withstood the test of time and at a reasonable price to boot i usually brush mine with melted butter with a hint of garlic for added tastiness pile on the boboli sauce a ton of cheese and your favorite toppings and you have a home run for the whole family highest recommendations
positive,4/8/21,my sister and i both loved the taste of this caramel taste and very sticky also both of us ordered more hardest problem is not eating the whole bag contents at one time
positive,25/9/21,these are tasty but really sweet i didn t notice they made my blood sugar stable any longer than any other bar i might buy them again if the price was right
positive,19/10/21,tasty coffee works well in drip coffee maker smooth taste and nice flavor remember it s preground so don t expect fresh ground recently roasted bean taste but it s a lot more convenient
positive,4/9/21,i just made myself a cup of this coffee and i think i found a new favorite brand when i opened the bag i noticed the pleasant vanilla aroma which wasn t too sweet and overpowering like other brands i used my french press to brew the coffee which i wouldn t recommend the grounds are extra fine and the filter doesn t completely seperate the liquid from the grounds i mixed the finished cup of coffee with some milk and it tasted just like flavored vanilla coffee but without the syrup or sugar i really liked the taste it was mild but without any traces of bitterness definitely a good alternative to my usual starbucks coffee
positive,31/8/21,easy to use and nice tast you can add ice cream it will be great taste
positive,9/10/21,i have tried a number of senseo pods and this is my favorite it is very smooth it tastes like coffee from a coffee house rather than a senseo
positive,15/6/21,with it s own typical strong taste like taster s choice also but this one surely tastes better with little quantity you can make it taste from mild to strong
positive,4/8/21,this was a great product and easy to use i am now to fonadant decorating and it was tricky to learn how to get it on the cake but after the second attempt i got it and it was amazing and it did have a nice sweet taste and was easy enough for a beginner to use everyone loved the cake that i made
positive,15/6/21,these are very tasty and you can find these udon noodles at most stores i really like the flavoring and this is my favorite flavor
positive,4/8/21,i ve been eating this stuff for years it was super simple to prepare as a college student and has a long shelf life now as a mother my year old son loves it and he s usually picky note that my son only eats the mild version of this sauce i mix it with steamed white rice or steamed quinoa both ways are fab but of course it s healthier with quinoa it s cheaper at the local asian market but if you don t have those nearby i guess this is the next best place to stock up
positive,15/6/21,we really like this peanut butter the taste is great as my kids do not eat the completely natural peanut butter with only peanuts and salt i don t care for it much either this is a nice in between that i feel is pretty healthy we get this auto shipped by amazon for convenience and price we go through a lot of pbjs for kids school lunches and i eat quite a few of them too
positive,4/8/21,i have very picky eaters in my house and this peanut butter is really great tasting and healthier too after learning about transfats and really fealing guilty giving my kids pb j sandwiches in their lunch with not so healthy peanut butter i decided to try this one and really love it thanks skippy you did it right
positive,1/10/21,because my job involves talking all day and i am constantly surrounded by allergins i go through cough drops like mad the way i see it if you are going to consume something you might as well enjoy it ambrosoli honeeenergy plus more than fills the bill i found it to be very soothing but also had a strong honey flavor that i absolutely loved the very best review i can offer for this product i am about to order it again and will be back for more
positive,1/7/18,i got them in a clear plastic bag but how do you think they look before they are packaged they were fresh and salty yummy
positive,10/8/18,i like these little cheese chips they satisfy my craving for something crunchy and who doesn t like that last little bit of crispy cheese from your toasted cheese sandwich that s what these are like just beware i didn t notice right away that one bag held four servings not just one they are pretty rich so it would be hard to eat the whole bag but i could see munching on half of the bag which would be calories

positive,13/9/18,when summer comes i am constantly drinking ice tea last summer i was told to stay away from caffeinated beverages what was i going to do without my ice tea i looked in amazon com and wow amazon had lipton tea bags and they were decaffeinated i was saved i ordered some and i have been enjoying my ice tea ever since
positive,17/7/18,love this product do not like diet drinks but this one is very good without the after taste that aspartame leaves i add more water then the directions give and like it better this way

positive,1/8/20,while i don t like this as well as rose s lime marmalade and can t help wondering why the lemon lime actually looks greener than the straight lime it still makes a tasty spread
positive,1/7/18,great gluten free licorice treats but must be eaten fresh otherwise they get stale fast
positive,10/8/18,i got a snow cone maker for christmas and was psyched i tried a cone with orange soda and was disgusted with the result but finally i tried these flavors they are amazing blue raspberry was by far the best with grape being the second best i recommend this to every one it is sooooooooo good
positive,15/2/20,i have used this chocolate drink previously and i love the cocoa flavor that it has and it does suppress my appetite while providing a little boost of energy it does give you a huge jolt which is great because by the end of the day i am able to get a good night s sleep if hot chocolate is a thumbs up to you then you will love this drink plus its benefits
positive,22/4/21,if you enjoy a bowl of ramen noodle soup but are looking for something healthier this is for you i just whipped up some of this with tofu and veggies yeterday just make sure not to overcook it because it ll be less tasty
positive,25/9/20,that s what i thought when i took the first bite i found these on an amazon manager s special for slightly less than box and the ingredients were healthy and intriguing with the seed combination and two of my favorites rosemary and garlic since there were no reviews i didn t really know what to expect but i had to give these a try first of all they are very fresh crunchy the sell by date is months away they re cute little round crackers really tortilla chips as a tortilla chip these are the best i ve ever had they are very sturdy you could use them to scoop anything including the thickest guacamole and i don t think they would break or crumble the delicious taste i got from the first one with all of the nuances of every flavor unfortunately diminishes where the rosemary and garlic isn t really discernible but you still get that wonderful corn organic seeds flavor with just the right amount of salt way lower than most with mg i don t know if that is considered a low sodium product but many snacks and processed foods like most jerky and a lot of crackers are way too salty for me fyi nutrition info serving size oz about crackers g servings box calories total fat g saturated fat g no trans fat cholesterol total carbs g fiber g sugars protein g sodium g by the way they are gluten free which is really important for a lot of people most of the crackers in the box i opened were intact with a few broken ones mostly at the bottom of the bag even though they are perfect on their own they would be really good with a black bean dip guacamole or hummus bottom line if you re looking for a tasty and healthy snack cracker chip these are for you
positive,16/11/19,i orderd a case when the last grocery store i knew about quit carrying the product it is a very good olive spread makes a very tasty and reasonable calorie snack however two of the six jars had leaked and the lids were not sucked in i called the company and they credited my account immediately they get an a for customer service
positive,9/9/20,gave only starts because recently amazon sent me a batch that was tough and hard to chew into but the product itself is great if shipped fresh the fresh ones last for a couple of months but if you get a hard batch recommend getting replacements because they are really hard to bite into and sometimes i feel like my teeth may fall out trying to rip into the hard pieces
positive,1/7/18,iv been eating fruit leather for over years this is my favorite flavor buying in bulk is the way to go and they are very reasonable here
positive,10/8/18,these are a tasty item and a great value i would say they are becoming a staple at our household i wish the raspberry flavor was a bit more pronounced but they are very fruity not artificial tasting nice short ingredient list too
positive,1/9/20,these sugar free russell stover cinnamon bun snack bars didn t last long here if i had not known they were sugar free i d never have guessed it the bars have a good cinnamon taste to them with some crunch and also are a bit chewy which i like they do taste like a cinnamon bun in bar form and are a good size for a snack the bottom is covered with chocolate and finishes off the bar so that it tastes more like a candy bar than a sugar free snack bar each bar has only calories russell stover makes several other kinds of snack bars and food items that are sugar free and i intend to sample a lot more of them highly recommend
positive,22/7/21,we ve tried several different brands of couscous this is our favorite it s a healthy choice that tastes great
positive,1/7/18,i purchased this product because i like to have a little protein in me before my morning walk it is delicious
positive,10/8/18,i do not like protein at all not protein bars not protein in my shakes i just don t like the taste these bars taste great i was hesistant to get them because i was afraid they would taste like the protein i hate but they are great i like these better than the cereal bars
positive,14/5/21,so far the best decaf coffee i have tasted just leaves me wondering why no local grocery store carries it
positive,17/10/19,this pasta is truly one of the best organic whole wheat pastas out there it does not taste as heavy or fibery as the other brands it comes as close to white pasta as you can get i second the other reviewer who warns not to overcook it as it easily falls apart
positive,15/9/20,if you like black tea this is excellent i bought it because i tried it at bigby coffee and loved it it is worth the price
positive,30/8/20,the peanut butter cookie is excelent in taste just about the right amount of things added to give it the proper taste not too strong but just right

positive,21/10/19,these cookies really satisfy my hunger for chocolate they are not too sweet yet have an intense chocolate flavor without the high calories of a candy bar they are great
positive,8/9/20,i have been taking this for many years and love it the taste isn t bad at all though if you are used to having your protein drink sweetened with a lot of sugar or other sweetener you will be disappointed as this does not taste like a mcdonald s milk shake but the taste is fine it is hard to underestimate the nutritional value of this product as in addition to grams of vegan protein it is loaded with other healthful nutrients each scoop has a pound of dried fruit and a pound of dried vegetables in it plus a vitamin complex and enzymes if you are looking for a really excellent vegan protein this is the ticket plus it serves as a meal replacement and a multi vitamin
positive,22/9/21,love this cereal great taste and doesn t get soggy this is my favorite of all the kashi cereals and subscribe and save makes it super convenient
positive,2/10/20,my kids love these and i love giving them a treat that is not full of artificial junk i have also tried them and they are very good
positive,25/7/20,i don t know how oats could vary considering they are just one ingredient but these are the best tastiest and perfect texture i thought i was crazy for thinking they tasted better than other easier to locate brands but then i read the other reviews and realized these oats really are the best
positive,4/7/21,these are awesome and well packaged shipped promptly at a fair price couldn t be happier
positive,11/9/21,this is my favorite of the or blends offered by emerald can only seem to find it at amazon since the local grocers seem to sell out of it right away or do not carry it will definitely be ordering this on a regular basis
positive,4/7/21,this product is so fantastic the smoked salt is a perfect flavor for so many foods my entire family loves cooking with this salt and we have a bottle of it on the table for personal use too it s not too salty at all it just adds a touch of saltiness and a wonderful smokiness to any dish it s great on meats potatoes with cheddar cheese eggs it s a healthy alternative to bacon it is so versatile it s amazing this purchase is also a great deal you get jars for a great price we love it and plan to continue to purchase this product so we ll never have to be without it again
positive,21/9/21,i contacted the seller regarding the best type the raw or liquid type for baking and they recommended the raw type i was disappointed with the results since then i tried this in iced tea and again was disappointed i had to continually stir the contents of a large pitcher because the honey sunk to the bottom the taste of the honey never diminished but it was a pain in the neck to do the stirring every time i wanted a glass of iced tea next time i will buy the regular honey
positive,11/9/21,i bought this for a gift for my father and he loved it the only down side is the price i will only get these as gifts and not as a food staple due to the cost
positive,12/10/21,this tea taste better iced than it does warm i add stevia to it and it taste really good
positive,11/10/21,great tasting peanut butter a little thick for spreading on bread but if you are careful you can smooth it without messing up the bread worth it though
positive,28/9/21,the peanut butter was very fresh tasting the peanut chunks just as advertised were big the price was great the shipping was fast lot easier to order on line than go to the store
positive,19/10/21,i st seen these on shark tank and what drew me to them was they were made for a diabetic by a diabetic i decided to try a box and i can truly say they do taste good they do fulfill that sweet satisfaction you look for i m not a big fan on granola bars but i think i can get use to these they are also healthy can t go wrong with that
positive,4/7/21,these are a great snack they are filling and healthy for you my year old even loves them
positive,11/9/21,i recently purchased this product and got a chance to try it out on some freshly popped popcorn i was surprised this was so tasty it has a mildly tangy white cheddar flavor that s not too overpowering this makes it easty to create a flavorful savory snack without the extra calories as compared to potato chips or cheese crackers for instance i hope to try the other flavors really soon
positive,12/9/21,this is the only kind of seasoning i use for my soy tacos i stopped buying the del taco flavoring when i read that it contains message just to give you an idea of my tastes i loved the del taco seasonings so simply organic is a great alternative that tastes just as good without the side effects of message
positive,13/7/21,great spice and i use it almost every day on all kinds of things it is a large container but given how much flavor it adds i think that it probably is a good thing that i bought this much
positive,23/10/21,i bought this tea for a diet i was going to start and find it very good i drink it everyday now
positive,22/9/21,i needed to fill a giant pepper mill i didn t know if this package would be enough i had leftovers
positive,4/7/21,i m not an expert on macaroni cheese from a box i love the real thing but it is time consuming i ve tried kraft macaroni cheese but i wasn t impressed i read the good reviews for this annie s product i wanted to get the subscription to save money but packets was too many to buy when i didn t even know if i would like it i went to walmarts and was lucky to get a packet they didn t have many i just compared the prices in walmart it costs a box on amazon with the subscription a box costs that s a big saving i made it yesterday and mixed in a little grated mature cheddar after it was cooked then put it under the grill to melt the cheese i was going to eat half and heat the rest up today it was quite a lot for one person it tasted so good i ended eating all of it if you like mature cheddar you ll probably like this it is great with ketchup on or slices of tomatoes added with the cheddar before grilling it it tastes almost as good as the reat thing i ordered it on subscription yesterday i can t wait to try it again
positive,11/9/21,i drink lots of tea and i must say that this is a pretty enjoyable variety the flavor is deep and hearty and creates a nice dark brew my parents thought that it was a bit too strong but i think that it is right on although one teabag can be used to make several perfectly good cups of tea if you re looking to try something new i would definitely recommend that you give this a shot it didn t totally blow me away so i can t give it stars some loose tea not in bags that i have tried has been more flavorful so that s why this gets a solid
positive,8/8/21,cardboard box is a bit shoddy but the candies are perfect taste great just as i remember them flavors is kind of lacking but so what
positive,9/7/21,easy to make great organic maple sugar and oats fantastic flavor even my teenage daughter loves this single serving oatmeal and enjoys it also as a snack after school
positive,24/10/21,dr mcdougall s organic maple brown sugar light oatmeal is a fanatstic healthy way to start your day made from organic oats naturally sweetened this hot cereal is miles ahead of the national brands found in your neighborhood grocery store this oatmeal a delicious whole grain fiber rich way to make breakfast more nutritious in fact dr mcdougall s instant oatmeal is a great light snack anytime of the day given the great deal dr mcdougall s is on amazon com national bargain store brands of instant oatmeal simply cannot compete even in a tight economy very well worth a try highly recommended

positive,11/9/21,we were disappointed when we could no longer obtain violet crumbles in the you s then we discovered the crunchie almost identical but better these bars arrived on time and is perfect condition none of the bars broken and no bloom nice light chocolate covered sea foam in perfect condition
positive,22/6/21,i m not a huge tea drinker coffee every day but i do enjoy black tea earl grey chai tea and this tea is a nice addition i bought it because i d heard good things about it including dr oz recommending it at that point it was a question of which of the many oolongs on amazon do i buy i bought three they are all very similar in flavor require a touch of sweetener for my tastes but are very good they are all a bit subdued in flavor with this one being in the middle i ve had no problems with the bags breaking or tea leaves or dust being everywhere
positive,30/7/21,i ve only used one other stevia product which was very good this is just as good and does not leave any bitter aftertaste in my opinion i only use it in my morning coffee two packets for a oz cup i d definitely buy this product if i wanted to stick with something organic however i personally still prefer splenda whether it s good for me or not
positive,10/7/21,my favorite sweeteners are stevia and agave this organic stevia has a bit of taste of both the main ingredient is agave inulin and then the second one is stevia this makes it really sweet with no aftertaste in fact you can say that it almost has a hint of honey must be the agave inulin it dissolves quickly too a packet equals tsp of sugar i like tsp in my cup of coffe so i use only half a packet at a time it is very good though considering that it is organic and natural the price is slightly above what i would pay but i think it s ok if you re used to buying other products with stevia truvia costs about cents less than this organic stevia at about the same number of packets but truvia is not organic so it depends on what you re looking for
positive,4/7/21,my spouse and i are both using this product and enjoy the slight taste of chocolate it gives the morning coffee
positive,11/9/21,great product tastes great love being able to buy in bulk at a good price rivals generic prices well worth it
positive,20/9/21,i took this stuff on a two week camping trip and had no problems with mess or attracting ants tastes great note that this does not seem to reconstitute into a thick viscus honey like substance my results were much more watery use in place of sugar
positive,13/10/21,this is simply one of the best low calories food out there great taste low calories low sugar high fiber if you want to eat pasta and don t want to rack up the calories one answer fibergourmet
positive,2/8/21,i love this cereal it s sweet without being cloyingly sweet you can eat a bowl and not feel like you ve overdone your sugar ration for the rest of the day we love golden grahams with the plain soy milk unlike other cereals this tastes just the same with regular milk or with soy milk
positive,11/6/21,huge fan of this crystal light flavor i usually find crystal light drink mixes to be rather concentrated so i mix one packet with oz of water and it comes out just right not too sweet the color of the mixed drink is also easy on the eyes it is a pale green color so nothing like the bright red blue purple orange colors that some of the other drink mix flavors will give you
positive,2/8/21,keenan s pistachios are great i love having the no salt option the nuts are fresh with a very good flavor finding a clunker inedible nut in the bag is very rare
positive,18/10/21,was pleasantly surprised they are very good and i don t miss the salt at all would always have to rinse off the salt but no longer
positive,23/7/21,i like the packaging individually wrapped and the taste of the coffee can t find a thing wrong with it
positive,8/7/21,i received a free sample in with an order i d placed on line and thought why not try it only calories and no artificial sweeteners flavors or preservatives oh my i m hooked the grape flavor isn t weak like kool aid it s just right not too tart not too sweet this product also has electrolytes in it so it will help keep my hydrated when i work out
positive,11/6/21,well what kind of review can i write for snack bites i was quite surprised by their taste which is very good i wish they were available in bigger packages otherwise the packaging itself costs more than the bites that s the reason for stars i mean the cellophane costs as much as the meat
positive,25/6/21,grew up with them as a kid in california then disappeared for years found them while in the midwest for business and then on amazon i m very happy to have a breakfast favorite back
positive,2/8/21,i was a little bit uneasy at ordering a plant online but bonsaiboy sent this beautiful cherry tree promptly and it arrived in beautiful condition i will definitely recommend him again
positive,11/6/21,very nice blackberry tea without caffeine the lack of caffeine allows a cup in the evening without interfering with sleep good taste up to the usual lipton quality
positive,9/7/21,i am already a fan buyer of lipton s herbal tea having tried the island mango peach the mandarin orange and blueberry pomegranate i like the fact that the ingredients are natural hibiscus flowers rosehips blackberry blueberry raspberry it s definitely herbal tea there are no actual tea leaves in the ingredients which is why it s caffeine free i also like that lipton uses the least amount of material needed to make the tea bags and they aren t wrapped individually the teas that do so annoy me as wrapped bags are a time waster and a resources waster there s no need to wrap each one i especially like the taste of the tea it has a very nice flavor note i use bags at a time to make a full pitcher of iced tea
positive,22/6/21,i bought this on the recommendation of ruth watson the hotel inspector and i use it in everything frozen vegetables soup meats etc
positive,11/6/21,i purchased this item because of my wheat allergy but it tastes even better than the semolina elbows that i was using it cooks up in minutes and even my husband who has no food allergies loves it
positive,8/7/21,for a time we could not get low carb pasta in our local store so i ordered this it tastes great
positive,28/9/21,these healthy flakes taste very good even though they are low in sugar and high in fiber and nutritional value they do lose their crispiness in a bowl of milk but i either eat fast or snack on the flakes right out of the box these make a great healthy substitute for other wheat flake cereals on the market
positive,23/8/21,this has become our first choice for coffee we have a bed and breakfast and the guest always comment on how good the coffee is great taste with a fantastic price
positive,1/8/21,all of these fruit snacks are large and tasty muscat was a little gross but all in all a great product
positive,16/7/21,these are just too tasty seriously they need to come in a big box like fiddlefaddle i could munch on these all day long i don t get to as my wife and kids keep cleaning out my supplies before i can get to them damn you pm job
positive,2/8/21,a tasty snack but a little too sweet don t leave them in a warm car they get horribly sticky not for someone with braces either
positive,11/6/21,i usually stick to calorie pack snacks but at only calories i thought i d give these a try they are very tasty not too sweet but enough to satisfy my ever present sweet tooth the size of the package is just right for a mid day snack
positive,26/6/21,just the right mix of chocolate caramel and crunchy popcorn very tasty plus the box is separated into calorie packages so you don t sit down and eat the whole box at once
positive,20/8/21,for the price you cannot beet it it is not to sweet but enough to have some flavor and it really does taste like root beere
positive,25/8/21,this is a great calorie snack with great taste and texture amazon delivered a fresh product with an expiration date a year out to the guy who said there are only cookies in a bag that is crazy it is more like cookies per bag maybe more i didn t count them but i wasn t disappointed by it at all
positive,19/10/21,i really liked this a change up from strictly white tea very expensive though so will only order every once in awhile as a treat
positive,2/8/21,izze is probably the best carbonated beverage that money can buy even better than jones soda all of izze s flavors are all natural and taste fantastic i especially love sparkling blackberry it s worth paying more for the quality especially since they have fewer calories than soda and better ingredients very tasty and highly recommended
positive,11/6/21,my son that i bought it for did not like it but i sure did used it in coffee and cocoa unique flavor best to blend a batch before using as it takes some effort to get to dissolve completely without clumping but even the clumps are great tasting
positive,22/10/21,great tasting found the right combo for taste better than eating all that sugar you will not be disappointed with this syrup
positive,6/8/21,eat think smile cinnamon almond granola clusters is a tasty snack that i enjoyed quite a bit it s not exactly health food but i don t think there would be an issue in enjoying this treat in moderation eat think smile cinnamon almond granola clusters are made up of large granola clusters too big to be eaten easily as a breakfast cereal but just the right size for snacking the most obvious ingredients are oats almond bits cocoa and cinnamon neither the cocoa or cinnamon taste is overpowering at all and i found that the combination of these two tastes was much better than i would have expected now as i mentioned above i would not consider this product health food despite the claims on the package about the antioxidant power of the cocoa and cinnamon after all a small serving contains grams of fat and grams of sugar and among the ingredients listed are brown sugar palm oil and evaporated sugar cane juice but as a substitute for more highly processed sweets this will do ok overall i am a fan of eat think smile cinnamon almond granola clusters and would likely buy it in the future
positive,24/6/21,gluten free pasta can be less than acceptable this brand of pasta tastes just like regular pasta even my husband who is not gluten free loves the taste i have tried all the styles of their brown rice pasta excellent
positive,17/4/21,these are delicious and though they have a lot of sugar they also have a lot of vitamin c if you have trouble getting the kids to eat oranges strawberries or anything with vitamin c these can help these sell for a good price too especially with the food discount going on
positive,10/3/21,i have tried many versions of stevia and this one seems to taste the best
positive,21/1/21,i m a newbie when it comes to homemade waffles i purchased a belgian waffle maker through amazon and was looking for a good recipe for the waffles when reading the reviews of the waffle maker so many mentioned this waffle mix that i figured i would give it a try instead of making my own i m so glad i did i used the tip of adding milk instead of water and followed the rest of the directions exactly from start to finish this morning i was enjoying fresh waffles in minutes the taste was restaurant quality and it was easier than i imagined
positive,30/1/21,i wanted something to fill the new flask i just bought so i scoured the whiskey aisle and this product caught my eye boy am i glad it did after one bottle shared with friends over the weekend i am ready for more my new favorite i do admit with others that it is a bit sweet but hey what did you expect from maple syrup try it you won t be disappointed

positive,17/4/21,this was a tasty snack that i enjoyed might be a little to hard for those with teeth problems but otherwise okay oats walnuts and cranberry with a little chocolate is a good combination
positive,10/3/21,purchase from the commissary perfect snack size the combination of the crackers and tuna make very balance protein to carb ratio and total calories are under my calorie per meal eat small meals every hours taste is spicey and yummy without a sauce i tried a different brand and it had a sauce in the tuna yuck not this i also used this to make tuna cakes and did not have to add any seasoning they were such a hit i had to go buy a case from the commissary to share with the ladies group hoping amazon will get it so that i can order it as an automatic subscription even my hubbie that is not a seafood person loves it

positive,17/4/21,fast delivery i like the fact i am getting trace minerals and iodine better than normal table salt also bought the bulk package too
positive,10/3/21,this is a tasty seasoning mix the instructions call for deep frying the chicken but it tastes just as good if you pan fry with minimal oil it is not that spicy so add some pepper sauce if you like it really hot you can probably create this seasoning pretty easily by yourself for less money but the pre mixed packet is nice for lazy people who don t have lots of different ingredients lying around in their kitchen
positive,10/7/21,this is a must have spices are just right a little on the spicy side but not too hot for people that doesn t eat hot spicy foods captures the taste of new orleans i add smoked sausage slices and it everyone loves it

positive,17/4/21,the tanka bars i purchased were moist solid tasty without too much salt or sweetener and a small amount alleviated hunger for several hours at a time as i diabetic type ii i often have hunger pangs throughout the day pieces from one bar provided my body with enough energy to make it dinner time without the need for a sugar lift this helped me maintain a steady blood glucose level all day a little bit goes a long way so it should not be gobbled like an energy bar the taste will tempt you to do so it is pricey but certainly worth it i keep several in my go bag
positive,10/3/21,not sure about how these are priced as i bought them originally at the dollar tree for but it was a package of only oz not the oz available here on amazon the cookies were such a surprise especially coming from the store they were so good i wanted to eat the whole box they are super tasty with coffee like biscotti but more melt in your mouth not too sweet not too bland just right loved them
positive,30/5/21,i ordered jyoti natural foods looking for something healthy and quick while providing a lot of protein this tastes really good i was shockingly surprised and relieved my money was well spent i ve had indian food at very authentic places have a lot of indian friends and i d say this is very close to going out to eat highly recommend

positive,21/4/21,i just received these as a birthday gift from my sister the strawberries were perfectly fresh juicy and sweet they were dipped perfectly and completely coated in delicious chocolate i was so impressed she ordered them yesterday and i received them today they came nicely wrapped with birthday ribbon and packaged with a freezer or cold pak again i would highly recommend these as a delicious treat they are expensive but well worth the special treat for someone
positive,2/5/21,i find these to be addictively tasty i like the oz tins because if i eat a whole tin it s not really that bad compared to oz
positive,18/12/19,i use this as a treat for training and my dog just begs for more lessons i slice into small bites then add a little warm water and soak for mins easy and my dog won t choke when she inhales the food during lessons
positive,19/1/20,this product is a great organic version of tuna helper my family loves it and it tastes great
positive,19/1/20,i bought my first jar of kraft s vegemite the australian brand and i must say the flavor is strong salty and slightly bitter every morning i have a bit of vegemite on my buttered toast i have quickly become very fond of this new morning ritual it is an excellent source of folic acid and b vitamins i recommend that you experience the flavor sensation for yourself
positive,31/3/20,like all other diet powdered chocolate it doesn t dissolve well even in the hottest water you have to smash some of it against the side of the cup to get it to dissolve i use it in my coffee mmmmmmmmm yum
positive,18/12/19,i absolutely love this drink but everyone else i know cannot understand why i do they all say it taste like medicine but to me its delicious liquid crack i suggest trying one before buying a pk because it is an acquired taste i love it and have been drinking this for years
positive,13/10/19,this tea is very robust and tasty especially after a long tiring day at work i sooths your nerves after a long day and works wonders on a cold winter evening while reading or just chilling
positive,28/9/20,this is the second time i have purchased this item no sugar added taste like regular chocolate not like sugar free which is awful good night time drink before bed
positive,16/11/20,the hot chocolate has a great taste i purchased it because my sister was worried about the kids having too much sugar every night before bed the kids had no idea it was sugar free even the adults we gave it to had no clue like other reviewers said it doesn t mix very well so we actually made it on the stove in a pot so it would have time to mix up if you were looking to make one packet with just some hot water stir it a lot and even then you will have some chocolate not melted on a positive note each packet does make a decent size cup of hot chocolate enjoy
positive,27/2/20,this is probably the best tasting zero calorie flavored water i have ever had becareful though this does have sugar alcohol in it and if you have too much it can because bowel discomfort
positive,26/2/21,if you like strong coffee you this with the medium r small size setting i prefer mine on the maximum water setting and it is quite tasty and very consistant from box to box i have tasted better only in coffee specialty cafe s timothy s world coffee midnight magic extra bold k cups for keurig brewers count boxes pack of
positive,18/12/19,this is about as good a cup of coffee as you can get single serving is great and although it may cost more per pound it saves money in the long run because you don t throw any away always hot and always fresh with scheduled deliveries i never run out i strongly recommend it
positive,19/1/20,this is the best coffee if you like a strong cup a real wake me up
positive,13/9/20,so many flavorings like this sound and look great but taste funky this tastes great i have only tried the black cherry and it does give you a little boost as well not a caffiene heart thumper
positive,10/7/20,it taste good but bags seems too much for me so share with your friends also suggest other flavor of indomie noddles
positive,14/4/21,these taste so much better than the ones i bought at the grocery store which turned out to be plain white sugar sprayed with carmel coloring these are pure demerara sugar with a taste similar to brown sugar
positive,24/4/21,this brand of pasta is easy to cook and taste great my children can t tell the difference between it and wheat pasta
positive,28/4/21,i like this product because it has a lot of protein and whey protein since i am allergic to soy which is in almost everything else it tastes good promises no junk included and seems to work well for me
positive,12/7/21,ordered these after receiving my new k cup machine taste great after finding the correct serving size quick service and good price definitely ordering more

positive,28/4/21,i was introduced to kilambe coffee by a friend and immediately i tasted quality it is now part of my special collection along with my vietnamese coffee used only on weekends special occasions or having guests over if you enjoy a dark bold taste with the slightest scent chocolate and a fruity feel from mother nature at high altitude kilambe is for you
positive,8/8/20,bought this for my wife we d recently bought a celestial seasons variety pack and had been stunned by the over a dollar a cup price tag this was a much better buy and is now my wife s favorite k cup tea regardless of price i just wish amazon would offer it as a subscription so we can shave off that fifteen percent
positive,22/5/21,i am pleased with this salad dressing the olive oil flavor comes through nicely i have used this salad dressing on regular garden type salads and it tastes like home made dressing i have also used in pasta salad and it adds a zesty taste using this olive oil based dressing is a good marinade for meats chicken or even veggies especially if grilling there is a good balance between the herbs and olive oil to make this salad dressing taste good in different types of food if you like vinegrette you will find many uses for this product i highly recommend it
positive,18/12/19,though it made my water taste better it did not make me zippy i did feel as though i was getting nutrients and enjoyed the flavor it did not take much to give it taste either
positive,19/1/20,i add this to my cold brew lipton ice tea that i prepare took a bit of experimenting to get the right amount of juice concentrate but once perfected it s like drinking the perfect blend of sweetened ice tea the taste is great and no calories can t beat that only demerits is that the price is rather high could use a few dollars off on the bulk purchases
positive,3/8/20,this liquid vitamin is pretty tasty i thought it made my water taste like watered down crystal light my kids also liked that it made their water turn pink and gave it a faint sweet taste it s not overwhelming in sweetness or vitamin in taste i could not detect the vitamins at all the only downside is that it requires refrigeration after opening
positive,29/7/21,this drink tastes as good or better than similar drinks that we ve had that are made of powder the directions don t tell you how much to squeeze into your water so i would imagine it depends on how big of a glass or bottle you have and how strong you want it to taste you can always add more the only concern i have about it is there is caffeine in it and i really don t want to have any extra caffeine after my coffee in the morning you might want to beware of that if you are buying this for children
positive,8/7/20,tried the fruit punch in a glass of water a little goes a long way and tastes great turn bottled water or tap water into a great tasting beverage refreshing no cal and healthy
positive,13/4/21,i m always looking for a good energy drink that will give me a boost but not a big let down i like the glaceau energy water this is a good alternative this makes ounce servings at a bottle it s only cents a glass vs or so for the vitamin water by glaceau or others found in the supermarkets and convenience stores the flavor is like a light fruit punch you can control how much you want to add to your water for taste it has a combination of vitamins b and vitamin c zinc magnesium and chromium it has about the same amount of caffeine as a can of soda so not too much no jittery feeling after drinking it it is good to get healthy vitamins while i m drinking water and not just sugar and caffeine from sodas
positive,20/2/21,i do not drink energy drinks on a regular basis but i do enjoy them while outside exercising energy drinks usually have sugars and caffeine in order to claim to be energy drinks and this stuff also has taurine in it one can also taste the sucralose it also contains vitamin c b b b b and electrolytes the taste is a citrusy punch delight and the fact that this comes out of a squeeze bottle that is measured to yield servings means it s easier to allow for more or less liquid according to taste i prefer my drinks on the weak side because i drink more of it and strong red drinks tend to leave a red moustache on my upper lip the red dye in this mixture can stain countertops so be careful when pouring this liquid easily comes out of the bottle and returned to the frig afterwards for the occassional drinker who would need a month to finish off the contents this isn t a bad tasting mixture i haven t felt a zing after drinking this though
positive,9/12/20,this is not nearly as concentrated as the mio water flavors that you also squirt into your glass or bottle of water but you get a lot more of it oz and one fluid oz squirt has daily requirement for vitamin c and no calories the fruit punch tastes good however i like my water to be very weakly flavored so i probably put in about a squirt giving me of my daily requirement for vitamin c it s mainly advertised as being a source of vitamin c but there are more things beside vitamin c in it vitamin c vitamin b vitamin b vitamin b vitamin b zinc chromium the plastic bottle is a good shape for your hand to grab it easily and squeeze this might be a good way to get some needed vitamin c without having to eat a lot of citrus or swallowing vitamin c pills and if you like your water flavored but are particular like me about how much flavor is in it then this is a good way to control it
positive,1/4/21,i love this drink squeeze a bit into water lemonade or club soda this tastes great i found it to have a fruit taste a little sweet and the best part you do not have to use a lot i found it out to be better then the mio fits in my bag no more pricey drinks at stores no more a few drops and i have a refreshing drink everyone in my family really enjoyed it as well
positive,25/2/21,i really love this stuff and i will be buying more for sure one bottle lasts a really long time too it is better than any of the diet fruit punches i have tried so far i really can t recommend this enough stars
positive,18/12/19,having worked in a movie theater in high school and through college popcorn is a very nice treat that was years ago and it is still a very nice treat the seasoning salt makes this treat even more enjoyable by adding the right flavor to the popcorn to bring back memories of going to a movie in a less stressful time
positive,19/1/20,everyone likes this it s very salty so you only need to use a tiny bit i add about half a teaspoon to the popcorn before popping and it s very tasty this carton should last for a long time
positive,14/10/20,my cats love this food and particularly the duck flavor this is a high quality cat food however depending on your cat he she may prefer another brand flavor what can be said is that this is a really healthy food for your cat
positive,10/3/21,i usually use hellmann and bought this and will be purchasing it again my family and i really like it
positive,15/8/21,i really like the taste just a touch of salt but they are more chewy then i would like the gustaf s rounds are a little better
positive,27/4/21,very tasty but as a word of caution do not over eat these bears when the label warns you it may have a laxative affect believe it otherwise enjoy
positive,24/1/21,a good product overall it s just a base so anything you add will step up the flavor tastes good with any meat a little butter and plain yogurt mixed in makes it smooth a creamy the tiger tiger and patak s ready made sauces are good too
positive,14/7/20,biryani when done as per instructed comes out really good and authentic i do not like their other products but highly recommend this for any indian food lover total preparation time is around hour but its really worth it
positive,5/6/21,we tried all different saimins noodles the dashi soup is most delicious didn t know koreans made saimins too they are better then japanese saimins noodles cannot wait till i receive them
positive,9/7/21,i saw these as i was checking out of a beer store honestly and thought i would give them a try they are all organic and taste great they are also all shaped somewhat differently roundish which gives them a unique homemade look the color is a bit off white as well with some dark chunks small but not specks in them which adds to the unique appearance these are not made with artificial sweeteners yet the calorie carb content is very low the mint flavor is interesting because i found it got more intense as kept on sucking not less so as others do great product and much cheaper here than where i bought mine cool
positive,5/6/21,i received this item as part of a gift during the christmas holidays i enjoyed it so much i got on the internet and searched until i found it although it may not be everyone is cup of tea it will become a regular part of the holidays at my house
positive,13/7/21,i enjoy this tea plain with honey or with a splash of milk the ingredients are simple and natural no soy lecithin no so called natural flavorings very difficult to find herbal tea in the market place that doesn t have junk added to cheap it out my children enjoy this tea warm with honey during the winter iced during the summer with a hint of sugar and a wedge of lemon ingredients hibiscus cinnamon ginger peppermint orange peel rose hips rose petals
positive,9/7/21,my two basenjis had a few guests over last week end and came the time to share a few bully sticks the atmosphere was electric everybody was sitting nicely some of them were holding their paw in the air as if to say me first me first the noses were twitching the tongues were meticulously run over them turning every piece of olfactive information into tasty dribble anxious eyes opened socket expanding wide the wait was unbearable after a few seconds of this gleeful spectacle i handed the treats out everybody grabbed theirs there were a few side glances a couple were dropped but immediately retrieved nerves you see and after one or two growls the chewing began it sounded like a mini munching factory the stench was heavenly and when every little fiber had been devoured we all cheered for valuebull tree times
positive,8/7/21,i have to respectfully disagree with some of the other reviewers although i did not find this the best version of earl grey out there it was very tasty and i enjoyed it for a system that can provide me with tea at a moments notice i am quite pleased you can t expect something that provides you convenience like the tassimo to produce the same results as hand brewing from a tea bag or leaves
positive,15/7/21,according to my labs this tastes great it also lasts a long time against two chewers that get through most anything very quickly
positive,6/7/21,i am currently in afghanistan and we received this mix in a care package the smell filled our entire building we almost had to lock our door to keep people out the entire loaf was gone in about minutes absolutely delicious we added the oz of water and then added another ounce because the dough looked a little dry again this was one of the best breads we have made here yet and will be ordering some very soon
positive,13/8/21,they were very tasty bought them for my son he is interested in anything japanese they last a while in your mouth but not too chewy almost like gum you can swallow they have a great flavor not to sweet or tart i highly recommend them the price was good as well for pack i believe
positive,5/6/21,i fell in love with this tasty snack when i grew up in england i guess it is fortunate that when i have opened a bag to indulge these addictive snacks no one wants anything to do with them it truly is an acquired taste but once you have it you can t stop i love them with a cool cocktail in the evenings especially a whiskey sour i buy them now by the case and can t wait to get home tonight to indulge
positive,9/7/21,the fruit cake is very tasty and pricy as all the good ones are glad i found it
positive,17/6/21,this coffee is very strong tasting we cut it in half with regular coffee and it still tastes wonderful it makes the house smell like maple syrup as it is brewing but the taste is not too much love it
positive,31/8/21,took a while to arrive and the box was kind of dingy but it was well worth the wait nice kick for coffee sugar free ice cream and as flavored sweetener
positive,7/8/21,i love this coffee i ve been drinking eight o clock for years until i tried cameron s southern pecan which is much better it has a definite nutty flavor the pecan flavor itself more subtle but definitely detectable a little chocolaty flavor adds to it to make a rich but not bitter taste if brewed right i find that level tablespoons to oz of water is about right but i make mine slightly stronger anything less than tablespoons to oz and it ll taste like average store bought it s just got a wonderful warm flavor i just make enough for cups in the morning grinding enough beans for days so it doesn t lose flavor great stuff
positive,5/6/21,this soda bread mix makes for good food it s very expensive though but for the right occasion or a treat i will buy again
positive,9/7/21,i bought these berries as i needed to add something to my cart for super saver shipping i was planning to get goji berries from whole foods in bulk the cheapest source by me for organic gojis in town they run about a pound there i got them on sale here for i liked the ones from whole foods but these are even better they are fresher probably since they are put reasonably quickly into the bags and sealed the other ones taste like some sort of gummy fruit rolll up type treat good but these actually taste like a fruit you should buy some the only problem is that i eat them too quickly they should be called wolf them down berry
positive,19/6/21,oil is very pleasant to the palate fruity with a distint olive taste which is what i was looking for excellent product far superior to any italian evo i have tried
positive,5/9/21,tastes every bit as delicious as regular heinz ketchup what was disappointing however is that i purchased bottles and the expiration date on each bottle was only months from the date of purchase this was very disappointing as i had expected an expiration date of at least one year or more
positive,10/10/21,chervil the one spice i didn t realize was so darn hard to get after searching up and down this infernal state in hopes of finding it somewhere in person i outstretched my arms to the infamous internet more specifically amazon i typed in the letters and wallah i found items i decided to try this as i have limited experience with chervil i ll admit it and i am happy to report that it was safely in my hands exactly when i wanted it i opened it up to sample the herb and from what i could tell it was also exactly as described i d recommend this herb for at least a taste of something different and considering the speed at which i got the item i am extremely happy so till i experiment again live long and eat well
positive,29/9/21,product was great shipped when it should have price was right i would recomend this product to others we use the raw coconut butter in our oatmeal and toast
positive,11/9/21,quick and easy to prepare this is one of the few whole wheat pastas i ve found that has a great taste i use orzo in place of rice in recipes as well as in soups etc
positive,5/6/21,each of the gummies are in indiviually wrapped bags like one they fit perfectly in my favor bags for my wedding would for sure get these again in the future really adorable
positive,9/7/21,i goit my package a day late which isn t that bad buuuuut eh at least it got here i had a bliss almost immediately after opening the box at first the fizziness and awesome was amazing and the taste was grand but the fizziness left really quickly i did not feel blissfull but instead i fell asleep for about two hours the sonic i just opened and have taken two sips amazing flavour amazing stuff i m already feeling a bit of energy d i lovelovelove that the top slides off and can act as a cup its helping me make sure i drink it slowly and enjoy it as much as possible great product overall the four star is only because of the day late package i m sure its because i ordered on a friday and so there was confusion about weekend timings and such eh
positive,26/8/21,just received my shipment best by date is june of and it s mid march even though it s only me i m pretty sure i ll use most of it by the time june rolls around tasted just like the starbucks pods i ve purchased locally before the stores stopped carrying them definitely no complaints
positive,26/7/21,as far as english tea s go it is at the top of my list very beautiful dark red color and incredibly flavourful i drink about cups of this tea a day though sometimes i will mix the day up with a cup of barry s gold blend also a fantastic tea though i feel yorkshire gold is better by just a hair
positive,11/9/21,it really rastes great no real aftertaste either like some other energy drinks color is fun as well and makes for a great mixer i will order again
positive,11/9/21,the product description is very accurate i received my item in a timely manner and the items were well packaged and still frozen the portions are large and are very easy to prepare in the oven and of course the chicken cordon bleu has a wonderful savory taste that isn t skimpy on either the ham or cheese if i could rate stars i would simply due to price however don t let price stop you from ordering these are delicious
positive,15/9/21,i bought this in an effort to reduce my sodium intake and replace ketchup on everything i eat i ve put in on eggs cauliflower cabbage and some meat dishes tastes great very happy with this and will try some other flavors
positive,5/6/21,this was my first time eating pad thai favored anything these were the very thin noodles if i remember correctly it s a unique taste compared to most ramen i mean fried noodles i have purchased in the last month definitely worth a try if you are planning on tasting some different asian dishes
positive,14/9/21,these granola bars are quite delicious out of the three bars that kashi makes these are my second favorite next to the trail mix ones these make a good snack
positive,29/9/21,nice for break fast no bloated tummy applely flavor enjoyed several breakfastes with the pan cakes good taste and texture yummy for kids too
positive,10/7/21,these are by far and away the best chocolate chip granola bars they re nice and chewy without being too dry or wearing out your jaw like other organic granola bars we are never without these as a special treat for us or our kids however they re way cheaper at walmart around a box and there are generally coupons that can be printed online which brings the price inline with a sale price on quaker bars which don t even come close in taste to the cascadian farms bars not to mention the high frutose corn syrups and hydrogenated oils in quaker bars even with subscribe and save these are a box boo for the price
positive,1/3/20,i do not know if i believe this tea is helpful for losing weight but it tastes great and its a wonderful alternative to soda which is the reason i bought it
positive,28/7/20,i was a bit cautious when i first opened the box i need gluten free and sugar free products with low carbs this candy fit the bill the texture is a bit strange but wow the candy is tasty and lasts a long time i bought the ginger licorice and raspberry flavor

positive,3/8/19,these are delicious it s been hard to find a good stewed tomato the kind my mom used to can this is very close a real fresh tomato taste and seasoned perfectly other brands have a tinny taste to them and usually are too sweet
positive,6/2/21,i can t say enough about this philadelphia suburb local company bala cynwyd i hope one day skinny water will be linked with philly like soft prezels and cheese steaks of course the best cheese steaks are in the suburbs of philly this product got me off soda
positive,13/5/21,i have tried all the commercial brands of hemp milk the second best to tempt is hemp bliss by manitoba harvest which is more green tasting tempt unsweetened original is delicious enough to drink straight with no grassy notes after a few mornings of breakfast with tempt i feel like i am almost eating cereal with milk by itself it is refreshing what s greatest of all is that there are no pesticides or herbicides and no gmos and hemp is grown on sustainable farms the ingredients are free of gums preservatives chemicals and flavor enhancers and this one has no sweeteners the only real downside is like almost every commercial producer they insist on adding traces of cheap vitamins to produce an unbleak nutritional analysis i take exception to the addition of vitamin a palmitate in particular as having no health benefits whatsoever
positive,1/3/20,beats other brands by a mile love the taste kind of earthy milky smooth has a straw like aftertaste that does not linger high in omega too but wonder why amazon dealers sell over retail is mind blowing especially on a case you d expect a big discount my local health food store has it for two eighty two a box
positive,28/7/20,very tasty item although i enjoy it more with some veggies but overall great sauce and quality product
positive,13/5/20,i m not a tea snob and this tea taste great came fresh and packaged well and at a much better price then the local tea shop and health food stores
positive,26/3/21,if you re a fan of sweet or honey mustard try this out french s has a good line of various mustard flavors and this doesn t disappoint you get the tangy spiciness of mustard with an edge of honey so for those of you who like a touch of sweetness in your condiments this shouldn t disappoint you
positive,29/8/19,five pounds of beans is a lot of coffee the dark brazilian beans seem to sit somewhere between a columbian and french roast the flavor is very nice and makes a nice cup of dark brew
positive,7/2/21,i ve been drinking this coffee every morning for about a year now and really like it the pound bag lasts a while so it s an excellent value it smells wonderful when you first open it i m so glad to not be spending a fortune on grocery store coffees anymore

positive,14/9/21,if you like rice cereal and need gluten free all the erewhon brown rice cereals are really tasty
positive,17/12/20,i like good coffee and have tried quite a few different coffee beans i have been very satisfied with the flavor of cameron s organic french roast whole bean coffee plus it is organic which is just a wonderful extra i certainly intend to keep buying this coffee if the flavor continues to be so good
positive,2/5/20,we have tried many different whole bean french roast coffees this is one of the better we have tasted the fact that it is fair trade organic and shade grown is a bonus
positive,14/7/21,this was quite yummy i tried it and also is nice and thick to help older babies learn to eat food with more texture my son preferred this to apple sauce which is about half as thick as this
positive,18/7/19,peanuts were shipped very quickly and i received them days after placing the order they taste great and are exactly as described
positive,1/3/20,i put these in one of those antique looking gum ball machines you can buy for your home the yummy hot cinnamon flavor has the perfect amount of heat and sweet

positive,10/3/20,i forgot all about these fine treats i think i will add them to my order there are so many sugar free treats that do not seem sugar free and this is one of them shaka sez check them out
positive,9/5/20,this is the best tasting soup i recommend this soup to anyone who has a head cold after eating a bowl of this soup with mixed vegetables cut cooked chicken breast my head cold was gone the next day
positive,14/5/19,i cannot have chocolate but can consume white chocolate i was looking for something to add to my milk so i could have a change once in awhile this product is very good tasting but doesn t mix to well in cold milk i still use it though and enjoy the flavor
positive,19/10/20,these things are great they never freeze solid they re always slushly and each one is only calories
positive,1/3/20,gopicnic is a wonderful option for my college aged daughter she never really stops to eat and when she does finally give into hunger it s usually not good food she loves the convenience of the packaging and the freshness of gopicnic i appreciate the nutrition in each package the new salmon and crackers is one of her favorites

positive,4/8/20,i had tasty bite punjab eggplant that i picked up from target under bucks inexpensive and yummy very similar to kashk bademjan i had at a local restaurant great with some pita bread chips or raw carrots etc
positive,26/12/19,i keep a few of these in my desk at work for days when i don t feel like going out to lunch they are super convenient because you can microwave them as is just tear open slightly to vent and put in the microwave no bowl required just a spoon or in a pinch tilt your head back and slurp it the taste is great i love indian food and i love vegetables so this is perfect for me the only thing to mention is that one of my co workers complained about the smell but he s that sorta complainy person who doesn t eat indian food and prefers burger king it tastes great smells great and is super convenient
positive,28/3/21,i tried this today and it was delicious it s not the texture you at first expect from eggplant the flavors bridge that and are really great next time i will put this over rice
positive,6/2/20,i don t like plain coffee but even more i don t need or like all the calories and fat that come with using flavored coffee creamers even the sugar free creamers have a ton of fat part of which is hydrogenated partially hydrogenated flavor blends for coffee are a wonderful alternative to fatty creamers easy to use and they come in portable small packages you can take with you anywhere this is not a creamer but more a flavored sugar one packet gives a yummy subtle hazelnut flavor but without being too sweet the way some things with splenda are
positive,25/4/21,with no extra salt it tastes a lot like fresh corn you can add the salt after if that is to your taste everybody s will be different

positive,27/2/18,i love oatmeal cookies and have made them at least hundred times i love my cookies but these come in a very close second to my under baked soft homemade vanishing oatmeal cookies there s some ingredients in these cookies that i don t find in my kitchen cabinet but if you re not against prepackaged food it shouldn t bother you i loved the allspice taste but my guy friend didn t that much i think he s just partial to my cookies the individual serving size is nice i m more apt to just have one cookie this way rather than opening a whole box and having to eat them before they get stale i could say that individually wrapping the cookie saves me from just having one more and one more and they are delicious and make me feel like i m eating something that is somewhat healthy for me after all there is oatmeal in the cookie
positive,20/2/18,love these cookies my son asks me to heat one for him in the microwave for about sec its soooo good that way gives it the freshly baked feel i always make sure to keep in stock in my home they are also individually packed do makes it easy to carry along in my bag
positive,22/3/18,when i opened the packaging i was surprise to find one of the best tasting cookie i have had in a while not only did it taste great the texture was perfect and it was fresh
positive,12/3/18,received these in my influenster box for summer taste great and very soft seemed to be a healthy alternative to regular cookies just concerned as to how much they will cost
positive,9/2/18,these cookies are very tasty and soft i received a complementary cookie in my mom vox box and will definitely be buying more
positive,7/12/17,i got this cookie as a part of my mom box from voxbox i m not too keen on oatmeal cookies but this one was surprisingly good i guess i m more used to them being hard so i really liked the soft chewiness of my cookie now a chocolate chip one would be fab
positive,24/5/19,these cookies are quaker baked mom and kid approved they are soft chewy and most of all delicious the texture and taste makes them seem homemade without the hassle of baking
positive,9/3/18,these cookies taste fantastic even my picky children love them and ask for them every time we go to the grocery store
positive,18/5/18,these are some of the best oatmeal raisin cookies ever i usually bake my own cookies but to be honest i m not sure i can do better than these they are soft melt in your mouth and bursting with flavor
positive,23/3/18,these were really good i got them free to try and loved them very filling and tasty me and my husband shared it and we couldn t wait to buy more
positive,8/9/20,these are very good nice and soft would for sure get again since they are packaged individually its nice for travel a great snack
positive,23/2/18,the soft baked oatmeal cookies may be the best oatmeal cookies you can eat that are not homemade they are well baked to the point had they spent another minute or two in the oven they may be burnt which is exactly how i like my cookies and even though they are soft they are firm enough they do not crumble in your hand and there is enough raisins you will have at least one or more in every bite on the flip side the ingredient list is a bit lengthy with a few ingredients that i cannot pronounce is a red flag for me
positive,18/7/20,these quaker cookies are so great they are easy to carry around and they make a great snack when you are on the run
positive,14/6/18,loved my quaker cookie it taste really good and is very soft unlike them other hard cookies i could eat a whole box of these yes they taste that good
positive,2/11/18,these cookies are soft and delicious possibly because they rely more on oat flour than just rolled oats they lack the chewy texture of a traditional oatmeal cookie instead they are almost melt in your mouth with nicely soft raisins as well perhaps the only truly detrimental characteristic is that they taste more like a raisin and spice cookie than an oatmeal cookie i enjoy the taste of oatmeal and wouldn t mind if it was brought more to the forefront i don t usually buy individually wrapped food so i don t think i d buy this product again but i would certainly recommend it to others
positive,14/10/18,the first were great the second was spoiled but amazon contacted the supplier and shipped another batch so far they are ok
positive,6/4/20,jelly belly s have always been my secret vice now that i live out of the country i got this mammoth jar and it will last me more than a year it came fresh and well sealed and right on time love the variety of flavors yum
positive,9/3/18,these were really tasty some might even say habit forming the only thing is that they are a little expensive my family loved them so i ll likely purchase them again
positive,7/3/18,this was a gift for my mom for mother s day she seemed to like it a lot of them all seemed to taste the same
positive,24/1/19,my wife found this coffee in a local grocery store and it is great tasting coffee however the local grocery quit carrying it and we were able to find it at amazon we started ordering and it has so far been a good experience
positive,27/2/19,the popcorn salt was an added tasty treat to homemade popcorn thanks for the prompt shipment
positive,19/4/20,i really like lentils so i gave this a go good balance of veggies and lentils a bit too salty though overall a great product i would definitely buy again
positive,17/4/20,i eat this cereal almost every morning it has a great taste and texture i have been gluten free for months now and this is my favorite cereal i know that this is marketed for kids but as i am yrs old i can truly say that adults live this cereal too
positive,3/4/20,once we tried this fabulous spice mix for beef fajitas we were hooked we use this spice mix everytime we prepare fajitas on both chicken and beef it is not too spicy so if you like real heat you might want to add some cayenne pepper it is just right for us and allows the beefy flavor of the skirt steak to come through it also does chicken proud we serve them on fresh flour tortillas
positive,7/8/19,i like the fact that this capuccino is not that sweet the taste is really good i give it four stars because i like the amaretto one even more
positive,9/3/18,great taste and goes with all types of mexican food have used for years and all of a sudden this product extremely hard to find at grocery stores and walmart so was pleased i could order and shipment was here quickly
positive,18/5/18,this steak rub is awesome we have tried many different ones and came across this one in a grocery store it quickly became our favorite after that we couldn t find it in any local stores so having the pack is great
positive,27/1/19,these are excellent i was worried they would taste too natural and not really like a cookie kind of like the difference between kashi cereal and normal cereal but they taste like any high quality choc chip cookie and have the added benifit of being a little bit more healthy easier to justify than a pack of oreo s all in all a excellent product that arrived in perfect condition and i have a active once a month subscription for them for the last months
positive,10/11/19,this is the only store bought cookie i will eat when it s kashi i know its healthy love the wholesome goodness of oats with the chocolate chips this is a staple in my house treat yourself
positive,8/11/19,i had heard that champagne vinegar was good from tv chefs and cooking magazines i realize now just what i was missing i highly recommend it you won t be disappointed a little goes a long way
positive,25/10/21,to be fair i have not tried this in my drip coffee maker only the bialetti moka express cup stovetop percolator the flavor is strong but smooth it s not as bitter acidic as starbucks and i like starbucks alot definitely recommend for the bialetti p s the tins are nice too great for re use around the house
positive,8/5/20,nothing and i mean absolutely nothing compares to these semi hard chocolate she will outside and incredibly smooth chocolate inside it s heaven in a box godiva doesn t even compare the absolute best chocolate ever
positive,28/9/18,cheese is great just what we were looking for considering it is hard to find this product
positive,29/7/19,my boys have severe allergies this is something that they enjoy and are able to eat i love these because they are easy to pack on the go
positive,9/3/18,this honey tastes great plus the fact that it is raw and research indicates it may be useful in the healing of stomach ulcers is a bonus
positive,18/5/18,if you are looking for a tasty snack look no further these caramel fiber one bars taste like a cross between a candy bar and a granola bar the consistency is chewy but not so chewy that it gets stuck in your teeth since each bar provides of daily recommended fiber it s relatively healthy as well for those individuals that are on weight watchers these bars are points each and well worth it i highly recommend this snack i also recommend the peanut butter fiber one bars although they are not quite as tasty in my opinion fiber one bars oats and peanut butter count boxes pack of
positive,17/5/20,this apple butter has a great taste but the price is so i would not purchase again i know it can not cost this much to produce such a small jar
positive,26/3/20,these are very pricey so i only enjoy them now and then as a treat but the flavor is wonderfull and the packaging is very nice would make a wonderfull gift to send to someone who likes such dainties i will order again when i run out truly a nice treat
positive,24/2/20,i have bought several of the vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality the product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better my labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than most
positive,27/3/20,the recommendation when we bought our puppies lhasa bichon mix and lhasa poodle mix was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned this is a somewhat expensive food so i can t say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home let me just say this i have had small dogs before never have i seen such gas issues both of them consistently had foul gas consistently usually when they re sitting on our laps but you know they re dogs when we got through the first bag of this stuff we purchased more on amazon it was a great price for it since we got a lb bag for the price of i think a lb bag at petco but they continued to have gas i mean they loved the food don t get me wrong and they loved it more when we d mix in some water and it would be like soft food somehow that made their gas worse but i think i ll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down can t blame the food itself for gluttony eventually we switched their food no more farting i think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies they just need that in their diet i think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful they said up until year yeah right you try dealing with gas for that long around mos of age we switched to puppychow much better granted they don t like it as much but we humans like it a whole lot better
positive,31/12/20,although there were several shriveled ones they taste just fine i mostly use them to make vegan sauces and other recipes that call for running them through a food processor so they don t have to look perfect anyways for the price they are a great deal about half of what i find them for in the store
positive,13/1/20,just got this order and it is ok a bit light on the cheddar flavoring and herb taste eludes me if it is there
positive,21/9/20,better than organic oats advertised elsewhere takes lots of water these are not minute oats so my oatmeal cookies come out right not all crumbly and soggy instant oats have their place but not in cookies
positive,2/12/20,i ve used maybe half a dozen bags of this tea in the last year and it is a delicious consistently good quality black tea mainly i use it and several other numi teas in my tea blends for making kombucha
positive,20/11/19,the product is of high quality and has a rich full flavor delivery was unexpectedly fast the only negative i would like to see addressed is that the product is packed in a heavy paper sack while this may be commonplace a significant improvement would be to have an inner liner of a heavy weight food grade plastic bag that can be sealed after each time you open the bag could be either a zip lock bag or a twist tie closure doesn t make any difference just need a practical way to preserve the freshness of the product and keep the bugs out of it this is a health and spoilage issue s of oatmeal is a lot of product and needs to either be repackaged by the consumer in small food grade bags or containers very expensive and hard to find i am a single senior who likes to buy staple goods in bulk to save money and provide food security long term storage is a big issue with people like me thom missouri
positive,11/12/19,i previously tried other matcha products and was generally satisfied with the quality but not the price i decided to give pure matcha green and rooibos a try because the price seemed to be very competitive the quality of pure matcha s products surpasses that of all others i have tried stays fresh has a consistent texture and tastes great both the quality and price are better than others that i have purchased for the same quantity i highly recommend pure matcha and will continue to purchase
positive,28/6/20,all of the roland products are top quality roland s caviar is the real deal unlike some other brands that are really made from seaweed
positive,8/8/20,my doggie really likes newman s organic better than some other dog foods pet and big box stores sell my budget doesn t like newman s organic as much as harmony farms it s the compromise that keeps the doggie and my budget happy because he eats it heartily i don t worry that he s getting enough high quality food otherwise he won t eat his food and he ll graze in the trash seeking egg shells and bones to fill the void there s no barfing digestion problems or accidents high quality food means good digestion a shiny coat high energy bright eyes and a good attitude without tons of additional elixers treats or vet bills a definite cost effective win win for doggie and me i ve had great results with newman s dog food that i orderd through amazon but there s pounds less for about the same price psst i m not an organic fanatic it s the nutritional value that counts for my fur baby and human kids update noticed this has jumped to almost thirty bucks will opt for newman s organic when the costs per pound are the same my dog likes both harmony and newman my budget likes the one most cost effective at the time of purchase update last batch of harmony farms i ordered had a rancid oil smell when i opened the bag and the pooch wouldn t eat it as readily as he has in the past he wouldn t eat for a day and started checking out the trash i subsequently purchased some canned and pouch foods cooked brown rice etc as mix ins to encourage him to make it through this pricey bag not sure how this is stored before it arrives to my home but the texas heat can make anything stale rancid yucky quickly i probably should have called customer service but felt the replacement would have the same issue due to the hot weather here definitely exploring hot weather alternatives
positive,14/7/21,no more heavy grocery bags for me i ve just ordered my first bag of harmony farms dog food and it was delivered to my door by ups the food is excellent quality i bought this product based on its healthy ingredients the dogs love it and i love amazon for making it so easy to buy july one of my dogs has had bouts of inflammatory bowel disease previously she had to have special food from my vet royal canaan duck potato for the past years she has tolerated even thrived on the harmony farms food w o any problems each bag of harmony farms is about cheaper than the royal canaan hard to fight i am a believer the canned food is great too september my dog who has had inflammatory bowel disease in the past verified by surgery has never felt better she is a wire and has the energy of a yr old dog she is she is not on any daily medication this healthy weight formula has helped her to thrive enough protein not too much fat seem to do the trick i highly recommend it
positive,2/12/20,i love this tea it has a very smooth taste and not bitter like other kind of tea i do agree that the string seems to come apart easily but i can live with that no big deal the quality of tea makes up for that
positive,20/11/19,i got two bags from my friend who got it from his friend who said it was primo so i chucked them in a zip lock when i got home mos later i opened it and had some today i am online trying to find more
positive,1/3/21,had this sent to me in afghanistan the flavor was enjoyable but not to spicy it is made with quailty ingridents i would surely say this is one of the best salsa s i ve ever had
positive,5/5/21,these are excellent quality flaxseeds i just toasted them a little on a pan and even that made a great snack i also powdered them in a coffee grinder after toasting them a little and the powder is delicious too delicious nutritious awesome planning to have it in my cereal tomorrow and maybe sprinkle some on my veggies i think i will also try out bob s quinoa and museli
positive,2/12/20,lots of uses for this green tea i generally like most tea though not the over ally flowery blends being on more of a health kick in recent years i have added a lot more green tea to my diet in one form or another from straight brewed tea lt hot or iced to adding the powder to things like salad dressings smoothies baked goods etc i am not new to green tea as i first started drinking it when living in japan some years ago in the ground form known as matcha a quality product dissolves well i like both the unsweetened and the lightly sweetened
positive,20/11/19,i like to put wild rice in many dishes this is a good buy and easy to drop into other rice dishes or soups
positive,9/10/21,my month old daughter has loved these ever since she started chewing her food they are tasty healthy and have zero additives on the downside every few handfuls there is a pea that is as hard as a freaking rock i can barely crunch into it with my adult teeth so i worry about what would happen if she really bites down on them with her baby teeth that being said it s been months and nothing bad has happened and it hasn t worried me enough to stop feeding her the peas it s just something that i feel should be noted to those considering purchasing this otherwise excellent product
positive,6/3/21,i thot i was satisfied with the spring water i have bought elsewhere until i bought this brand best i have ever tasted no chemical aftertaste i have cases a month delivered since i also use it for all cooking needs and ice cubes too it is soooooo delicious when making a glass of lemonade from fresh lemons with the aforementioned cubes with agave sweetener mercy as others have stated the ups man does all the hard work and i don t have to worry about running out of the most important staple in my household
positive,2/12/20,i don t understand why this dog food is not full of reviews checkout they give this dog food out of stars which beats science diet and purina one which i use to use and diamond natural is less expensive
positive,20/11/19,i don t review much but i have been buying this brand for my irish wolfhound for over years now he still loves it and it s good for him if you have a large breed dog this dog food will be a good choice for healthy food
positive,25/6/21,this food gets an a rating compared to failing scores for many others in the price range however it s about more here on amazon than at the local pet store after a sales tax
positive,21/7/20,melitta s rich flavourful product is a delicious treat comparable to coffees with a much higher price tag it is a plus that the decaffeinated version does not sacrifice flavour highly recommended
positive,22/2/21,i m a big coffee drinker much against my better judgement but due to a stomach condition i ve been forced to drink mostly decaf for the last few years i usually just get the cheapest coffee i can find near my office after all i don t make a lot of money and every penny counts so it was nice to get this melitta cafe ground coffee to sample when i made my first cup i was immediately attacted by the pleasant aroma i put in a little cream and splendas as i usually do and found the taste a little on the light side yet quite bitter maybe it s because this is decaf but what i did like was its pureness something cent coffees usually lack i have made two cups a day since my first taste and over the last couple of days i ve grown to like this coffee granted to me coffee is pretty much like wine in that all the different varieties taste more or less the same except for the level of bitterness but even i can tell this is gourmet coffee much better than the ones i get at my local coffee stands or even at mcdonald s when they give out free cups for a pack of the price seems decent if you drink decaf i think this is quite worth a try
positive,8/6/21,i love this tea both the green and white varieties are quite consistently fresh i have ordered this at least ten times from various internet sites i didn t realize how old and stale tea from the grocery store was until i had this brand for organic tea it is quite reasonably priced they recommend using two tsp of loose tea per cup i use half that and it tastes great never ever bitter very smooth tasting i highly recommend
positive,2/12/20,i feel good about the quality and mix it with canned pn food she doesn t care for it by itself but then she doesn t like any dry dogfood
positive,25/1/21,dogs love the taste and i love the company especially convenient to have it delivered rather than me lugging it home
positive,1/7/21,we were looking for an organic food after the melamine poisoning of pet food debacle newman s own dry foods for cats and dogs are manufactured in the us per their corporate veterinarian newman s own is up front about their ingredients for an organic food it is affordable also it has been great at keeping skin issues under control lastly newman s own is listed as a more responsible pet food company on several websites
positive,15/3/20,these are beautiful smooth spring roll wrappers and on the package label there is a sticker on each one that reads new technology so i m figuring by the bad reviews that this company changed the way they manufacture their spring roll wrappers and have probably upped their quality control as well i was nervous about ordering these by the bad reviews but i m glad i took a chance because these are a bargain compared to some of the other brands will definitely order these again
positive,6/7/21,i use a lot of various spices in my cooking and wanted to find a source with a quality product at a reasonable price frontier met that discription
positive,29/6/21,i ve been feeding wellness grain free for a couple years now with great results for my cats i believe the cost of a top quality food is well worth it in healthy happy cats and reduced vet bills but still the cost of wellness has been prohibitive i was excited to see felidae had a grain free formula in the larger sized cans and for a much lower price so i am trying it just switched them over this week so far so good the bowls have been licked clean and while i questioned the whole peas when i saw them they weren t left in the bowl the ingredients and quality of the felidae seems comparable to the wellness so unless i find information indicating otherwise and i ve been looking i think we ll stick with felidae
positive,29/6/21,happy with this purchase it s a good deal it s the most fragrant coriander ever coriander is a super spice tri dosha and a health supplement as well research it it s a ground cilantro seed we use it in lots of dishes thank you
positive,26/7/21,i ve tried a number of high quality canned cat foods to supplement the dry food my cats always have available to them and these appear to be the best as judged by me and the cats for one thing these actually look like fish you open the can and there are large pieces of actual fish in the can instead of the weird mystery paste it pretty much smells like you ve opened a can of real fish too not in a bad way though i don t share my cats love of sardines one of my two cats is a picky eater when it comes to canned food i picked up a can of each of the varieties from the local pet store when i wanted to try switching to tiki cat and learned that the picky one will only eat the varieties that include sardines there are a few different sardine varieties so at least it forces her to have some variety in her diet in case they stop producing one of them the picky one has always been very excited about getting her daily quota of canned food but the other cat seems way more excited about dinner time since we switched to tiki cat so i take that as her endorsement of this positive review
positive,21/10/21,i wanted to give homemade vanilla extract as gifts and was extremely satisfied with these beans they made very high quality extract and were much cheaper than at local grocery or organic food stores i was mildly concerned by the size i only needed beans and ended up with closer to however my brother has used the remainder to make delicious vanilla ice cream creme brulee tiramisu custard vanilla sugar french toast etc i have recommended them to friends and family
positive,25/10/21,we ve been using walnut oil for many years we brush it on toast to take the place of butter eliminating much of the saturated fat from our diets it s also wonderful in salads try it tossed into greens with a few nuts and chopped stone fruit or grapes and a fruity vinegar this product is of excellent quality and amazon has a great price for it
positive,29/6/21,it is hard to tell most of the time if supplements work but i just have a greater sense of well being when i take this product it really is a good source for essential fatty acids i expect to keep taking it
positive,5/7/21,i purchased this product for my goats initially i like to give a warm drink of molasses water to my does after they kid and i also give a tablespoon full to any goat that seems to be feeling poorly it seems to give them a good boost when they most need it i bought an extra bottle for the house because i have always loved a bit of molasses on my biscuits much of the molasses even that labeled blackstrap that i have been finding in recent years is bland and seems to lack flavor this molasses is quite delicious if you like molasses and is rich and flavorful it also has high iron content higher than i was finding in other brands
positive,17/9/21,flour type is better than regular flour whether frying it or baking it dough maintains softness and pliability i like it a lot
positive,18/8/21,taste amazing the honey flavor goes well with the smoked barbeque taste it s soft but not too soft it also has a nice tang and spice to it but nothing too extreme smell as soon as i opened it everyone in my section ran up to see what the smell was i d describe it as alluring and inviting not overpowering or off putting price for a pound of this quality of jerky i d expect it would cost more needless to say you get more bang for your buck in short if you want a good jerky to snack on you can t go wrong with this selection do your tastebuds a favor and get this jerky
positive,31/7/21,we are white popcorn enthusiasts and were very pleased with this product large tender kernels of poped corn used an electric self stirring poper worth the cost
positive,18/10/21,nuttzo makes great nut butters their chocolate version is like nutella should be less sugar and other crap delicious and super nutritious
positive,29/6/21,our family really enjoys this shells and cheese i love the convenience of mac and cheese but usually the flavor is horrible annie s tastes great and is better for you can t beat that
positive,16/9/21,my son asked for this plant for his birthday and he is very happy with it it seems to be doing well thus far hopefully it will continue to thrive it was packed well in the box and incurred no damage during shipping
positive,24/8/21,a brother in a sicilian family who owns an italian food market deli here in san diego tipped me off to this product over a year ago the difference it made in salads and vegetables sauces and meats was unbelievable there is a pleasingly clean peppery bite that makes it distinctive adding a bold delicious flavor to fresh salads cooked vegetables and roasted chicken and meats i ve tried many other brands of extra virgin pure select or other types of olive oils growing up in an italian household and in my years none of them stimulated the taste buds with the savory satisfaction delivered by academia barilla extra virgin olive oil the product is not widely known but the laboratories at academia barilla in italy have developed as good a commercial product as is currently on the market and in my opinion it is the very best the cost is high but consistent with the higher end oils but if you enjoy fine foods and preparing aromatic dishes simply put this oil turns them into a gift use it and enjoy the satisfying reaction and comments of dinner guests as they realize they are being treated to a very special dinning experience quality makes a difference
positive,24/6/21,i especially like like this on lydia s organics kale krunchies mega green oz g i empty the kale into a container sprinkle on habanero powder put a lid on it and then turn it over and over to mix the two wow i ve heard it s great with popcorn too whatever you do just be careful how much powder you use i ve been in a world of spicey hurt more than once
positive,29/6/21,my cats love the food and it s on the happy list of companies that don t test on animals linked through the peta site peta org that is very reassuring
positive,5/8/21,i feed prowl because it is a high quality healthy food that does not break my budget it is much cheaper than other premium wet foods wellness weruva etc and my cat seems to like it the only downside to prowl is that since it is dehydrated you must mix it with water and wait minutes before serving my kitten meows at me the entire time i started my cat on prowl because my vet offered a free sample she ate it right away with no problems however she d only ever had healthy food so i was not transitioning from an unhealthy grain filled but addictively tasty food it is very easy to digest and may be a solution for cats with digestion problems i recommend like another reviewer that you order a free sample and give it a try
positive,29/6/21,nice alternative if you can t find them locally great gift for the avid cook
positive,31/7/21,chia seeds are a great healthy food to add to your diet i make chia gel by mixing them with water c per tablespoon of seeds then stir the gel into yogurt oatmeal smoothies it s flavorless and the seeds have a pleasant crunch this brand is high quality and i wouldn t hesitate to recommend it
positive,12/8/21,this is a good product and very high quality the majority of people who post on amazon and the internet are not medical providers and are not the least bit inclined in the area of sciences or infant nutrition there s a large amount of misinformation out there and the misinformation is evident and propagated throughout the reviews for this formula as for this product specifically similac organic it is the top echelon of quality with regard to consistency and nutritional value we ve had great success with this product and are very pleased overall as an adjunct to breastmilk abbott labs product maker is a very large research reagent laboratory for the medical sciences and they have very rigorous quality controls in place published research and they also provide reagents to the scientific research community exacting standards that said i would be less inclined to trust some of the other small makers of formula ie other organic products suggested as better in these reviews especially the referenced small name organic powders all said and done the components in all of the similac products are the highest quality and monitored with advanced scientific protocols and are well researched in published studies i d trust this brand similac over the smaller no names plain and simple keep in mind it s what best suits your baby and with nascent developing gi tracts all babies will experience some degree of gas and discomfort regardless of the formula or nutritional source even breastmilk it s sad to see people in these reviews propagating misinformation as they are neither pediatricians physicians do your own research and best to avoid those with ulterior motives as well as the misinformative reviews and internet blogs that are overly slanted or biased
positive,31/7/20,thought i d take a chance on this as my grocery store does not know about maple syrup grades light amber is best price is beautiful grocery store charged as much for two ounce bottles as this whole quart shipping time was amazing super saver in days and yum reminded me that it s been years since i bought a pound box of maple sugar candy time to search again lt grin forgor to mention definitely grade a fancy not grade b the cooking grade hidden springs maple vermont maple syrup quart fancy grade light amber
positive,13/6/20,my wife became spoiled when we were on a fall trip with the taste of light maple syrup it is not available in the south so she was very happy to find it from amazon com hidden springs is very high quality and have fast shipping thank you
positive,31/7/20,i eat a mix of this along with the asin b e alf nature s path organic heritage flakes cereal ounce bags nearly every morning this is good healthy food unlike the popular sugary cereals most americans eat i enjoy the taste and it doesn t leave me starving by mid morning the price is also more reasonable when i buy it by the case
positive,13/6/20,these beans are a good find as none of our local stores carry any dried pink beans

positive,14/12/20,my family makes a lot of ice tea during the summer we are not able to find affordable quality loose tea in our community lipton s loose tea is the best
positive,9/12/20,i need to watch my sodium but i m not really a fan of salty foods in the first place these almonds are perfect at half the salt i would prefer them over the regular salted almonds any day i have no idea why anyone would want to put more salt on these delicious nuts the three count ounce bags with prime shipping pop on and off of amazon buy them when they are available otherwise you must buy the six pack of small cans at a higher price per ounce
positive,4/8/20,the steaks came well sealed and packaged and were delicious the price was right too for the size and quality of steaks that came i would recommend getting this product for the gourmet food lover in your life
positive,31/7/20,i am happy with my purchase the mushrooms are mostly whole and have a quality shroomy smell to them not old and dusty in other words

positive,21/11/20,so much better than other protein products in drugstores or even gnc taste great and doesn t fill up like other shakes do so you can work out after quickly relatively cheap for all the good things you get with it
positive,25/5/21,i live overseas and bought this for a friend living in the usa who just had a baby recently i wanted to make an impression by sending her and her husband a nice present but not the usual clothing toys etc i decided to go with flowers but wanted to make sure they were the very best i reviewed other roses suppliers and found out that spring in the air actually cuts the roses directly from the farm in colombia and ships them right away via fedex while others are just waiting for orders to come in and their inventory is sitting in a warehouse somewhere in the usa with that said i was sure that my roses were going to live even longer probably a week or two more compared to other roses bought at amazon in addition for the price my bet was that they were going to be top quality so i gave them a try the results they exceeded my expectations and raised the bar firstly their communication goes far beyond usual amazon sellers they keep you posted on how your order is doing received being processed and sent plus they give you instructions in order to guarantee long life of the flowers nice and also advise on how to proceed if nobody is available to receive the roses when fedex first attempts to do so i wrote to the seller to see if i could have a change in the from to card i initially sent in my order and they answered promptly and nicely upon my request even on a weekend roses arrived when promised and an hour later i was receiving a phone call from my friend and her entire family saying how beautiful there roses were how fresh they look and that they had never seen roses with that outstanding quality i was relieved the plan worked perfectly thank you spring in the air i will surely buy from you again please keep up the good job great service and outstanding roses you have
positive,25/5/21,ghee is more than an indulgence ghee can be viewed as an essential vitamin supplement albeit one that tastes really good ghee is especially necessary in a vegetarian diet in my opinion but it can be a healthy addition to any diet some research shows that ghee can even lower cholesterol i performed an extensive survey of the top ghee products available i compared quality and value ghee is so important as an addition to the diet that quality should not be sacrificed especially because only a very small amount of ghee needs to be used the ghee comparison table can be found at this blog see link in comment when i started this ghee comparison i was primarily interested in finding the best value in organic ghee products however i learned that several of the products go well beyond just organic standards it was a very pleasant surprise to find out that such high quality ghee products are available it is also great to see that my two top picks are both available on amazon com grass fed organic ghee is one of those top picks because such high quality ghees are available i focused on understanding which product is the most authentic some of the ghees are much more authentic than others the information in the table link above reflects that fact the focus of my evaluation was not gourmet cooking it was optimum health therefore i was concerned first with which ghee product is the healthiest i rank grass fed organic ghee as one of the very best products grass fed organic ghee is made in accord with the ancient traditions such as phase of the moon chanting etc it is a great quality great tasting product and the good price makes it a great value i highly recommend this ghee
positive,20/1/21,this is a high quality ghee superior tasting and above all made from grass fed cows milk and certified organic by the usda we use it over lentils eggs sauteed veggies quinoa rice you name it and we use it tried it on whole grain toast too yummy being from grass fed cows milk it is rich in clas and boosts immunity and energy and is known to fight and obesity especially trimming the waistline this is my second time buying this and i am a consumer for life i also introduced it to my friends and they are digging the taste i really hope amazon continues to sell this product prime delivery really makes it all the more special please try it for getting healthier and also the incredible taste highly recommended
positive,15/1/21,length mins additionally doesn t state grass fed but i m not so sure such a products exists this product is certainly the best alternative
positive,8/2/21,i can t find dragees cheaper anywhere else these are the exactly the same you would buy at a craft store for allot more

positive,5/12/20,i think these taste pretty good there are lots of nuts and a few raisins in these slightly bigger than bite sized cookies you get cookies for the price so it is sort of pricey but they use quality ingredients so it is probably worth it
positive,1/11/20,i asked my brother who is a chef how he felt about the quality of the product he received and if he could recommend it to anyone his comments were that quality was excellent and he would enjoy having it again in the future as a gift he looked at the idea of buying something similar from hickory farm in the mall where he lives since mother s day caught him and me by surprise since it arrived a week early this year and he came to the conclusion that this product was far better product than anything he could find in the mall i had thought hickory farm would work since he would have physical access to viewing any items from them and his comment was that wisconsinmade this company whose product i am reviewing did a far better job in quality and produce i think that says it for those who see only volume and not quality stay with the grocery store it will give you lots of volume if that is your criteria i will note that i bought a couple of these products from this company and i have copied the same review to each so that people will know that this company has excellent quality quality cheese and quality sausage is expensive and this company makes it well
positive,14/1/21,we feed solid gold food to our dog on a rotating basis for some dumb reason our local pet store doesn t carry the sun dancer so we were glad to find it on amazon we think the solid gold company makes one of the best dog foods on the market today oh yes dog loves it too

positive,5/1/21,this is at a can the most expensive cat food that i ve purchased it seemed overly expensive to me at first the cans are pretty and are only three ounces at first again that didn t seem like much to me but my preconceived notions went out the window when i saw how my cats loved it the pair of kittens kindly took turns eating from one can but they scarfed it down and came and begged for more the adult cats each have been given one can a day these cats never growl at one another but when they re eating petite cuisine they growl when another approaches they finish each serving inhaling it like the nectar of the gods i m ashamed that i d never given this to them before and despite the somewhat pricey bottom line and small cans i think that this is one of the most phenomenal gifts that my cats have ever been given
positive,23/1/21,these peppercorns were visibly of much better quality than we d gotten other places before and the aroma was tantalizing before we even opened the package they arrived fresher than i ve ever tasted peppercorns in my life and the seller is very professional and quick with shipment highly recommended

positive,7/7/21,good product that we are all accustomed to at a very reasonable price i do have to be cautious to not over salt when using this so i tend to use more fresh garlic and add this in lieu of salt in equal quantities
positive,18/6/21,i love the bitter taste of chocolate so i did some research on cocoa and found mostly positive reviews of raw cocoa i did however find one negative review saying that theobromide the primary stimulant in cocoa is unhealthy and has similar side effects as caffeine i got the powder anyways to dispel the mystery myself while i did have a small crash afterwards after tablespoons the surge in energy that i felt was definitely worth it it was not the jittery surge i was warned about and the crash actually helps me sleep if i time it right not to mention the taste is so good and yet mild that i could eat it by the spoonful on its own thinking that was the end of it i also ordered cocoa nibs terrible mistake i don t know exactly why but i got the exact side effects i was warned about not to mention the energy was lower in quality this is definitely the better alternative
positive,7/7/21,there is a lot of variability in the quality of macadamians even from the same producer i ve only received one bag of these but they are perfect i ve run across many that have had varying degrees of bitterness usually accompanied by an unnaturally hard consistency as though they had been harvested too early not these they have perfect consistency and flavor the vast majority are whole as opposed to halves or smaller pieces update i ve now ordered about bags over a period of about a year the quality has be consistently excellent i use macadamia nuts as a regular part of my diet they preferentially reduce bad cholesterol due to their high content of monounsaturated fats they are low in carbs and have very few simple carbs so they will not only take the edge off your appetite they will help keep it off unlike most nuts they are low in oxalate which means regular use will not increase the risk of kidney stones pistachios and walnuts are also low in oxalate the only catch is that their high healthy fat content means high calorie count per unit volume to dodge that bullet i just ration them out as opposed to absentmindedly eating from a large container this is a great product i m happy to give them yet another star review
positive,1/7/21,best quality oil i ve encountered i was impressed with the packaging for shipping nice job

positive,14/10/21,these were freakin awesome all lbs were top quality and better than many restaurants ordering my second batch now how i prepare them place several legs in a pot of boiling water for about a minute or less if you stir them they are already cooked so you just want to heat them up cooking them further will ruin them the end piece will piece will take a bit longer

positive,1/3/21,definitely the way to go when you buy the base unit grasses last a long time if you give good light and sufficient water i wouldn t buy this without the base to save money though because the wooden base keeps the grass tray from moving and tipping over when kitties munch on it good quality great value

positive,20/4/21,when i first adopted my dog i did a vast amount of research to find out what was truly best to feed him he s a chihuahua mix and as i was reading such mixed reviews about whether small dogs would benefit from a high protein diet or not i decided i just had to try it for myself he did have a little trouble with digestion while i was transitioning him to the food he was eating royal canin prior he s been eating it for about seven months now and he s doing phenomenal he has great muscle tone and energy his coat is silky and shinny when it had been coarse and dull yes it s on the pricey side but if you closely watch what you put in your body as humans why wouldn t you want your best friend to benefit from great food
positive,21/4/21,i was anxious to try making my own ijera at home after living in ethiopia for months and have had fairly good success with this tef flour it is the dark variety but i enjoy the great almost mocha flavor i can tell it is fresh because it develops a good sour starter on its own without needing to add any additional sourdough starter or yeast

positive,15/7/21,i use a lot of seeds for making breads salad dressings and in other cooking these are excellent sesame seeds the only drawback is that it takes a while to use up two packages and unless you are careful to keep the seeds cool and out of the sun they lose a little quality after a few months toast them to bring out the flavor grind them up when making salad dressings and add them to your other ingredients to add new flavor to your dressings i toss a handful into salads onto cooked vegetable or add them to marinades for poultry and meats sesame is very versatile and healthy eating

positive,13/10/21,i ve used fenugreek in the past to increase milk production when i was breast feeding while i m currently not breastfeeding i decided to start taking it again the reason it makes your body odors smell like maple syrup as weird as this may seem i just wanted to be able to sweat and not smell like onions and this did the job after taking it for one day no side effects other than it does seem to make your bust fuller not drastically hardly noticeable but i can tell a slight difference i gave it stars since this particular brand seems to be pretty potent compared to what i used to take i noticed the maple syrup smell after a few days with the old stuff this worked after one day and doesn t have a weird smell to it making it easy for me to swallow
positive,19/2/21,i don t normally use honey but i drink a fair amount of tea and wanted something healthier than white sugar or products like splenda etc just got two one pound jars of really raw honey and i must say it s much nicer than what i m used to at the local grocery store it s packed in glass jars which is the proper way to pack honey it can absorb things from plastics plus its totally unfiltered yet seems more sophisticated in both taste and texture than the super market stuff it s a solid so it s less messy than the liquid variety i just made a cup of tea and dipped a spoon into the honey and it scoops easily up and melted into my tea right away if you think honey is too cumbersome to use reconsider i can t honestly say this brand is better than others in its class but it is definitely nicer than the typical filtered liquid plastic squeeze container variety found in most super market brands addendum april my latest jars have been lbs oz sizes these have been packed in plastic not glass jars unlike my lb jars were if this is of concern to you contact mfgr to ask about glass jar options edit feb i should add that i buy direct from really raw their price includes shipping within the continental us fyi

positive,24/3/21,this is a great bargain the beans are all terrific and look very fresh and clean i would have given it five stars if only it were easier to store lol its kind of a bulky heavy bag but hey its still great and i have not had a single batch fail me i will order this item again for sure

positive,19/2/21,very happy with these beans they re very fresh very fragrant and arrived quickly i used the whole package to make a gigantic batch of vanilla extract to give as christmas gifts i split all the beans lengthwise and added them to a ml bottle of vodka shaking about once per week for several months to package i strain the extract through a goldtone coffee filter into a gift sized bottle and add a section of vanilla bean to the bottle the flavor is excellent and much cheaper than buying vanilla extract at the store also i put any leftover pieces of vanilla bean into my sugar canister leave them out to dry first for yummy vanilla sugar highly recommended

positive,1/6/21,i have enjoyed many pr s up to dollars a pound and have a very good sense of quality this is about an month as stated it is on the mild side which is quite special in itself it has a fresh wonderful buttery taste of a fresh pr there is individual merit for the various ages up to months i personally do not like the months variety this is a bargain and to be well appreciated pay the next day during the hot months mt second order weeks later was not fresh dried out not the young freshness and tenderness of a month did not taste good why we really like these cheese the third shipment was perfect

positive,19/2/21,i compared so many different dog food brands before i settled on blue buffalo i used to feed my swiss mountain dogs holistic anchovy until they changed the recipe to include pork and chicken meal presumably to save blue buffalo has none of that in it and it gets delivered to my front door in two days with amazon prime call me a nut but i always taste the food i feed my dogs so i can get a real idea of what i am feeding them because let us be honest most of our dogs would eat anything that you put in front of them let us just say that blue buffalo had a lot more of an authentic fish and oatmeal taste and texture than holistic or eagle pack did i also add a little pro biotic to their food to help with digestion i will be buying blue buffalo in the future for my boys
positive,14/12/20,we sent this basket to my mother in law for mother s day and she loved it i was worried because she will definitely let us know if she doesn t like something and she really raved about this i didn t see the basket in person but she said the items in it were all very nice she was most excited about a package of soap petals that was included she said they looked just like dried flowers but you use one petal at a time as soap she ll be using those in her guest bathroom the food items were all really good quality and there was a really nice picture frame in the box too she also raved about the box itself and plans on using it on it s own this is the rd art of appreciation gift basket i ve sent as gifts and i always get good responses so i d feel confident about sending this as a gift

positive,22/7/19,package was received at expected time more importantly the walnuts are fresh of good size and excellent flavor no preservatives such as bht which some other companies use
positive,2/2/20,i only write reviews when i get crappy product crappy service or excellent product and service these beans were moist and plump the smell is heavenly in fact i placed the envelope they were mailed in into my lingerie drawer because throwing it away seemed to be a huge waste of fragrance i have placed the beans in vodka and bourbon and altough it will be some time before i have vanilla extract i am excited about the end result i couldn t believe how quickly the beans arrived i ve bought books that were shipped from a few states over that took times as long to get here and cost more to ship i will definitely order from this company again and again and again
positive,31/8/19,i recently discovered freeze dried foods and these garlic bits are very nice yes expensive but i mainly use them when i bake bread these do taste like garlic and re hydrate very well target carries a line of freeze dried herbs cost a little cheaper and get little more and i will compare those to these
positive,22/7/19,i loved these peanuts they were just so good all of them and they came just as advertised
positive,12/1/20,i am a tuna snob this tuna is close in quality to the best tuna i have had and works well for making large qauntities when the best tuna is cost prohibitive i mix with cannelini beans olive oil generous amount and chopped red onions for a great meal with greens or bread or both

positive,26/9/20,i use lots of bay leaves when cooking and find many brands lack the bright pungency that adds a special touch to a dish these have a nice bright green color they flavor dishes quite nicely i was surprised to find that these were as good as those of spice islands which i have tended to prefer over all other brands
positive,22/7/19,this is one of the best traditional pasta sauces around usually i would mix some oregano some basil and some garlic powder to give my gravy some taste but this doesn t need any additional items it s great just out of the jar

positive,22/11/20,this is very good quality foil i can t find a difference between this recycled and virgin
positive,30/3/20,just ordered my nd bag from this company wish the bag wasn t so flimsy i had to double bag it after opening but other than that excellent quality seeds and very prompt delivery
positive,8/7/20,i bought this seed to make centerpieces for a safari themed baby shower i did a test run with one planter last week they sprouted beautifully and close to germination the grass is tall and healthy within only days
positive,4/1/20,i ordered this as pumpkin seems to be in very short supply this year i was unable to find it at any of my three local grocery stores the quality of this is excellent

positive,2/2/20,the tassimo machine with it s disc technology is an amazing product the convenience of being able to select so many different hot beverages in one machine is beneficial to our business our company uses the tassimo in our showroom so customers may enjoy the best quality beverage while browsing our displays thumbs up

positive,18/6/20,i like these they are short enough to be cute but stretch enough to cover everything vital they are very comfortable and stretchy not too tight they wash up nice without pilling and i have had no problem with the gold rear design peeling or coming off
positive,20/8/20,this dried pineapple is of very good quality the pineapple pieces are of a good size and moist my year old daughter loves them and requests them for her school snack pack
positive,4/7/21,the beans came well packaged and in time we have never had a problem with these beans they have always been good in quality
positive,5/2/20,i have been buying pig ears for my brother dogs for over ten years these were the best quality that i ever purchase they were bigger and the quality is just as good then what i purchase from other online stores
positive,22/7/19,trophy nut these are excellent quality fresh cashews roasted dry not oily snack size packs are convenient for take along
positive,2/2/20,these tahitian vanilla beans were just what i was looking for i was very glad that they were more or less the same size thickness however there were a couple in one of my orders and one bean in another that had some mould growing on them so i had to toss some that was the only downside they even arrived a little early too
positive,22/11/20,my husband and i really enjoy this product we purchase it from a german baptist bulk foods store in town and have tried the black currant and the blueberry i was rather skeptical when my husband brought the bottle over to me to see what i thought but figured we d try it for the price we re not sorry as it is very quality flavor easy to mix and great for the price as you dilute it party syrup to parts water i actually use more water because we don t want it very sweet i would highly recommend this product
positive,1/3/20,espresso pods are a no fuss no muss way to go i use the mypressi espresso maker which i love and pods make clean up a snap the lucaffe mixed case includes two skus i kind of wish there s been more but both are so tasty i can t complain they also arrived loose in a box which was surprising for me but not a particular problem five stars because both my complaints are trivial and are irrelevant to the quality of the product
positive,23/11/20,this is a high quality tea you can instantly tell the difference between this earl grey and the other more commons ones you find in the grocery store they are of such quality you can steep twice for two cups instead of one
positive,5/4/21,very good product the increase did less to change my subscription i love this product and will continue buying in future
positive,27/4/20,this was the second time i ve ordered the lbs bag from amazon both times i ve gotten the freshest good plenty s i ve ever gotten i get them at the store or at the movies and they are tough even hard i loved them and thought that s just how they came until i had them soft and chewy awesome
positive,8/3/21,good looking good hand feeling stable with cold and hot water shift i got them within hours after i placed the order
positive,2/2/20,i have found this product to be a good quality organic tea that you can drink everyday without breaking the bank i like to vary the types of tea i drink throughout the day so this one is just fine by my standards and enjoyable to drink
positive,26/1/21,i ve been drinking lots and lots of tea over the past few months as i work through a low carb diet regime i had been buying varieties at the grocery store and decided it would be economical to simply buy a large sampler with that in mind i randomly chose bentley s finest tea classic collection i couldn t have been more pleased with the quality of the tea the peach tea is in fact my favorite in the collection but the english breakfast tea made me a fan of that flavor where i never had been before i ll be watching for other tea collections from bentley s
positive,9/1/21,we travel to va frequently i used to buy these there as favors for neighbors and then have the hassle of getting them back home now i just order from amazon to arrive on the day we get home the price is much less and no shipping hassles the quality is excellent i ve tried the costco version and they are just not as good and nowhere near as good as planters or others
positive,30/10/20,these are quality hot stuffed peppers they are filled with tuna and anchovies and not bread crump fillers like almost all the other stuffed products the quality pepper as well as stuffing makes the product stand out and also explains the extra cost a healthy product with unsaturated vegetable fat respectfully submitted
positive,29/1/21,i got the sampler pack and was in general very happy with the coffees i generally prefer my coffee on the intense side no not burnt but with a lot of flavor so i found the corner donut shop to be too mild for my taste but cyclone was much more in line with my preferences the coffee was all really fresh for a k cup i found the ones marked extra bold to have the right amount of taste while the regulars were passable now that i ve sampled the variety i m ready to move on to the specific blends that match my palate
positive,24/10/21,expensive but so far is the best green tea i could find coconut green is my favorite flavor amazing i will definitely order more
positive,24/10/21,the quality of these dates is fantastic however they need to be chopped smaller and more uniformly most people probably used chopped dates for recipies and i cannot imagine a recipe that would call for dates that are this coarsely chopped
positive,16/10/21,this is by far the best chili seasoning mix i ve found in years i especially like that there s no salt in the mix the rich chili flavor it produces is unequaled by anything i ve found elsewhere it reminds me of the quality that was around when i was a child
positive,24/10/21,securely stores every precious ounce of breast milk they are biodegradable easy to use because they are large and stand up sturdily i love these
positive,25/9/21,these are wrapped neatly in bundles with ties around each bundle so you can select the amount you need after opening each package using boiling water with a small amount of oil these cook up rapidly it is necessary to cool these down with cold water after they ve been drained to avoid sticking like most other noodles the noodles themselves are very tasty and make an authentic lo mein i recommend these and will order more when these are gone that may not be for a while though as these are packed in a case of packages just be sure you don t overcook them it only takes about minutes to boil them soft
positive,19/10/21,the flavors in this product are absolutely fabulous naturally smoked lending a delicate natural flavor of smoke the only reason why i didn t rate a star is that i find the little pellets do not dissolve well into cold dishes unlike the flaked style salts
positive,19/10/21,these little buggers are tough to find so i was happy to get a big pack at a good price online my daughter is content with these as a reward for doing something well and at calories a piece not all that unhealthy
positive,15/6/21,these are a cheap alternative for summer when everyone wants a cold treat superior flavor and size than the fla vor ice case
positive,18/7/21,this product was everything and more according to the advertisement i was totally satisfied with my purchase i recommend to everyone to purchase these chips from this site
positive,18/10/21,this is a delicious recipe and ingredients and the one i use a bit pricy but if you don t mind the price point it makes a wonderful waffle combine this with a waring waffle maker and you could be in waffle heaven
positive,15/6/21,first time buyer of ka me rice crackers and i m very impressed these are very light crisp and flavorful they are as good plain as they are with cold cuts fruit etc unfortunately the ones i purchased may be the last i get from this source right after i purchased the dozen packs the price per dozen increased to its present fortunately i have enough to last a while but assuming the price stays the same these are my last ka me
positive,4/8/21,i got tired of overpaying for tea at teavana so decided to try this brand of oolong tea and was pleasantly surprised it has a wonderful flavor and like the previous reviewer i just put the bag in a tea ball to compensate for the poor quality of the bags you just can t beat the value of this tea
positive,8/6/21,dop san marzano canned tomatoes are the finest canned tomatoes on the planet but i can get these for literally half the price at my local grocery store is this unusual boston is pretty heavily italian in some areas maybe that makes a difference i don t understand why anyone would buy them at this price check your local grocery store before you buy them at this price
positive,15/6/21,i used these for my sons birthday party as one of the sweet treats to have out they are great the kids all loved them and the price was fabulous way better than purchasing elsewhere the item came as described and was fresh thank you amazon com
positive,4/8/21,yes these are wonderful and healthy cookies but this is a rare bad deal from amazon really dab nutrition they are charging about including shipping in less than a minute of web searching i found the same quantity for about shipped enjoy the cookies but buy from someone else until the price comes down
positive,25/9/21,if you love green tea then you will be impressed with this green tea powder the instructions say to add one packet to ounces of cold water but i d recommend you try two packets and one packet oz of stevia the flavor of the tea with only one packet is fairly mild so mild in fact that you can barely taste the green tea flavor when you order this tea you will get six boxes with packets in each if you use two packets per bottle of water you get drinks that is only cents per drink if you get free shipping i ordered some books too i think that is fairly reasonable i look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices a website is given for additional recipes there are a few interesting recipes like the ones for white chocolate green tea ice cream green tea papaya nectar and green tea sugar cookies you will probably find many uses for this and i ve even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea just use one packet per ounces of hot water no brewing required this tea dissolves very easily in hot or ice cold water i can highly recommend it to you the rebecca review
positive,4/9/21,i ve tried a handful of other brands of french roast and i find this one and tully s version to be both great and comparable in flavor the difference is the price this one is far more reasonable
positive,31/8/21,these are great spices to use on all food types giving a great flavor the bottle sizes are twice the size of that found in a supermarket and about the same price so you get more of what you would normally pay for
positive,9/10/21,great option for excellent taste price and convenience a repeat customer on these we order these now in the pack instead of getting at the grocery store
positive,15/6/21,i like to brew a k cup cocoa into my coffee for a nice mocha this dark chocolate flavor is quite nice especially mixed with double black diamond coffee though not the very best it is good and the price is right compared to other brands
positive,4/8/21,my kids have been begging for hot cocoa k cups and when i found these so reasonably priced i decided to give them a try we all loved them
positive,15/6/21,we purchase this food for our two boxers and great dane the dane has an allergy to chicken and one of the boxers has a weak stomach so this food is perfect for them all three dogs love it even the picky one and it seems to agree with their digestive tracts more than any other dog food that we ve tried i can t begin to tell you how pleased i am about that i did a lot of research to find a quality food that isn t full of filler and won t break the bank i am pleased with this food more so than any of the other more expensive brands that i ve tried
positive,4/8/21,it s amazing how little popularity that diamond pet foods seems to have considering the quality ingredients their foods contain i worked at a pet store for about four years our number one recommendations on foods were natural balance and wellness two exceptional foods that are pretty expensive but for those owners who have multiple dogs or even one large breed dog those brands can cripple your budget so when i would get customers who absolutely loved their pets and wanted to be able to feed them healthy food without breaking their banks i recommended diamond diamond dog food costs about the same as those commercial brands like purina and iams but contains only natural healthy ingredients just remember the less garbage you feed your dog by products fillers the less your dog uses the bathroom and they stay fuller longer
positive,15/6/21,great for stocking up and keeping a few in the closet i like to buy things in bulk and this was a good deal and smells good too
positive,4/8/21,these arrived fresh and in very good shape just like buying from the local store only cheaper and delivered to my door
positive,1/10/21,years ago i bought a digidesign protools rack and a lot of other equipment to start recording but i could never get it to work with my os on either computer i was at an impasse for a long time until i saw this product on blue s website i already had a condenser mic in the closet i had never gotten to use and didn t want to spend more money on a quality usb mic i couldn t be happy that this product exists in it s quality or price i noticed no noise or coloration of the signal and it worked without a problem it does exactly what it s suppose to do act like it doesn t exist it just serves it purpose to convert the signal well and stays out of the way on everything else it does feel light weight and the signal was a little lower than i thought as many reviews said and that is the only reason i didn t give it stars but i don t think that should keep anyone from getting this product
positive,1/7/18,i have a keurig coffee maker you know the one with the k cups to have a coffee like this you have to have a special filter which i do have honestly you ll spend a crapload of money on k cups if you don t get the filter for regular ground coffee anyway i don t know if it was because the coffee was ground or filtered a special way but the water in my keurig had a hard time seeping through causing a bit of an overflow aside from that the taste was smooth and flavorful it has a coffee taste plain and simple is it anything special not really it just tastes good and is reasonably priced
positive,10/8/18,i ve used this bbq sauce before and it is good especially considering that is free of so many negatives like corn syrup and for us gluten but the price on this can t be right order directly from the daddy sam s website to pay oz bottle this price would have to be a case price although the description says oz
positive,1/7/18,year old elkhound loves this food and it keeps her in great health amazon has the best price i ve found for this food and it s even better with subscribe and save i highly recommend it
positive,13/9/18,i m no coffee snob but this is still much better than crap you get a starbucks i drink black coffee so flavor really matters when its not covered by caramel and other junk great coffee for a great price especially if you get it when amazon is offering the off coupon
positive,17/7/18,not the best coffee but it is not bad as well we bought more after we tried the first time because for the price we ve got it is fine godiva is still our favorite but this one is okay too
positive,16/1/19,i was a little worried about the other reviews that said their wrappers were broken i wonder if they were pushing the wrappers they suggested both suggested the same wrappers hmmm however the wrappers arrived intact in fact we took two packages camping and the left overs made it home without damage i detected no difference from the rice wrappers we buy locally at an asian market buying in bulk saved lots of there were a couple of wrappers out of dozens that had a few tiny air bubble holes in them it didn t affect the taste or function that is the reason for stars instead of we weren t wrapping anything that was really drippy so it wasn t a problem we will definitely order again shipping was rapid a great buying experience
positive,16/1/19,these are guaranteed to be a hit with my kids like regular gummy bears but even better with extra flavor perfect consistency not too chewy great all the way around
positive,1/8/20,excellent we have enjoyed yuban coffee for many years we recently tried the dark roast coffee and would recommend it if you want a rich tasting coffee smooth with no bitterness beats the high price of many gourmet coffees without sacrificing that delicious flavor that coffee lovers look for
positive,1/7/18,there is nothing wrong with this product but it is overpriced with a little research you can buy this for less than half the price buyer beware
positive,10/8/18,tried this because it is kona and much cheaper than the other national brands i have been using what can i say i am greatly surprised mild no bite too it and no discernable acidity this is on my shopping list from now on
positive,15/2/20,my daughter loves these dinners there s no other organic meat option at my grocery store so we re stuck with this one but i don t mind at all i think they re great i agree that they are runny but you can just thicken it with whole grain cereal and problem solved turkey dinner is thick enough i also don t understand why people complain that they are too sweet or unhealthy first of all if you don t like the ingredients buy something else second i trust earth s best enough to believe they know the right amount of stuff to put in their product third the belief that if baby tastes sweet food they will not eat regular food is an old wife s tale are you people saying that you don t give your babies fruit and vegetables they are all sweet the only reason i gave this particular item stars instead of five is the price i can buy it at my grocery store for cents a jar here they are being sold for over cents and that s at the sale price if you buy these at the regular price it comes to way too much
positive,22/4/21,i purchased this food on amazon then saw it at babies r us for cents less per jar i like the product but amazon is overcharging
positive,25/9/20,with the amazon mom discount this is cheaper than in stores unless there s a sale it regularly goes on sale at kroger publix and other grocery stores for around cents a jar i wish there were other earth s best fruit varieties available on amazon at this price no problems with breakage during shipping for me but i found the packaging annoying in general though i think earth s best is a good brand and that the price is fair for what you re getting organic non gmo baby food delivered to your door step as a single mom in a rural community going to the grocery store with the baby can be such a hassle earth s best is definitely better tasting and smelling than non organic foods like gerber the textures are good but i had to stay on st foods longer than six months because the textures of almost all nd foods made my son gag i had a similar issue graduating from nd foods to rd foods sprout baby food however is the best quality i ve tried for freshness aroma and taste it reminds me of pureed fresh produce while i ve seen it in winn dixie for the same price as earth s best it s much more expensive on amazon and the selection of flavors is relatively limited both in stores and online i m going to start making my own organic baby food and freezing it but i ll probably always keep a few jars of earth s best to get by in a pinch
positive,16/11/19,i was very pleased with the price of this product and the shipping speed was fast i like that i didn t have to lug this back from the grocery store thanks amazon
positive,9/9/20,i bought this for my year old and he loves it just as much as the other organic brands we ve purchased but i got this one for less great buy
positive,15/1/20,we have been looking for pesto that tastes as good as what we had in tuscany this is from the same region as our favorite the consistency is just a bit runny it has moderate chunks of garlic it was quite tasty
positive,1/9/20,yuban is one of the best coffees available but not sold in all areas amazon s case price is unbeatable i get a case every weeks always on time
positive,22/7/21,i m constantly trying to find vanilla beans at a reasonable price often when i do they are hard as rocks dry and practically unusable i was so frustrated at safeway where one bean was dry and hard as a rock the best i ve found was at trader joe s where i could get three beans for they were decent this price was so reasonable that i worried they were not going to be fresh good etc i was wrong the beans were incredibly fresh and supple i m using them to make vanilla extract and they have worked perfectly they keep well in the fridge so i m using them in everything the price is great but there might be too many to use if that s the case then split them with a friend then it becomes one of the best culinary deals ever absolutely wonderful i will buy these again and again
positive,1/7/18,i received these wonderful beans today through amazon i have not opened the vacuum sealed bag yet but the fragrance is divine they are about inches long and plump and soft it looks like there are maybe beans
positive,10/8/18,i got these weeks ago for the price i was not expecting much but they are really fresh and fragrant i ve used them to make bavarian cream and creme brulee and they taste great
positive,14/5/21,this is the buy of a lifetime for about beans instead of for and the flavor was great made ice cream that everyone raved about i vacuum sealed portions for future use to keep them as fresh as possible
positive,17/10/19,my boston terriers love these treats they are natural wholesome and soft enough to break into multiple pieces we keep a steady supply of them in the house i order at least containers at a time since we don t want to run out amazon s seller all pets has the best price around
positive,3/10/21,i started loving oolong tea after i discovered a bottled product called tejava that product is over a dollar for a ounce bottle i needed something less expensive so i tried this prince of peace brand oolong after a few brewing experiments i now love this stuff what i have learned if brewing as sun tea this type of tea seems to come out very weak if you put this tea in boiling water it may come out bitter i now heat up my water in a microwave until it is very hot to the touch but no way near boiling i then put in the tea bags and let it brew for about twenty minutes i like strong tea i have to my taste duplicated the tejava brew at a fraction of the original cost enjoy ken
positive,15/9/20,great product and priced well we ve ordered this several times over the past few years and really like their walnut oil packaged well and ships on time will keep ordering this product from the same seller
positive,30/8/20,i love the walnut oil it came in cans which i like a lot because you hardly see them any more the walnut oil was better quality than any of the walnut oil i bought in my neighbourhood and cheaper even with the shipping charge i recommend it to anyone
positive,1/7/18,one of my favorite salad recipes i make often calls for walnut oil i bought a small bottle from a local major grocery store and it was over for about ounces steep i love walnuts so naturally i loved this oil from my very first taste but the price was not right so i searched on the internet and found this i was a little reluctant to buy cans as i thought they go rancid before i can finish but i am now on my last can i use it in place of evoo to make other vinaigrettes too or just splash this walnut oil and my favorite raspberry vinegar and b s or seasons salt like krazy salt over spring mix it is an easy but great green salad i do this a lot when i need a quick side anyway this oil goes well with anything and it does not taste too nutty just a touch of nice walnut flavor of course i love walnuts so even if it tastes very walnutty i would still like it anyway it is a great product and i will buy the same pack again
positive,21/10/19,trying something new with this coffee didn t blow me away but for the price it s excellent i don t have anything bad to say about it other than it s a big bag and i am mildly concerned with freshness toward the end but we burn thru beans pretty fast d
positive,8/9/20,tea s are very personal and everyone has their favorites i really enjoy this tea when relaxing or before bed the subtle mint flavor seems to comfort and sooth a little sugar i m not a fan of honey really makes all the flavors pop being a fan of this tea it was a no brainer to order it in bulk the price at the time was great cheaper then the grocery store by far the packaging was efficient and made it really easy to store
positive,2/10/20,this squeezy fruit as my daughter calls it is great convenient yummy no added sugar i love it i just don t understand why it is so expensive i find it at the grocery store for for a four pack don t pay this price that s crazy
positive,4/7/21,amazon has the best price in town hot nuts that don t disappoint i would recommend trying dave s other items as well great flavor
positive,21/9/21,this is one of the best hot dogs made unfortunatally it is not widely available citymade must be off their rocker if they think people are going to sale hot dogs for such a crazy price granted there is weiners in a package still a stupid price
positive,11/9/21,the stuff is great but i ll pay at most or for four bottles
positive,12/10/21,these raw shelled pumpkin seed kernels actually have a slight pumpkin flavor which i assume indicates that they are fresh unlike the store bought h e b raw kernels that were pretty bland they are also extremely nutritious high in iron protein and fiber actually pumpkin seed kernels have four times the iron and about more protein than beef per gram the price produces somewhat of a sticker shock though at over seven bucks per pound however considering all of the fiber and nutrients i believe they are well worth the price bob s red mill has the nutrition facts displayed on his web site i highly recommend these pumpkin kernels because they taste great and as you can from the facts below are at the top of the nutrition chart usda nutrition content seeds pumpkin and squash seed kernels dried protein fiber total dietary folate food niacin vitamin b riboflavin thiamin vitamin c total ascorbic acid vitamin a rae vitamin e alpha tocopherol calcium ca iron fe phosphorus p magnesium mg copper cu selenium se zinc zn
positive,11/10/21,i gave this item as a gift and the recipient has not yet made the dish for which i gave it to her a foie gras dish but i must say this price for a french truffle is amazing i suspect most of us do not have the palates to appreciate the truffles good for those of you who do but for the rest of us this is a good choice linda morse
positive,28/9/21,always used the robertsons ginger this production is almost as good but the price is inflated for the size of the jar the product was packed well glass jars and arrived promptly
positive,4/7/21,my border collies expect one of these each night before bed i ve learned how important it is to create regular routines to keep these active wired dogs calm and there s no way i have time to brush their teeth each nite even if they d let me but this can get very expensive when i found them here at this price i ordered tons then went back and ordered more figuring the price would increase to that on other sites it had increased a bit but still a great price entirely pets delivered a bit late due to supply problems but that was okay since i had just received enough to last a month
positive,11/9/21,i have always been a fan of annie s products and since i m overseas at the moment i didn have access to the products that s where amazon comes in the price is very good almost the same as buying them in the store in the states and the product came in great shape and the expiration date is not soon either as for the product itself i think the sauce can use less salt but other wise i love it natural ingredients and it takes less than minutes for me to make it
positive,12/9/21,this is a great price for powdered goat milk at the local health food store the only place in town that carries goat milk i buy just one of these cans for for three cans is the best price i ve found i use goat milk for my children when they are in the process of weaning and as long as they want it it is so much healthier than formula because well it s not soy or dairy based and has no chemicals and added vitamins that try to mimic breastmilk goat milk is more similar to breastmilk than dairy so is much easier for humans to digest than cow milk i find it to be a great alternative for babies as they adjust or for those who cannot tolerate dairy for warm bottles for my month old i just heat water on the stove then pour it into her glass bottle with a scoop of goat milk shake it up and she has her favorite drink other than momma s milk of course
positive,13/7/21,this is a great deal for the amount of pretzel packs that are given we love these since they re only calories each and perfect for a snack pair with a sandwich or just to stick in your purse if you get hungry
positive,22/9/21,i got this product for consumption i took some of the store bought baking soda and did not know it is loaded with aluminum so glad i was able to find this product thru amazon and after reading all the positive reviews i got it and started taking some with a glass of water great product fast delivery great price very happy with my purchase
positive,4/7/21,i ve drunk whole bean tanzanian peaberry for about years my first source was the large national retailer and wholesaler green mountain which roasted their tanzanian peaberry light to medium although the beans made good coffee green mountain s price eventually became higher than i thought reasonable an internet seach led me to a small family owned and family operated roaster in tennessee their beans were also light to medium and thus had a dry appearance that level of roasting was to my liking because the beans retain more caffeine and the natural flavor of the coffee is more apparent than with darker roasts when the tennessee roaster s computer system crashed and online sales were temporarily suspended i did another internet search and found amazon s tanzanian peaberry roasted by coffee bean direct it has essentially the same good taste as the tanzanian peaberry from the tennessee roaster and the price is lower i m totally satisfied with the beans roasted by coffee bean direct and the shipping by amazon is quick enough that buying three pounds at a time allows me to place my next order before the current one runs out
positive,11/9/21,these individually packed milk is great for on the road does not need to be stored in the frig this item came in packs of then shipped in its original box and then another amazon box over it the content was securely packed and i was not worried that the milk got dirty during shipping the price is the same as in local grocery store but shipping to the house saved me from dragging them from the store while my toddler is jumping up and down the store aisle the only reason that i did not give it stars is because of the expiration date it is mar which is not too far away i just bought one from target because i forgot to bring one and my toddler was restless and it has an expiration date of sept overall i would still recommend to buy from amazon
positive,8/8/21,i m new to tofu newly vegan and was dismayed at the price of tofu in local health food stores and the scarcity of it in regular grocery stores i was hesitant to purchase in bulk but am so glad i did i purchased both the soft and the firm versions and it has been great in every recipe i will definitely be ordering again
positive,4/7/21,i buy these with subscribe and save i like the flavor and aroma going on month two and i am not tired of them yet
positive,11/9/21,i do like this coffee but even with subscribe and save amazon s price is higher than k cups at bed bath beyond convenience is one thing but since there are bb bs all around me it s pretty easy to pick up my coffee there and save a few bucks i wish amazon would price their coffees more competitively i d buy here exclusively if they did but this is good medium roast coffee not quite as strong as i d like but a little stronger than the breakfast in bed version i may need to try sorrento and see if it s a little bolder
positive,24/10/21,a nutritionist recommended these to sweeten my coffee etc as there are no negative after effects unlike artificial sweeteners stevia is made from herb in south america japanese tea drinkers have been using stevia for years with no ill effects she said it s quite a bit sweeter than sugar so you need less of it as a replacement i like this brand and put two packets in my iced coffee every morning with almond milk and t cocoa it tastes like a coffee milk shake for only about calories as the stevia is calorie free the stevia makes it taste like an iced dessert drink and is a great refreshing treat for the day this multi pack offer for this price is about lower than what i can get nustevia for locally
positive,10/7/21,i am very fond of this coffee and i won t accept substitutes for it several of my local stores have substituted another brand i just order it on line when i cannot get it in a store however amazon s price is too high it s a jar in local stores
positive,4/7/21,is this price for a single ounce jar or for a pack the description only indicates that the price is for ounces which of course is ridiculously expensive but it s a good deal if it s for a pack previous buyers can you please advise the coffee itself is excellent i usually buy it in the store and was hoping to find a deal on amazon
positive,11/9/21,this is a great product but for oz really you can get it from other sellers or at the grocery store for show this price gouger what the market will really bear
positive,20/9/21,so far this has been a great way to order my favorite coffee it has become really hard to find it at the local stores but amazon had it even cheaper than i previously paid for it it arrived very quickly and i am waiting any day now for the next shipment
positive,13/10/21,this food looks just like something you would make for your pet at a thanksgiving day dinner i was impressed with it when i opened the can and my cats were when they ate it it contains nice size pieces of shredded turkey not too big making it easy for my kitties to eat they have gotten the tiki cat chicken before and the long stringy pieces in that kept them busy for a little bit and they seemed kind of tough even for me when i would try to break them up not this i just spooned it into their bowls and they took over from there there is liquid around the sides of the food in the center but the meat vege mix in the middle is well packed i didn t feel like i was getting more liquid than food like halo foods so i was happy about that as well plus through amazon this is a great price for this quality food
positive,2/8/21,i ve tried several brands and this is true to the taste of fresh coconut water though slightly more dilute the wholesale price here doesn t make much sense to me it s about per liter in an pack i get it for at publix the only disadvantage is that they only have maybe or at a time but i m one of few buying it and i sweep the shelves of it lol i m weeks pregnant and this helps decrease the swelling in my legs and keeps me well hydrated i don t experience any leg cramps like i did during my first pregnancy i think the potassium makes a huge difference and with a tendency towards gestational diabetes the low sugar content vs other sports drinks is a huge advantage they should market this directly to pregnant women with diabetes with no renal issues
positive,11/6/21,i get these for at my local health food store their price sucks it is one of the best tasting coconut waters around though
positive,2/8/21,if you want kopi luwak this is a good method to acquire some in a relatively cheap manner it s not as good as some of the stuff i ve had but it s definitely in that special class that kopi luwak belongs in i ve served this for guest given it as gifts and enjoyed it on special occasions i ve made it in french press drip and in one special instance espresso to truly enjoy it use about grams of beans per ounces of hot water used to brew this is the appropriate ratios serve black no cream or sugar as this will ruin your treat this bean isn t for everyone but don t worry it s not an acquired taste its just a different taste product arrived fast thank to prime fresh as i wanted and the beans tasted just like they do when i buy them locally from rao s bakery here in tx same beans same company
positive,18/10/21,this has become our new coffee of choice for the mornings it s a good price for a solid cup of organic coffee beans are medium roast and very fragrant
positive,23/7/21,i am not much on stuff like this but having some issued that i think this item will take care of i got some here local shops did not carry it prices at flea markets and food shops were just to high the price from amazon was very good i no longer have need of this item but if the condition returns so will i here
positive,11/6/21,these may last forever at t every day in my morning shake since i m having trouble finding recipes for other ways to use these seeds but they will keep in a sealed plastic container
positive,2/8/21,kind of expensive for cheese product would expect ssomething closer to the per pound price i can get in the supermarket but it is so versatile can be used in any recipe that calls for cheese my favorite use is to super cheese both store brand and even kraft boxed mac n cheese sometimes that little packet of cheese powder just doesn t give me the cheese i ness i want so after mixing the mac n cheese according to the directions on the box i put a few slices of velveeta on top nuke it for a few minutes mix it in and viola try it you ll never want to eat mac n cheese out of the box again
positive,9/7/21,costco stopped carrying this near me so when i found out it was on amazon for cheaper i was so excited it came pretty quick was at an unbeatable price and was the same good hot cereal i got from the costco no damage or anything
positive,22/6/21,i have purchased green coffee beans from several local and internet providers often with poor results you roast them is the exception i have never had bad service with this company and now purchase all of my coffee from them they provide an excellent selection of high quality beans at great prices they do a great job with packaging and shipping most of my orders have shipped the same day i ordered i have tried most of their coffees and have yet to be disappointed if you are looking for a good mid priced coffee i would recommend la minita tarrazu de costa rica i highly recommend you check out you roast them for all your coffee needs
positive,2/8/21,nutiva organic hemp seeds are so good for you they are protein omega and gla i think the msrp on these bags is each so amazon has these priced at almost half price this is a great affordable way to get some healthy proteins and fats amazon sent me very fresh product i subscribed n saved on july nd and it arrived via ontrac on july th the nutiva hempseed package says it was packed on may and is best before may pretty fresh product and tastes fresh too sprinkle on top of your cereal omelets yogurt soups salads and veggies hemp seeds require no advance soaking to derive optimal nutritional benefit here is a great way to enjoy hemp cup hemp seeds cup spring water tbsp maple syrup honey stevia or your favorite sweetneer dash himalyan salt optional flavoriing cinnamon nutmeg vanilla cardamom combine all in a blender and blend well until a creamy white milk forms pour through a strainer to remove any husk residue will keep in refrigerator for days but i recommend preparing small batches right when you want to drink them as fresh is the most tasty and most nutritious you could also make a great milk out of cinnamon red maca almond butter
positive,11/6/21,i love this gravy mix much easier and less fat than making from scratch and not as salty as mccormick s or other brands i use non fat milk instead of water to make a cream gravy this is good stuff and by time you order this set of and other items there is no shipping and no tax the price is much less than i could get when on sale at my local supermarket
positive,28/9/21,i love this stuff there isn t an instant coffee out there that s anywhere near this good this isn t even in the same category as any other instant it actually tastes like real coffee shocking but true it s no lie almost as good as freshly brewed starbucks it s also great for iced coffee and for adding to smoothies and other recipes that call for a coffee kick however the stuff is so darned expensive that i feel foolish buying it unfortunately it has to be a special splurge when my budget allows
positive,23/8/21,compared to what i pay at the normal grocery store for almonds these are priced great and taste fresh and crunchy the sea salt taste is perfect and the containers are conviently sized
positive,16/7/21,this is a must have in my home i use olive oil for everything my skin hair cooking taking off makeup this is great quality organic virgin olive oil and i m in heaven
positive,2/8/21,i made prunes a permanent part of my diet because a they are promoted as the best food source of antioxidants and b because they re very sweet and serve as a good sugar substitute for when you have sugar cravings they re also supposed to be good um um against constipation so be careful i usually eat a couple at a time and never more than four never a problem within these limits they re nice to add to oatmeal too along with bananas and raisins or instead of raisins raisins are also a good antioxidant in fact second best after prunes about half as strong i ve tried many kinds of prunes and so far sunsweet are the best i like their taste best consistency is good neither too mushy nor dried up like cardboard they keep up well i do keep thim in the fridge but that s strictlyl speaking unnecessary they ll be fine for a couple of weeks in the open and they taste better at room temperature and the product quality is consistent no surprises i buy them in stores where an oz canister usually costs between four and five bucks this page wants thirty well this must be some sort of error i expect an online price to be better not six to seven times what i can get locally so my bottomline is this sort of prunes is very good but pick them up at your local grocery store not here in fact i got them a few times on sale for like two seventy a piece in a local drugstore believe it or not be very careful with prices here first they jump around quite a bit and second if you subscribe and the price goes up they ll just go ahead and charge you more w o bothering to ask you if you agree to pay more avoid subscriptions because yeah they ll give you an extra discount and next month will jack up the price by it s a racket so stay clear ps just discovered trader joe s carries pitted prunes too a resealable plastic bag holds one pound oz and costs two eighty nine that s about one tenth of what this guy above wants bemuzing to say the least
positive,11/6/21,i ll certainly be a repeat customer i had a tough time finding large salt crystals to refill a grinder but this fit the bill nicely flavor is clean with slight minerality the color is not a deep as some other himalayan pink i ve seen but it s a very good finishing salt and a good conversation piece when put on the table in a clear grinder also the seller included a coupon for a future purchase in the package which was a nice bonus
positive,26/6/21,i got this at a great price i paid without subscribe and save for boxes that contain separate oz bags so you see is a whole bunch of cookies i m abroad but i hear that my stepson s reaction was wow they ll all be gone tomorrow teenager resembles a bottomless pit but it was a very good price cookies are fresh and packaging as appropriate will buy again by the way i just saw that the price on this was my favorite things llc refresh a couple of times till you see fulfilled by amazon com
positive,25/8/21,this product is well worth the money others carry a similar product that s cheaper but the quality is way cheaper also
positive,19/10/21,i bought this one until i saw one exactly like it at a big box store think red bullseye for this is going back

positive,22/10/21,my jack russell has problems with patella luxation i decided against surgery after researching the success rate of it and years after it was diagnosed she is still ok i keep her weight down and give her plenty of long walks to stengthen her ligaments the vet told me she would probably have problems with arthritis so i give her one of these chicken strips daily and also give her liquid glucosamine choindroitin on a small piece of bread my dog loves the chicken strips the price on amazon is better than me buying the indivdual packs from the store and having the glucosamine in it is another way for me to administer glucosamine to her in a way that is tasty
positive,6/8/21,i bought this for cooking from whipping egg whites to making my own baking powder this cream of tartar is great i put some in a small jar in my cupboard for everyday use the remainder i keep sealed tightly in the freezer it will last quite a long time and buying it this way is exponentially less expensive than buying the small over priced jars in the grocery market
positive,24/6/21,i got the same product at my local grocery store for much cheaper what s going on amazon you aren t even offering a bulk price great product my dogs love them too but can be found much cheaper elsewhere
positive,17/4/21,i purchased the same bag from the vet for when my dog was diagnosed with addison s disease i concludeded that i would need to use the pill pockets for the rest of his life not only do they work he wouldn t take the prednisone in cheese or other foods but you do not need to use the entire pill each time i just break away enough so that it covers his pill and he loves it great product at a great price
positive,10/3/21,the price for these k cups is great they are so costly in the store so this is a great way to buy in bulk
positive,21/1/21,product is good and came in a timely matter the price was way higher than at the asian store i found it for a rd of the price so i can buy lb bags at the store compared to this price for the same amount
positive,30/1/21,very reasonable price for an outstanding product checked many other retailers locally and online i can honestly say without a doubt that i received the best value for the pack coconut bars
positive,13/2/21,this is the best price i ve found for pb and it s eligible for free shipping and handling it tastes better than another powdered peanut butter product that i ve tried

positive,6/3/21,i ordered bags of this item and paid per bag when i received it i saw it came from trader joes so the next time i needed some i went to our local trader joes and paid per bag unbelievable

positive,14/1/21,my two dogs adore greenies this seemed to be the best place price i found online very quickly shipped too
positive,24/5/21,i like to buy greenies for my dog but they are very expensive even in multi packs if you purchase at online pet stores they are somewhat less expensive but not like the boxes offered on amazon dogs need clean teeth and healthy gums and greenies will take care of both easily digestible for my year old shi tzu
positive,14/10/21,buying the greenies online is the way to go they cost about cheaper than if you were to walk into a chain pet store
positive,7/2/21,i found this site to have the best price for the quantities on the web i would definitely order from here again
positive,29/3/21,i buy these locally and they are more expensive than amazon com my dog likes them and we do see a difference in her teeth thanks

positive,10/3/21,so glad to find this product at a sensible price a bit less flavor being light but still a good taste and so much better for you than many alternatives
positive,10/7/21,oh my gosh i had been buying oz bottles for at the local grocery store when i discovered the excellent price at amazon even if you give one away it s a better deal than that i use agave in my fruit smoothies and this brand is excellent a light taste that adds the perfect sweetness
positive,1/6/21,my son loves the gerber breakfast buddies so i purchased an pack of each flavor i love them because they are very convenient and still nutritious however local stores sell these for less than amazon
positive,14/8/21,amazon has a hell of a nerve charging for a case of happy bellies cereal when anywhere else it is each can
positive,22/4/21,i got this at sams for cheaper shipped but hopefully they adjust the price on here soon because i prefer using amazon to order my goodies
positive,25/4/21,since there is a national shortage of canned pumpkin i was very happy to find an online source for this product our dog needs the pumpkin to keep her digestive tract regular and she loves it this is a great product at a great price
positive,1/4/21,i love to make pumpkin muffins and bread i first ordered this product over a year ago when pumpkin was hard to find in the store although i like to use natural organic products pumpkin is not necessarily one of those things that you need to have organic due to the thick rind however the price of this is impossible to pass up with s s the per can price is cheaper than the local store generic i didn t think there was much of a difference in taste until recently i made my muffins with another name brand pumpkin my muffins were just ok certainly not as yummy as usual the pumpkin was the only difference so here i am ordering more unless the price shoots up dramatically i won t use anything else i didn t realize the dented can thing was a widespread issue if i remember correctly i do think some of my cans in my first order were dented but not badly enough to make them unusable obviously we ve eaten them all with delicious results and no ill effects lol update this latest order arrived in perfect shape in a well reinforced box no dents or dings anywhere
positive,1/3/21,this is a great price for grade b maple i bought it for the lemonade diet and found it to be good to the last drop

positive,20/4/21,these syrup pumps are sometimes hard to find and when i have found them the price is ridiculously high i am pleased to have found these at a reasonable price
positive,20/4/21,i was a little apprehensive purchasing this entire lb can for consumption by only people however now that we ve eaten about half the can in a week i can say that my concern was not valid i love castelvetrano olives and this brand is fantastic my plan was to follow the recommendation of another reviewer and put the olives in a glass jar with water to reduce the brine but at the rate we are devouring them i don t believe that will be necessary my only regret is that i didn t purchase more at the same time i ll stock up on my next purchase
positive,21/4/21,i bought this same brand at a local health food store for oz it cost so when i bought this at oz it made economic sense
positive,2/5/21,cats if you are owned by a cat you know how fussy they can be my adopted feral cat just loves these treats i love spoiling her but they are so expensive at the grocery store now thansk to amazon com i can buy them in multiples the price is cheaper and what can i say about the convenience of having them shipped to the door
positive,19/1/20,this coffee tastes great best value for kerig system one thing you must do with this coffee after unpacking is put it in a plastic bag to keep fresh you must keep the air out do not put it in the frige keep it room temp if you are a coffee expert like me you will love this coffee rich flavor all flavors are great even the decaf you will save around cents to cents per pod leave it to amazon to bring us this great coffee i am a prime member i save on shipping and handiling become a prime member and save way to go amazon

positive,27/2/20,this tea is overpriced at asian markets retail is certainly wholesale is drastically less the price asked for here is appalling it s the exact same tea and foojoy is considered one of the lesser brands in teas the product is great the seller doubtful
positive,26/2/21,great product but i pay cents per pouch at our local grocery store here they are selling for over dollars a pouch i was hoping to put a few cases on monthly shipment but given the price i will keep buying them at the grocery store
positive,18/12/19,we need to buy these for one of our children who has special needs and the price on amazon can t be beat
positive,19/1/20,i ve been eating carnation instant breakfast for a few years now and this is about as a good a price as i ve found i ve found it cheaper when on sale at a local store but those sales are rare i use two cups of milk instead of the instructed one so the flavor is diluted a bit but still good
positive,10/7/20,this product is great for people on who eat plant based whole foods there is no sugar added the product tastes delicious the price however is quite expensive for the size of the jar i found a similar product at a local whole foods grocery store for half the price
positive,14/4/21,i m not generally a huge fan of keurig coffee makers because they and their k cups are so expensive but my girlfriend has one and she ran out of coffee for it i looked around amazon and found this item it sounded promising so i decided to try it it is the best k cup of coffee i ve ever had it has a strong mellow medium roast flavor and it s also the least expensive i ve found i signed up for a subscription and will probably keep it going yum
positive,24/4/21,iam a shopper for quality for less this coffee is a excellant value as it has a great coffee taste i hope this company comes out with some flavored coffees for my afternoon treat
positive,28/4/21,like many of the other reviewers i ve tried all of the premium dog foods out there when our family hit some tough financial times i began looking for a good food that would be a better fit with our budget this food absolutely fits the bill my golden retriever mix is not crazy about it but that doesn t bother me that much he s a good weight and he will eat it when he s hungry he s had some allergy issues in the past and i was sure this food would kick them into gear but it didn t after fully transitioning to this food he has not gotten itchy at all i m definitely going to stick with chicken soup why pay twice as much on dog food if you don t have to
positive,12/7/21,i was buying these at the pet store for each with this deal you get two for that price i ordered the largest size possible because i know my corgis like to chew the heck out of these they love these i ve discovered they prefer the flat ones to the rounded type one that was sent in this deal was just a little curved which makes it harder for their stumpy legs to hold while chewing so they argue over who gets the un bent one if i hold the crooked one then they will chew it but they definitely like the flatter one best a very good value if your dogs are chewers
positive,18/12/19,much cheaper than buying it in stores and my dog loved it he would spend maybe mins on the granola outer layer and then unwrap the rawhide to eat the middle my dog doesn t eat rawhide really and always did this with dingo bones too will keep my dog busy for mins or so and he seems to enjoy it so i will probably get this again
positive,19/1/20,this is a good price and my very picky son eats this tt was delivered on time and i used the amazon subscription to get the price a little lower
positive,8/8/20,what can i say it s ground flax seed the five stars are for the price i used to buy the stuff at walmart who sold it in their baking goods section in a box at a very reasonable price the last time i looked for it the sales lady says oh we moved it to pharmacy section they sure did move it along with repackaging and bumping the price about times as much amazon has a great price but the only drawback is that a pack of oz jars is a lot of flax seed
positive,22/5/21,my daughter loves the food and i like it even better because it s organic and amazon has the best price

positive,13/7/21,my cat is used to eating weruva and tiki cat so i wasn t sure how he would take to this brand this doesn t look at all like the previous two brands which actually look like people food whereas bff brand looks like typical cat food lou isn t normally picky but he doesn t eat this food quite as quickly as tiki or weruva i bought two cases of tuna bonito and tuna shrimp and while it s a good price i think next time we ll stick to weruva for big cans of food and tiki for small cans he gets one big can in the am and one small can in the pm i d buy this stuff again in the future if i was in a pinch as it s not a bad food i just like my cats food to look more like real fish or chicken vs over processed stuff but good ingredients and grain free at a good price
positive,9/7/21,uhhh you can get one of these ounce jars at the grocery store for wtf the sauce is indeed the best but bucks really
positive,15/7/21,these do taste better than the cheap brands like maruchuan and you get a slightly larger oz block but these are way more expensive i ve seen them in local wal marts for a slightly lower price overall they do have a good flavor not too salty or mushy

positive,26/7/21,ok the package says that these are ese pods they look the same as other ese pods have the same shape and size as other ese pods that i have around and weigh the same as other ese pods as far as i can tell these pods even brew for about as long other ese pods using my saeco espresso classico machine i don t know whether it s the grind that lavazza uses but the lavazza pods don t seem to be as tightly packed as other ese pods and the resulting espresso is slightly less strong than the espresso made by the other ese pods that being said the espresso is perfectly acceptable particularly when you take into account the price that you pay when you go on amazon s subscription plan
positive,11/9/21,i ordered this when i found a few indian recipes that i wanted to try it would have been outrageous for me to buy all the spices individually but thankfully i found this all the spices come in separate baggies my only complaint is that when they arrived they were all jumbled up but there is a list that tells you where each one goes in the box and it was simple to follow so it was no big deal
positive,11/9/21,i was having problems finding good reasonably priced beans out of season here they are
positive,15/9/21,i have tried a lot of hazelnut coffees and this is my favorite the k cups perform well unlike another brand whose name i won t mention wp and the flavor is much bolder than every other brand green mountain used to have a bold one but it was discontinued except in sample packs with other flavors this coffee has a nice taste too i just wish i could find it locally and for less money you used to be able to get a bundle of large boxes from amazon but they re not currently available i think this was the best price i could get but was disappointed when i received my tiny boxes if you overlooked it these boxes only contain k cups each i ll keep looking for better value but in the meantime i can still enjoy a good cup of coffee made at home i gave it only four stars because of the price but i do recommend this coffee

positive,10/7/21,i used to use the other popular brand that cost times more this brand is better at the price this product has a very rich pink color from what i have read the source of the pink color is where the health benefits of himalayan salt come from the deep pink color of this salt would indicate a very healthy product and its tasty too

positive,1/3/20,this is a great value on a great product i use this daily on my skin as a moisturizer and for cooking can t beat the quality or the price
positive,3/8/19,i have gotten this product in smaller jars before and was very pleased so to save money i ordered the gallon tub the coconut oil in the tub seems to have less flavor than the jars or maybe it was that particular batch i ll know better after i try the next gallon tub i will order this product again may i am half way thru my second gallon of this product and the taste is very good my only wish now is that it was cold pressed unheated

positive,28/7/20,my mom drinks a cup or two of tea everyday and makes iced tea so we go through these pretty fast amazon has a great price
positive,14/9/21,this coffee looks like its a collection of beans which has been swept up off the floor afer a days roasting which is not meant as a criticism that is what i would expect poor mans blend to be but seriously its very consistently decent coffee you can t beat it for the subscription price i think i am on my rd bag s and am hooked there are certainly better coffees but not for the poor man me

positive,14/7/21,i have very long thick hair and have been coloring it for years so no matter how often i get my hair trimmed most of it is dry and fairly fragile although the aroma of this product is a little lighter than the others products of this line that i have tried it is still a little over powering for my taste my hair scent clashes with my perfume i hate that and that is why i try always to purchase fragrance free products but that issue aside this product seems to do what it claims to do i m always looking for an inexpensive product that may be the equivalent of a salon product well i m sorry there just aren t any but this conditioner comes slightly closer than most i did seem to see less hair in my comb as i was combing my hair out after my shower my scalp seems to bee less dry and my comb ran through my hair quite easily after drying and using the heated flate iron on my hair it appeared silky somewhat shiny and was quite easy to manage
positive,18/7/19,i get these all the time and this seller has a good price best on the web so far and just the rite size too not too big and there hard all the way through iv had some the crumbled about through
positive,1/3/20,i have a delicious recipe for pumpkin muffins that i make again and again and i am tired of spending too much money on the little supermarket jars of pumpkin pie spice the quality and taste of this product is just as good for a fraction of the cost

positive,9/5/20,i love this soup very hard to find in florida thank you amazon for stocking it
positive,1/3/20,my son age has food allergies wheat soy dairy peanut so he knows when he sees enjoy life on the package he can actually have it and it s great for him to have options w different flavor cookies it makes it easier for me when i have to pack his lunch for school to give him something different each day the only thing i would love to have on the subscribe and save program is the ability to mix and match products but the product itself is great my son says they have a little bit of a bite to them but that is how ginger cookies are he compares these to the pamela s ginger snaps he likes both but sometimes he likes to have the soft ginger cookies which is the enjoy life type
positive,28/7/20,the title says it all this is a great oil and the price is right my shipment came promptly avocado oil is great for cooking and has many health benefits
positive,7/3/20,i was very happy with this product coconut oil in mac and cheese gives it a little hint of tropical taste without overwhelming the dish i ordered this in february the cooler part of the year and it arrived in perfect condition some others have written that they were not happy because it apparently leaked all over the place this is probably due to the product becoming liquid at degrees my oil was solid when it arrived and did not have this problem i hope amazon can resolve this issue quickly
positive,4/8/20,i am new to coconut oil the cost is what kept me from trying it sooner this is the best deal i ve ever run across and the product is excellent
positive,26/12/19,i buy all of my pets food on amazon the prices are great and with the free shipping over it s a win win deal
positive,28/3/21,i was at wal mart today and compared pricing a box for oz it was around at wal mart for oz in their store brand so the real deal is slightly cheaper and shows right up at the door can t beat it i wish the prices were as good on other cereal on amazon as a bonus these boxes came with a spider man movie ticket promotion so i ordered more to get free tickets for my family via the promotion consider that the cereal was almost free

positive,9/3/18,uncle purchase k cup keurig brewer for my office my staff and i love it no arguments about who is going to clean up the coffee at the end of the day who is to blame for not turning it off and coffee burning at the bottom of the jug plus we can have a selection of different coffees to suite the tastes for anyone we love it the gloria jean s hazelnut is a very flavorful but not a strong coffee i prefer the jet fuel brand but for the tamer coffee drinkers in the office they swear by it
positive,20/2/18,great product and the pricing on amazon is pretty much impossible to beat you get about bottles on amazon for the price of one at most places i use this syrup mostly for lattes
positive,22/3/18,these are the only rose hips i ve had in my life so i don t have any standard of comparison tastes good to me though i became interested in these because of joint gum problems and hearing that vitamin c could help with that i figured that bioflavonoids other compounds may be important for absorbing vitamin c and i d probably be better off getting it from a whole food than from a supplement not that there s anything wrong with supplements just my way of thinking anyway i mostly use these for making soaked tea or just iced tea d basically i just put a good amount of these in a bottle filled with a couple cups of water around tablespoons shake it up stick that in the refrigerator then shake it up really well the next day when the rose hips are softened that s when the water takes on a rich orange light amber color and noticeably thickens up maybe from the pectin that i m assuming is in the rose hips and also tastes great shaking it really well helps to disperse all the flavor keep that in mind i eat the rose hips too after soaking overnight and they taste good as well but a little strong eating a lot of them i ve made tea with them and i enjoy that a lot but i thought that heating it up so much would destroy a lot of the vitamin c if you re drinking it for enjoyment it doesn t really matter what you do and the rose hip tea i made with these rose hips tasted great you have to use a good amount of rose hips to get that tangy sour flavor for making cup i d at least use a couple tablespoons but that s just me everyone has their preferences overall i think it s very pleasant and refreshing though i prefer it unheated and just soaked and shaken i make kefir and adding these to the ripening under airlock phase can make an interesting brew there s a lot you can do with these things so don t be afraid to get creative as for this specific brand as i said it s the only one i ve tried so i don t have a standard of comparison but i m satisfied with these think they taste fine and they were sold for a great price no complaints here
positive,12/3/18,i am so happy i finally found these on here to the person who gave a star because they are you may be able to go in a store and pay a box if your like the rest of us who are from ny nj etc and moved to the west coast you cannot find these anywhere i usually stock up on these when i go back to ny but its nice to know i can order them whenever i want

positive,7/12/17,it s so hard to find no sodium seasonings other than mrs dash this is a great product at a great price
positive,24/5/19,i was a little surprised by the problems experienced by soulwriterchick per her review four adult cats in our house two with sensitive gut or skin have been eating this stuff for two months they like it after several tentative days as well as the similar quality but too expensive halo spot s stew natural dry cat food their preference for this food is the same as their preference for the much cheaper by the lb bag iams adult active maturity natural balance has better ingredients though comparing these products with science diet they like the new science diet age defying senior dry cat food best by flavor costs almost as much as halo but the science diet foods have ingredients no better in quality than the far cheaper iams and the cats all of them eat far too much of the science diet or act like they re starving making it the least economical of the bunch it s clear the scientists at science diet have developed some kind of kittie cocaine grrr update after another month of use i find the gang after getting used to the non standard taste have migrated to this dry food and have not been eating as much of the iams or a sensitive cat purina product they also like the halo product a lot now month update a recent emotional blow for the cats losing their older brother seems to have made them very fussy about food i had also made the mistake of giving them some canned food a few months back a big mistake anyhow at present they are refusing to eat this natural balance dry food it is good stuff i just have to figure out how to get them back on track
positive,9/3/18,it came pretty quick was at an unbeatable price and was the same good hot cereal i get from the store no damage or anything not much else to say
positive,18/5/18,i have been a loyal coffee bean direct customer for a couple years now we mostly prefer the dark sumatra but have tried a few others as well we find the dark sumatra to be the boldest while very low in acid this means you can make it as strong as you like without the upset stomach highly recommend both the dark sumatra and the seller

positive,29/7/19,this is my favorite tea for the keurig i love it and this was the best price i could find
positive,17/5/20,for just about this canister gives you about cups of coffee that is just over a nickel a cup you can t beat that that means that for the same money as premium coffees like starbucks or seattle s best you can get cups assuming a cup if you took a day for days a week for a year you would be spending just on coffee alone money you can save for a car or down payment even if the starbucks tastes a little better is it really worth it this coffee does not taste as good as premium but it does not taste bad either so coffee afficionados would not be as let down as they think and honestly that starbucks via stuff is way too expensive at a cup granted instant is not as good as a really fresh cup of freshly ground coffee but it tastes better than most coffee because most coffee is not freshly ground especially the pre ground coffee in bricks or cans because freeze dried retains freshness a longer time if it is kept air sealed you get a fresh cup almost every time there are only two big downsides to the ounce containers first by the time you get to the bottom of the canister you might experience some staleness this is because of exposure to air which affects even freeze dried coffee one possible solution is to seal small batches and keep them away from light and heat it is easy to add too much instant coffee to a cup it only takes a teaspoon to a teaspoon and a half for one cup nothing more it only takes a little to make a cup overall nescafe taster s choice offers a great balance between cost savings and taste is it as good as fresh brewed perhaps not especially if you can get freshly ground coffee that you make yourself but it is certainly better than most coffee you get at say a diner or restaurant cafes make it better but at a cup they are not worth it unless just as an occasional indulgence if you are one of those people who has always scoffed at instant i d say at least give this a try
positive,26/3/20,we recently switched to formula and i have been looking all over for the cheapest price on our preferred formula this was the cheapest price that i found anywhere including the manufacturer and local big box stores my package came in the advertised packaging unlike some other reviews i was very happy with the price the product and the value
positive,3/5/19,this is the best priced coconut flour i could find my recipes don t call for a whole lot of it at a time so i hope it stays fresh for a while i did have a problem with the recloseable zip lock bag it doesn t work so i have to roll it down and close it with a closepin i hope the other bags are better

positive,13/1/20,i have purchased these a couple times for my two dogs great price even with the expensive shipping charge and long lasting there is nothing worse than paying for a dog chew and then watching your dog eat it in less than minutes
positive,21/9/20,using keurig cups is so great but also expensive it is a luxury i will have to give up after retirement but the ease of trying so many different coffees is really great and i have enjoyed the coffee and the makers immensely

positive,20/11/19,i purchased this via amazon because i am never sure i will be able to find it locally and not have it cost an arm a leg and firstborn male child you cannot beat the price and the knowledge i will not have to comb the grocery stores looking made it a win win not only that but each container i received had a cent coupon attached so if i do find it locally i can enjoy a great discount
positive,28/6/20,i haven t recieved the noodles yet but i m very impressed with the price with my sights set on making a soba dish i headed to the grocery store to find that an eight ounce package of soba noodles was selling for and my recipe called for twelve ounces i just could not see paying for a simple noodle dish as an experiment i bought one package of soba noodles and one package of udon to see if the soba noodles were really necessary the soba noodles were significantly better for this dish so i was resigned to have to pay so much for my yummy dish then i came here to and found that i can get a larger package of noodles for a little over per package after shipping i was very pleased i hope they taste good i ll be back for more as i think i m becoming addicted to soba noodles

positive,20/10/21,i prefer pu erhs that are earthy slightly smoky and finish smoothly while this tea doesn t completely fit this profile it will do it isn t as good as some pricier pu erhs but it s as good an everyday tea as i have found other tea lovers in my family have adopted it as their regular morning tea even though they are not the pu erh aficionados that i am
positive,21/7/20,i love goya tomato sauce and its not sold in my town amazon had it cheaper than i normally pay plus the added bonus of not having to drive minutes and pay taxes on it the only downside would be the mail carrier more than half the cans arrived dented amazon was nice enough to refund some of the cost
positive,22/2/21,a lot cheaper than the store and the bulk will make it last a little longer than usual always great flavor and constancy with this product
positive,2/12/20,i tried this product because i have relatives who are diabetic and i m always looking for low carb alternatives the muffins have a somewhat cornbread kind of taste and were a little dull in taste i added a few frozen blueberries and this helped a lot my only complaint is that these mixes are quite expensive and i may not be able to order as many as i would like they will have to be a treat rather than a staple too bad
positive,20/11/19,with the economy so tight i feel fortunate to have found the cat food my cats like for a price i can afford thanks
positive,25/1/21,this was a great price as opposed to the wal mart price for the same brand my kids love to eat these as an after school snack and this price allows me to provide them with this olivia

positive,26/7/21,this price does not even begin to be competitive with my local grocery stores let alone sam s club or walmart

positive,31/7/20,i really like the cappucino flavor of this soy milk and drink it daily at breakfast i ve given it a star rating but find that it is much too pricey from amazon i will continue to purchase it at my local market for less than a carton
positive,13/6/20,i think this is new on the market and got a free sample it tastes delicious like pina colada but not too sweet heavy low cal and uses sucralose aka splenda which is closer to natural sugar and supposedly better for you then aspartame nutrasweet would be even better with stevia but at a pop that s to get your vitamin d each month still if you are into fufu nutritional drinks and you got the money to spend this is one of the better ones i ve run across if i could get it for under a pop i could get hooked on it these guys are obviously competing with the likes of vitamin water which comes in oz bottles instead of and can be had for cheaper interesting bottle shape though they ll have to probably drop the price or say bye bye at least in this economy
positive,31/7/20,our dogs really go crazy for these they are really good for their teeth and they seem to be able to digest them easily they are small dogs so i let them have them for about or minutes and then i take them away bully sticks are really expensive at the pet store i saw two for about bucks too much these are a great deal

positive,5/12/20,i lived in italy and grew very accustomed to great coffee lavblu is as good as any i ve had it costs a bit more in stores so if you order more than three cans or so it s probably saving you money if you order six or so as i do even with the shipping it s a bargain buy the rosa if you re making on the stove as this is too fine for a stove with a machine it s just outstanding new lines sales is easy to deal with quick and responsive

positive,6/6/21,we have enjoyed eight o clock coffee for several years i keep an eye on the price at the local grocery stores and try to stock up when it goes on sale which is not often amazon has been putting the whole beans on sale rather regularly and the price is far better than the grocery store the beans store well in the freezer it s delivered right to your door so what s not to love about that

positive,30/1/21,we found this pearl sugar after looking at a recipe in a king arthur flour catalog it seems to be quite a bit cheaper then what you would pay at most specialty shops my wife uses it with swedish braided bread good stuff
positive,1/1/21,i have to admit as far as this little luxury of maple syrup goes it s all about price kirkland products tend to be of good quality and fair pricing though so always a good place to start since maple syrup is a single ingredient food and not something i eat every day i really don t find all that much variation in taste from one brand to the next this kirkland syrup tastes just as good as about any other with important consideration for comparisons being fair i e of the same color grade i did not find this to be thinner than other brands either great on pancakes waffles crepes aebleskiver i ve also recently started experimenting with using maple syrup instead of sugar in for certain recipes as it is a more pure less processed form of sweetening pleased with this product and recommended
positive,11/1/21,bought this to put in party favor bags price was great item arrived quickly and fruit snacks tasted great would definitely order again
positive,31/7/20,i like buying these in bulk as it they are easier to store in the box good product usually beats the price at my local stores

positive,18/6/21,this is a large amount of crystalized ginger and i don t think you could beat the price i would have preferred it to be a bit more sweet to offset the heat of the ginger but it s still good
positive,18/6/21,these pumpkin seeds were exactly the same as the ones they sell at markets for nearly for half the price
positive,7/7/21,this coffee has become my morning ritual because in my opinion it is the best coffee pod for the price out there though i haven t tried the other melitta roasts those are next on my list it is so dark and rich with a chocolate taste and a great body reminds me of a good americano blows a starbucks americano out of the water i ve found the best method to getting the best out of this pod is to brew it using about ounces of water with my bunn mc pod brewer on the tea setting this makes a very strong brew so i add about or ounces of hot water to round it out my only complaint about these pods is the consistency it seems like i get a bad bitter tasting pod here and there there is also kind of a dry aftertaste but in all honesty it could be something i m not doing right in the brewing process i m only taking off one star since i don t know what the issue is otherwise i m very very pleased with this coffee i ve not felt the need to go to a coffee shop since i purchased it i will definitely be buying again
positive,18/6/21,when i order the beans i had opened the lid and the seal was already broken like it had been pushed in and i didn t want to eat them nor give them to my husband so i had contacted the seller through amazon and they said throw them away and we will send you a new batch and they did just that no hassle and no problem and they shipped pretty fast these beans very very good compared to some we are coffee lovers and dark chocolate lovers so we had to try this pair and glad we did oh did i mention it has a real coffee bean lol some that we have tried was like ground coffee bean bits not the whole bean so over all good price quality and the amount and it is yummy
positive,7/7/21,i ve always been a little anxious to purchase groceries online but i gave it a shot with this product and i m satisfied great price and awesome product if you re worried about purchasing it just try it you won t regret it
positive,1/7/21,the caraway seeds are a really good value i did encounter a problem with the time it took for the order to arrive i bake for a farmers market and was depending on receiving the seeds on the date that i was given apparently there was a problem with the bags and had they just let me know i would have not kept expecting them i finally contacted amazon concerning my order and was then advised of the delay i would order these caraway seeds again as they are fresh and well packed to stay that way i hope i never have to resort to buying them in the grocery store again

positive,18/6/21,so much less expensive than other brands not very informative packaging though and who knows if it s organic or what a little clumpy but hey as far as having no sugar staples in the house you can t beat the price
positive,7/7/21,i have tried different kinds of oolongs and found this tea to have a very rich woodsy taste it brews a dark red brown color in comparison to some other lighter oolongs which brew golden although it tastes quite strong which i like it lacks the sweet aromatic flavors that i love in a previous oolong i ve tasted those tend to be much more expensive so i settled for this one it tastes pretty good seems good quality for the price i m pretty much addicted to oolong tea so i needed something that i could buy at a good price still enjoy
positive,18/6/21,i had tried several stevia products in the past and always threw them out because they were awful this one is pretty good i admit it s not the best tasting sweetener but i suppose it s the healthiest alternative so far as we know anyways thus it s the one i use i use to use equal many years ago but it gave me a headache and i found out it was a neurotoxin then i started using splenda which is the best in my opinion as far as taste goes but now you hear about it not being that great either healthwise being chlorinated and all so i stopped using it then i tried truvia like i said it s not the best it does leave a bit of an aftertaste with tea and using it for whipped cream did not work at all i ended up having to add a bunch of powdered sugar to the cream to make it edible i primarily use it to sweeten my greek yogurt with berries as i still need a touch of sweetness so one packet is great tastes good i also use it for my other low carb dessert oz cream cheese with a few berries and one packet of truvia also good
positive,7/7/21,i ordered three of these thru amazon prime no longer available as of my last order was oct th and price was and now the price from outside vendor is around plus shipping that is over double the amazon price from last month i rate this product stars for being natural but one star for current price gouging it blends well and has a nice flavor i won t order again until amazon sells it

positive,13/9/21,this is one of the best espresso coffee brands in the price range definitely recommend over cafe bustelo i order the pack every few weeks
positive,18/6/21,this ends up being about half the price that i would pay at any store and it tastes exactly the same as the packets do not be fooled by people saying its cheaper at walmart because they are referring to the oz sizes walmart does not even carry these oz sizes not even online i bought of these containers and i recommend you do the same

positive,15/1/21,the price is great and the teas are individually wrapped which is a plus since the exterior box of mine was torn and tapped in places haven t tired them yet but the box says not to use them in more than cups of water
positive,6/3/21,i started buying this brand of food when my dog had a litter of puppies i bought the puppy lover s bag i loved that it has wholesome ingredients and that meat is the first ingredient on the list look through the bags of dog foods at your grocer and you ll see that meat isn t first or second and then when you find it you ll find it only contains meat by products my pets have had a healthy coat firm stools eating this brand of dog food and you can t beat the price the added chelated minerals and natural preservatives create a holistic pet food i will continue to feed this to my dogs and recommend it to my friends as well

positive,14/10/21,we have this on automatic order with amazon to take advantage of the improved pricing we go through about ounce box per day and buying from amazon saves us a ton of money prime members so no shipping cost every once in a while we get a box that was beat up a little bit but not that big of a deal for the amount of money we save buying this stuff in bulk i am certain that should i ever feel like complaining to amazon about the shipping issue they would send me a replacement pronto that being said it s really no big deal

positive,27/1/21,not the best canned mushrooms on earth but the price is good and they are definitely ok for tossing in a pot of spaghetti sauce or using as an extra ingredient in a soup or stir fry when there are no fresh mushrooms in the house just make sure that you rinse them thoroughly first as they have a slightly canned taste if they aren t washed
positive,1/6/21,local markets don t carry wild rice or charge about for ounces after searching the net this was the best deal i could find and it is a good high quality rice that cooks up great enjoy
positive,21/4/21,it s splenda and at a good price forget about the individual packets the cost will kill you if you use the product this is the way to buy it

positive,20/4/21,i like the product and bought because i was not able to find it here locally though i had previosly purchased it at costco charleston sc i should have looked more closely at the price because i was shocked i paid almost for three oz jars my fault but i will not be ordering any more on line
positive,21/4/21,my dad loves this product the local stores sell one small box for an excess of for one oz box he eats this desert everyday now that we have enough it tastes just as good as the store bought product for a fraction of the cost great product
positive,2/5/21,i switched to felidae canned cat food to help control the weight of my cats my vet says some cats don t metabolize the carbs of dry food well i started with science diet but that quickly broke the bank after months i m happy to report my cats have lost weight eating this cat food my dog gets canidae same brand as felidae all life stages dry kibble which i also recommend

positive,7/9/21,this was such a great price on this cereal i was paying every day from our cafeteria for these
positive,25/5/21,this item is way over priced check your local walmart and find it way cheaper the juice is great tasting with kids
positive,22/5/21,pumpkin seeds are hard to find in the stores without an outrageous price this is a great deal
positive,19/7/21,i was a bit skeptical at getting another brand than green mountain brands since grove square and san fran bay were really bad besides the original problem they had with the production on their first boxes brooklyn beans have been a great new find for us i could go through each blend but they are all similar to other gmcr brands the k cups seem a little lighter in weight and the lighter roasts did seem watery for the travel cup size but that is about the norm with all k cups the best thing i really like is the company actually responds and fixes any problems so stop complaining about the shipping when you are leaving feedback on the product i always get my shipments at least days ahead of scheduled date so don t be afraid to try these and save money subscribe and save another
positive,7/9/21,love this coffee no problems brewing cannot beat the price realy good coffee and afordable customer service was top notch we raise our coffee cup to you
positive,25/5/21,my dog is older and on several pills a day she just loves these pill pockets she swallows them whole and does not know that there is a pill hidden inside i loved buying them in bulk and geting a great price
positive,7/9/21,i have two small dogs that both require medicating times a day this product is a life saver they stand at the counter and bark to remind me when it is time for their medicine the pill pockets are pricey but at amazon you can save a bundle compared to buying them at the vet s office if you opt for standard shipping plan on a good week s time for your order to arrive
positive,13/10/21,thank you amazon for carrying amy s at such a reasonable price i paid about for this case when they were trying to charge me for it at my health food store these are the best refried beans i ve ever had they taste even better since i add about a half a jar of salsa mild great value brand from walmart per can i love them because they don t taste like oil and they don t make me feel sick afterwards as other refried bean brands sometimes do i definitely recommend
positive,2/10/21,i now will never run out of food for my cats they both love it every time and i love the price
positive,23/9/21,this is an excellent product but unfortunately its not eligible for super saver shipping so the cost is too much per tart

positive,25/5/21,i have purchased these crackers in the supermarket for twice the price these were very fresh and arrived in days very good buy
positive,15/7/21,we eat a box a week of these crackers so ordering in bulk from amazon helps us cut costs and they deliver it to us monthly through subscribe and save
positive,3/6/21,if you can get past the fact that this does not arrive in any form of a package with the picture that is shown your good if you are looking for a great assortment of flavors that would be impossible to get all on your own then this is for you too i was very pleased with the assortment and how fun to go through and pick your flavor to try each time i purchased this for myself since my huband is more loyal to only one plain flavor k cup and i like variety
positive,27/9/21,needed mimi moo s in a hurry and you delivered thank you our customers appreciate it we appreciate the low price
positive,19/6/21,i like bob s red mill flours and the sorghum flour is great too the pack of is a great price at least where i live and it works well in creating the recipes from my gluten free cookbook
positive,3/8/21,i started using swiss miss diet a few months ago and love it for on y calories the price on amazon far exceeds any grocery store in my area
positive,5/9/21,for those who appreciate capers this is the only way to buy they are the sometimes difficult to find smaller buds and the price can t be beat plus they will last forever in your frig having a good supply at a good price will encourage some adventurous cooking
positive,25/5/21,my vet wanted this supplement for both my dogs this is the same supplement at a good discount from my vet s price will be back again and again

positive,22/7/21,we have been buying this coffee every month for six month it has a nice mellow earthy flavor with low acidity considering i worked at starbucks for a few years i would say this is on par to their dark latin american blend the beans are always fresh
positive,22/6/21,really enjoyed ordering and using this coffee reminds me of expresso in coffee shops throughout italy i ve never really used pre packed coffee before as i ve always preferred freshly ground however this taste fresh and yummy great head not bitter but still has good depth will continue to order every time i need more coffee
positive,28/7/21,i like giving my son some prunes once in a while to get him regular the price for this pack is outstanding it came neatly packed to prevent damage i love earth s best baby food
positive,13/10/21,i don t think you can beat the value of this coffee especially with the subscribe and save program it is also a great french roast with a full deep flavor it does not taste burnt like some of the starbucks varieties but is smooth and a little smokey i like strong coffee and so this is definitely the way to go for me i ve had compliments from visitors to our house on how good the coffee is as well i m completely satisfied
positive,19/2/21,i had read earlier that the colombian coffee by eight o clock was judged to be the best brand for flavor and taste i purchased the larger bags as they were a good buy for the price i feel like a winner twice and have a great cup of coffee each morning too
positive,14/12/20,there was a lot of food in a small package here which was a pleasant surprise honestly now as a disclaimer i should mention i ve eaten more than my bodyweight in mres so my standards for edible and delicious in long term storage food might be a bit low but i actually really dug this the salmon spread was zippy and spicy without being too much and just enough for the crackers the edamame are darker looking than you see in the boxart and do have a bit of a beany aftertaste i wish there was a bit less of those and way more of that fruit mix unlike regular dried fruit this had a nice gingery seasoning that made it really outstanding i could eat just that and be a happy little camper and the chocolate square is nummy d the downsides as others have mentioned is that for that price you can probably go get something fresh cooked to eat and there is a good bit of waste each individual plastic wrapper and the box itself the plus sides are that it is portable it s tasty and it s quite handy will i buy it again i think so honestly sometimes i don t have time the night before to pack up a healthy lunch from home and in that case this would be a great way to stave off the temptation of the dreaded vending machine or the temptation to call out for pizza not an every day item for me but as an occasional treat definitely
positive,19/2/21,i was super excited to find this online for a better price than my grocery store i ve never used spelt flour before but i made cookies with it and i liked them
positive,10/1/21,i was getting these for my pitbull mix from walmart for around it takes him about days to consume one and i haven t had problems with big pieces choking him like i do with other chews i only wish they were sold by the case
positive,24/2/21,if you love couscous but hate paying the price of the leading brand give this one a try i received my sampler set the other day and my family has been enjoying it ever since you can add your own flavoring chicken broth garlic or just salt and butter this is a very good value and perfect to stock up your pantry with
positive,14/12/20,my daughter teaches kindergarten and i help her and the other kindergarten kids do gingerbread houses at xmas every year we have to buy the small tubes since m m do does not sell the bags locally these bags are much cheaper and we will have left overs for other projects
