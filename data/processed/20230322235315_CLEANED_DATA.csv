positive,18/6/21,this is a very healthy dog food good for their digestion also good for small puppies my dog eats her required amount at every feeding 
positive,7/7/21,i have been very pleased with the natural balance dog food our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and i had someone recommend natural balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains since switching i have not had any issues it is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger smaller sized dogs 
positive,18/6/21,before i was educated about feline nutrition i allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food i always offered both canned and dry but wish i would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food i have two year old cats and two year old cats the only good quality dry foods they will eat are wellness and innova innova s manufacturer was recently purchased by procter gamble i began looking for a replacement after once again offering several samples from my local holistic pet store holistic select was the only one other than the usual wellness and innova they would eat for finicky cats i recommend trying holistic select it is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters 
positive,7/7/21,my holistic vet recommended this along with a few other brands we tried them all but my cats prefer this especially the sardine version the best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear and and i do not want to be rude so i will say this as delicately as i can their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the mcdonalds junk found in most stores which is a definite plus for me the health benefits are so obvious i highly recommend holistic select 
positive,1/7/21,i bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the ganocafe and has the organic reishi mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidants i did not expect it to taste good but it actually does i have only had it for a few days and for its totally worth it my sisters all take ganocafe but now i am introducing them to this less expensive similar coffee i will follow up on this product in a few weeks 
positive,7/7/21,like the other people mentioned this coffee has a great taste i have tried different instant coffees before but this one is one of the better ones another one of my favorites if you want to try it out though not organic is africafe pure instant coffee 
positive,23/7/21,a good tasting light chip that has some value in nutrition everyone get the munchies is this is a good alternative to eating potato chips 
positive,20/7/21,a grande item delicious fish with the ultimate flavor best ever in a can for all purposes i sent a case to my mother recently diagnosed with diabetes and she loves it as a main entree for cooking patties 
positive,19/7/21,i ordered this product two times now and have been very happy with both the delivery and the product it works great for cooking baking and as a substitute sugar in my chai lattes 
positive,18/6/21,this stuff is great because it is low glycemic substitute this to sugar and you will be doing your body a great favor this size is economical and shipping is fast too i got mine very soon 
positive,7/7/21,these chips are the only ones i found to be tasty and healthy they have fewer fat calories plus higher fiber for those who want good taste and nutrition the perfect blend 
positive,27/6/21,i used to buy these at the local supermarket but they are no longer carried there finding them on amazon i purchased a box and found they were fresh and delicious as i remembered for chips they are also very healthy i definately will buy them again 
positive,21/7/21,i have been feeding liver biscotti for years i was looking for a healthy treat without additives for my epileptic dog additives can be a seizure trigger and liver biscotti filled the bill the ingredients are top quality the bite size bits are perfect for training and do not muck up your pockets the bite size portions also make it possible to give rewards without adding pounds which is a problem with other treats and for dogs with wheat and other sensitivities there is an anti allergenic recipe enthusiastically recommended 
positive,18/6/21,i got these for my gf as she is not supposed to eat any gluten all of the flavors taste great and they seem to be much healthier than regular potato chips if you are looking for a gluten free snack i highly recommend popchips 
positive,7/7/21,i have a free sampling of these chips and i can see me swapping them for my regular chip cravings they remind me of munchos but are less greasy try them 
positive,30/6/21,i tried this chips in a hotel that i stayed at and loved them i ordered them for the office and everyone enjoyed them i am on my second order 
positive,1/7/21,i absolutely love pop chips as a healthy alternative to regular fatty chips the seat salt and pepper and the sour cream and onion are my favorites i do not crave regular chips at all 
positive,24/8/21,i picked up a few bags of these at my local heb and could not help but consume half of a bag in a day the entire stock did not last even a week for me many chips say they have a bold flavor but they never deliver these however do i tried the garlic parmessan chips and the first things i thought was how strong and delicious the parmessan was shortly followed by a garlic flavor combined with a sharp crunch i cannot have enough of these chips i am almost afraid to buy a pack because i know they will not last a month it also helps that these things are pretty healthy for you i mean they are a potato crisp so you cannot be entirely guilt free but i do not knock myself for going to town i just avoid the potato chip aisle these are on when i need to lay low on the snack foods 
positive,21/7/21,i love these chips they always make a great healthy snack when i am stuck at work with just the vending machine for sustenance 
positive,25/6/21,the sun chips are an ok substitute for the usual potato corn whatever chip cooked in oil and over salted they are not nearly as un palatable as i thought they would be have added them to my heart healthy diet regime all are good except for the multi grain style which has the texture of a sheet of plywood 
positive,13/9/21,this chips are really good and it is fun getting the variety pack now are they as good as regular chips probably not but they are also not nearly as fattening and bad for you as regular chips given that these are a healthier version if you want chips i would highly recommend them 
positive,18/6/21,tried the bbq popchips for the first time and loved them so got the value pack to try more flavors loved them all except the salt and pepper chips which were not that great good healthy snack without giving up the taste so glad i discovered these salt and vinegar are my favorite cal bag fat bag
positive,7/7/21,we will see how these work out in our family over time i am not sure that i am disciplined enough to make good use of them although it might be a good technique for teaching my dog they appear to be good for what they are a very tiny but healthy reward right now i can visualize them being used as a reward for following commands a training tool i was surprised at how tiny these treats were they seem to taste good enough but they are miniscule they are just a fraction longer than a small paperclip and about half as wide maybe as thick my dog was a little annoyed but took it when i gave it to him that was yesterday today he came in excited to get his treat looked at it as if to say you have got to be kidding then he took it and ate it a little later i offered him another one he put it on the floor and looked hopefully at his stash of larger treats but when he did not get one he went back and took this one i think these might be good for rewards for obeying commands treats that is stretching it they may also be good for my son s dog who rarely gets treats because she is overweight and would eat the whole entire refrigerator full of food if allowed at least she would get a treat large treats take her seconds she will probably inhale these one second max i like the fact that these are low fat with no added salt no refined sugar no artificial flavors colors or preservatives it says treats baked with natural peanut butter 
positive,15/7/21,i am a mom of kids with my older two i had such a hard time finding a snack for them that did not have so much sodium when my came along happyfamily introduced happymunchies i was so thankful to find a snack low in sodium and with a vegetable too and to top it off it is organic so i know it is free of pesticide residue and gmos 
positive,11/7/21,we love these baby food things in a little pouch sooooo much easier to feed to a baby or toddler on the go our son loves sucking the fruit out and we are pleased that it is both organic and healthy with nothing added just fruit for smaller ones not good to let them handle it themselves because they love to squeeze it which gets things everywhere but older ones can feed to themselves i like the size rather than the bigger one that plum organics has for some of the other flavors it assures that he will eat all or most of it in one sitting rather than having to save some for later you can also take this size on airplanes without having to have it tested for explosives not the case with the bigger pouches i also like that it is bpa free if your little one likes them ordering in bulk and with subscribe and save makes them much cheaper than at the store 
positive,7/10/21,i love vitamuffins but my supermarket sells one box of muffins for instead i bought the mix boxes for and each box makes muffins instead of per muffin the mix only requires water eggs and works out to about cents per muffin and very easy to make that is a great deal 
positive,6/7/21,i generally like vitalicious products the corn muffin well for calories it is not bad but if you are expecting anything like the sugar fat laden junk that your local bakery sells look elsewhere this is like a healthy makeover that does not quite cut it but they are not bad for the same amount of calories the chocolate one is more of an indulgence but this one is good for a bland breakfast treat especially baked fresh my kids are happy to get any extra snacks so they approve i send with them to school for a midmorning snack i am glad they get fuel and vitamins 
positive,18/6/21,my dog had been prone to ear infections and did a lot of paw chewing when his vet recommended changing his diet because his symptoms may be due to a food allergy she specifically recommended the salmon and rice formula unfortunately my dog hated the salmon and rice and it smelt extremely fishy i tried the lamb and rice formula and he likes it much better i have heard numerous good things about wellness from my dog trainer as well as other pet owners and pet store employees my dog is adjusting to the new food well however i can tell he does not consider it the most tasty of choices probably because it does not have the artificial flavoring in it but i would rather him eat something much healthier even if we have to sacrifice a little on the taste 
positive,7/7/21, length mins these cookies are so great watch our video to see how great they really are 
positive,27/7/21,actually sojo s strongly recommends that the meat you add to their mixes be raw but it an be cooked as i choose to do my dog arrived with coccidia and giardia as a puppy through veterinary mismanagement he was never completely healthy for the first years of his life after watching him get sicker on an aggressive course of antibiotics and prednisone for his inflammatory bowel disease i took him to a holistic veterinarian part of his treatment has been a homemade diet of sojo s and meat plus no medications i am extremely pleased to report he has had no gi episodes in over months and has reached a point where i consider him healthy his coat is glossy and much fluffier than before he is finally at a good weight i have before and after photos that show a dramatic improvement much of which i credit to sojo s it does take some extra time to prepare as opposed to kibble but i make days worth at a time this takes me about minutes total which includes down time while the meat is cooking and cleaning up after to be completely honest i am not thrilled about cooking for my dog but i am thrilled with the results if i was able to feed him raw perhaps down the road when our vet gives the ok preparation time would be almost nothing 
positive,13/7/21,it is also a routine baking ingredient i put it into my bread along with sunflower seeds and organic wheat flour i also put it into my smoothie stir fry dishes anything you can think of good price and really it is a must have for a healthy diet 
positive,13/9/21,i have tryed the almond crunch and is delicious and healthy snack better than chips try it you will agree
positive,7/9/21,i use the powdered tea powder in my fruit smoothies provides you all the health benefits of green tea love the product and use both the plain and lemon ginger 
positive,17/4/21,green tea is good for you loaded with antioxidants boosts your metabolism yadda yadda yadda but i never quite warmed up to the taste until now the lemon and the ginger give this a very nice flavor and it is so great that i can just add a packet to my water bottle and go without the bother of brewing it 
positive,10/3/21,i eat a lot of cereal and that includes a lot of the high fiber kinds oatmeal mini frosted shredded wheat and raisin bran are usually what i would eat when i needed to lose a few lbs but there have been a few instances where i tried the healthier options i have tried several of the kashi cereals but they were not very appetizing the plain one had a cardboard taste next i tried grape nuts which is like a horrendous yeast flavored cat food though it is closer to kitty litter in texture that brings me to fiberplus antioxidants this berry yogurt crunch is certainly one of the better tasting high fiber cereals i have eaten it is like a decent health bar broken apart into cereal the clusters of yogurt really help but even the plain cereal is decent enough on its own yes there are of sugar per serving but the of fiber and calorie parts more than make up for it especially if you compare it to raisin bran and frosted shredded wheat which are typically higher in sugar and calories yet lower in dietary fiber the antioxidants are a nice bonus too the bottom line is that i will add this to my grocery list whenever it is on sale or the price is right 
positive,17/4/21,i do not know why science diet is being referred to as junk food as it is one of the higher quality foods on the market a lot of the new organic and natural cat foods are not as healthy for pets as they are cracked up to be but regardless my veterinarian wanted me to put my year old cat on a prescription food because of the high count of crystals in her urine after some comparisons science diet mature adult active longevity is the closest to the prescription food both my cats the younger one and the older are on this food and they seem to enjoy it they both graze all day and are indoor cats so i try my best not to overfeed them my younger cat has not had issues with her urine since she went on this food and we are all happy 
positive,21/1/21,these chocolate sandwich creme cookies by whonu are every bit as delicious as similar brands but they are healthier for you true they have almost the same sugar fat and carb amounts of the best known name brand of these cookies but as others have noted they also give you fiber with noticeably more vitamins and minerals than that other brand this is a plus they are really good as a snack and it is hard to stop at the serving size of just three cookies but i guess i am allowed an occasional guilty pleasure as i write this they are a bit too expensive on this website try looking for these cookies elsewhere unless you want the convenience of having them shipped to your door overall these awesome chocolate sandwich creme cookies by whonu are the best i definitely recommend them as an excellent healthier alternative to the major name brand of this type of cookie i love them enjoy 
positive,30/1/21,we like this brownie mix and i usually use the low fat recipe on it i also add chocolate chips or something else to it otherwise it ends up a little bit dry we still buy this by the case 
positive,13/2/21,these brownies are good but the flax seed texture can be a real turn off to minimize it i added a little whole wheat flour splenda and cocoa big improvement and my guests never complained like they did the first time i made the brownies 
positive,15/1/21,we just got our first order a few days ago and my month old daughter loves them they are just like the gerber mini veggies but much cheaper although they still cost a good bit having a nutrient filled easy to take anywhere travel snack is well worth it my daughter does not have any teeth yet and she has not had any problems eating them they are light and fluffy yet full of flavor 
positive,6/3/21,i am not sure why the speciality stores in my area stopped carrying these as they were usually sold out the cakes are calories crunchy and good not like the cardboard taste of thicker rice cakes excellent as a base for pb j or to make an open face sandwich or to use in pieces like a chip for dips etc good price on the pack with a month expiration use date 
positive,8/6/21,i purchased these based on others recommendations the rice cakes are delicious thinner than the usual rice cakes in the supermarkets dense not full of air i covered them with those watching their weight can eat peanut butter for calories a serving vs for regular pb and it tastes exactly the same i too highly recommend these rice cakes 
positive,7/1/21,over of dry dog food is very unhealthy and can not even get or stars out of or diamond naturals is a great food i have afghans and i have spent many many hours of research to find this out 
positive,17/4/21,this is a very good snack that i feel great about offering my month old she can easily pick up the small pieces and definitely enjoys the apple cinnamon taste my year old loves them as well i would definitely recommend these to anyone with small or larger kids 
negative,10/3/21,something to eat if you are starving but please give real food to hungry people what is in kellogg s corn flakes milled corn sugar malt flavoring high fructose corn syrup salt yes of course it also has lots of yummy preservatives such as bht and a few synthetic vitamins and iron in minute quantities for nutrition you get basically carbs from lots of sugar and almost no protein add skim milk or you will get saturated fat with a little protein from whole milk for added nutrition include a sliced banana and a capful of wheat germ if you like corn flakes that is your business and you should enjoy them but this is not health food and it is a very poor value for more than cents an ounce per package at this price the inner package s failure to maintain freshness is an even bigger drawback when one thinks of how long it may take to finish ounces of this stuff why not use a vacuum sealed container like kretschmer s wheat germ to preserve freshness after all it is in the same price range so if you are hungry you are really eating the wrong stuff something to eat if you are starving but please give real food to other hungry people please 
positive,14/1/21,sardines are a useful item to stock for times when you want to add a bit of protein to your meal without breaking the bank i like that they are lower in mercury than big fish are and high in omega fats the skinless ones are much better tasting in my opinion regular sardines taste a bit too oily fishy and strong to me they are fairly neutral with the absence of added oil or much salt and this makes them versatile i sometimes add lemon and mayonnaise for a sandwich filling mix with egg oatmeal onion and lemon and fry for a fish patty or add them to a salad although i think these from roland are very good i liked the seasons skinless sardines which are also sold by amazon even better for flavor and texture 
positive,24/5/21,stores are not carrying this product thank goodness i can still get them genisoy soy crisps deep sea salted ounce bags pack of 
positive,14/10/21,i was really surprised when i tried this product because i found it to be a really light fluffy batter so do not think gluten free means flavorless this bisquick pancake mix will have you building up stacks of fluffy pancakes for your family it is so nice that these are healthier for you diabetic friendly and still manage to taste great too 
positive,7/2/21,i have a year old scottish terrier who has some food allergies no wheat for my girl this treat is great for settleing an upset stomach and my dog looks forward to her charcoal bone treats 
positive,29/3/21,i highly recommend these very tasty kavli thin crispbreads i wanted something different than just white bread for sandwiches i hate whole wheat i love rye i saw these noticed the ingredients could not get much simpler and gave them a try topped with cheese or a sandwich spread or whatever you would like they are very tasty i feel as full after or of these topped of course as i did with just white bread they are nice and thin so it is not like biting into anything hard just a nice crunch the flavor is not strong at all it is very mild and nothing like a rye bread you might have purchased in the past then i noticed that they are only calories per slice what is not to love they taste good they are whole grain they are super low in calories it is no crunchier than a potato chip and i feel satisfied while chewing and after eating them oh and they keep forever in the cupboard i definitely will be buying these for a long time 
positive,17/4/21,i am very pleased with this dog food have not ordered anything else for my dogs since i bought this my lab and my malti poo both eat it happily and i am happy that it is healthy for them 
positive,10/3/21,i have started buying a lot of organic food over the past year and it dawned on me that perhaps my dog should be eating more healthfully also when i look at the list of ingredients on regular dog food it is downright nauseating i bought some of this newman s own and my dog loves it she usually gobbles it up the minute i put it into the bowl 
positive,10/7/21,i signed up for the monthly subscription for this item the price is great especially without having to pay shipping charges i love the fact that i can manage the subscription by skipping a month or ordering it earlier than scheduled amazon has been excellent getting my shipments out on a timely manner newman s own organics adult dog food chicken rice formula pound bag very pleased with all my orders from amazon extremely pleased with their customer service thanks amazon 
positive,27/1/21,i feel better about feeding this product to my dogs i was using another popular brand but it contained a lot of fillers one of my dogs is pickier so he would prefer a meatier taste but he does clean it up eventually 
positive,1/6/21,our family loves these tasty and healthy sesame honey almonds by trader joe s you get the crunchy flavor of the sesame seeds combined with the subtle sweetness of the honey and almond flavoring wow it is a great snack that you feel good while eating it is my favorite of trader joe s almond snacks almonds are good for you and a handful of these in the morning with a fruit smoothie or as a snack at lunch is a great way to get protein the healthy fat and the vitamin e that almonds offer it is a good idea to measure out cup of these almonds or count the almonds out to stay in the calorie range you want to keep within nutritionist recommend having a small amount of almonds or walnuts each day for good fat and protein 
positive,20/8/21,i love these cookies i am on the paleo diet right now and these cookies are what i look forward too i do like the taste of the tropical one the best they all have different taste but if you want something that is grain free and gluten free then this is the right place i expected the taste to be different and it is other reviewers seem to expect them to taste like oreos or chips ahoy of course not when i eat them i do not even feel bad about it because my body welcomes them they do not make me crash either and feel like i ate junk food it is a good indicator that these were made from all natural ingredients i wish i had these cookies close to me i would buy them every single day 
positive,14/8/21,the flavor of the fruit enclosed is outstanding bluberry and if there is a drawback it is that the blanket that encloses the fruit is a bit thick unlike this companys fig bars and pastry textured flavored with cane syrup not fruit juice cal per bar and low in fat and the carbs not too bad considering the great taste 
positive,21/4/21,of the erin baker products the fruit nut mini breakfast cookie is my favorite i have one mini breakfast cookie about calories with a cup of coffee in the morning and i feel satisfied and ready to start the day very healthy low in caloreis and super delicious is what makes the product work for me try it you will like it 
positive,1/4/21,i adopted my adorable edmund last year from a shelter they sent me home with a small bag of felidae not grain free version cat and kitten dry formula as he was a kitten at the time i am very concerned about eating healthy whole foods so i of course want the best for my kitty as well i did research and found that cats digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains fruits vegetables directly and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey s stomachs ie if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it so i wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what is found in nature as possible without breaking the bank he already seemed to really like the felidae grain included version so as soon as my starter bag ran out i immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has only eaten this ever since i got him he loves it i give him one small scoop of grain free kibble in the morning and then a partial can of this large felidae grain free food we have tried both the turkey chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and edmund prefers the turkey chicken but will eat anything i give him i bought some can lids at petsmart and they seal air tight on these cans so fridge storage is clean and easy he has the absolute softest shiniest fur coat i have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy we have not had a single vet visit since i adopted him even though he had chronic upper respiratory issues when i got him they all cleared up i have to blame at least some of all this on the fact he only eats grain free felidae food the rest is because i love him so ridiculously much i love the free shipping on amazon i buy a case of canned and a bag of dry or two of one at the same time i used to buy this elsewhere and since it is so heavy shipping would often be almost as much as the product 
positive,17/4/21,these are very healthy grains and very light and crispy perfect with dips or salsa tastes just like rice cake they are very easy on the teeth too for those who have dental work that they do not want to chip hard to find in supermarkets 
positive,10/3/21,this product is delicious i will say this upfront thou semi messy why not place the peanut butter in the center instead on the back the taste is great so great that i started to eat them all day not good as it ruins the enjoyment these are actually so good i had to stop eating them i guess i over did it value excellent snack for everyone all my friends love them family shipping fast as always with amazon prime membership days packaging boxes total each contains individually wrapped granola thins of granola bar but flat with peanut butter on one side seriously also do not ruin the granola as i did by eating every day also i notice to avoid mess just open with scissors pealing makes a mess exclusively
positive,22/4/21,if anyone is looking for delicious and healthy snack doctor kracker is an answer however the hard crispiness is for people with good teeth 
negative,25/4/21,i ordered a flat of food they were on sale that contained chicken apple compote dinner it contained of this variety and he liked the first one but the others although properly sealed were solid and moldy and stinky one of the turkey dinners in the flat was also improperly sealed the lid popped we were lucky because i just happened to check that one now i am so paranoid that i check all of them several times i called earth s best and they assured me that they have not had this problem before and that i should not worry about it i am so suprised that this got passed qa qc inspection at a baby food manufacturer why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety we also recently opened other jars in this flat after my son refused to eat them and realized that they were rotten of them were completely solid and domed at the top we poked a toothpick down to the bottom of the jar and it was dry throughout shortly after eating his last dinner of this box my son started vomiting and refused to eat we have contacted the usda about this if this happens to you please same your jars so you can give them the information they need it may prevent other babies from getting sick i will never buy anything from earth s best again 
positive,1/4/21,arrowhead mills organic savory herb stuffing has a very nice blend of herbs for a flavor that compliments chicken and turkey i especially appreciate the fact that there are no transfats used in this stuffing so i and my family can enjoy it without worry the stuffing is very easy to prepare but really adds to the meal we use it all year long why wait for a holiday to enjoy good food 
positive,30/6/21,soon after one dog was diagnosed with renal failure yes she ate all the foods on that recall list my westie became ill and could not hold any food the vet did all sorts of tests but i had to find something gentle enough for him to keep down that night i met a rep from nutro at my local petco she told me all about natural choice gave me literature and a website to learn more i purchased this canned food along with a small bag of the dry food to mix with it turns out the dog had some sort of virus but the food was the only food he could keep down to regain his strength due to skin allergies known to westies i have kept him on this food and find it is the best for him i just do not understand though how this is sold so cheap on amazon thru petco it is case in the store and on their website i think they should keep the price regulated throughout 
positive,1/3/21,my dog has many food allergies but these made in the usa treats are free of wheat corn egg and dairy my dog cannot get enough of them 
positive,29/1/21, stars is a compromise between my rating of and my grandchildren s rating of stars i thought the flavor was too heavy on the apple grape juice combo and light on the orange tangerine flavor also it left a mild canned aftertaste but my year old granddaughters loved it and consider it a treat equal to soda it is juice concentrate which has been reconstituted with carbonated water so it is much healthier for them than regular soda while it is true it still has sugar natural sugars from the juices are healthier than processed sugars found in soft drinks the can i was sent contained ounces which is a better size for them than a regular ounce can of soda for children this is a tasty and healthy alternative 
positive,17/4/21,i am a die hard soda pop fan i will drink juice but normally only certain brands or with a little soda or sprite mixed in to kill the after taste and to sweeten it up a bit well this is better that even that mix without the bad stuff from the soda it has a crisp clean orange taste with a nice tangerine undertone that continues through the after taste it is effortless to drink and does not make you feel sluggish afterwords it is hard to describe other than to say they got it right no extra sugar yet it is very sweet but not too sweet i shared my can with my wife and she agreed with my comments we both we were sad that we only got the one little can to review and not the entire case while i am not sure it could replace my coke it sure could replace my juice and some of my coke intake the only problem there always seems to be something is that it is about times the cost of my coke per oz i could justify twice the cost but four times is the only reason i have not ordered more so far i do expect to breakdown and buy a case but i still will not be happy over the cost difference 
positive,10/3/21,i love everything about this drink it is got plenty of carbonation even without added sugar or artificial sweeteners it is plenty sweet without being too sweet i love tangerine and this has a very tangerine y flavor and aroma if you love oranges or tangerines this is the perfect drink for you i ordered this from the vine program out of curiosity but it will be one of my must buy items in the future i am also going to buy some for my grandchildren since it has no added sugars and i know they will love it it will be perfect for them 
positive,30/5/21,i quit sodas over a year ago due to the unhealthiness of them i do however like bubbly drinks but i do not need the sugar or sodium that is why this product is perfect it is fruit juice carbonated for the bubbliness orange is one of my favorite flavors this drink is the perfect drink i think this product is even better than orange soda orange soda is sticky but this product is not it has the perfect amount of sharpness which i love because it is fruit juice it also has the perfect amount of natural sweetness so this product is all the good things rolled into one fruit juice no added sugar bubbly awesome orange flavor it is so good it is hard to believe you are drinking something healthy 
negative,28/9/21,unlike another product i reviewed for vine at least this product does not have sugar per se in it it is carbonated water added to a concentrate mixture of in this order apple grape tangerine and last as well as least acai concentrate the first two on the list apple and grape are two of the most common fruit sweeteners used in beverages etc that is why the product tastes sweetened it has calories quite a lot for oz of flavored carbonated water and all of it is from carbohydrates grams and over of the carbs grams are sugars apple and grapes have some of the highest concentrations of fructose a fruit sugar that not only commonly appears in commercial beverages because it is sweeter than regular cane sugar and thus it is cheaper to use but it is also known to because diarrhea particularly in children so another drink on the hit parade of pretend healthy drinks appealing to the masses concern for their ever growing girth and deluding them that this will help forestall continued growth you are better off drinking diet coke you would be even more better off buying the sparkling flavored waters with no calories my favorite is bella familglia in pomegranate lime lemon and orange flavors and is sold from time to time on amazon as well as your local supermarket better yet buy some organic pure fruit juice such as pomegranate and pour cup in a glass of your favorite sparking water or a quarter cup in a oz bottle of your favorite sparkling water at least it is the actual juice and not some fructose extract 
positive,6/5/21,i was really surprised at the taste of the switch orange tangerine drink it reminds me of carbonated orange juice it is a little on the sweet side but not too bad in my opinion this is actually a beverage that i could drink all the time and not get tired of the best thing about switch is that it is healthy for you and it does not have any added sugars and it has a lot of vitamin c switch is a all natural beverage which is great you can have the carbonation of a soda without all the unhealthy unnatural ingredients of a soda if you want a great tasting drink that is healthy for you then i highly recommend switch if you like orange juice then i think you will really enjoy this the cans are a little on the smaller side though 
positive,20/4/21,my teens and their friends drink regular soda pop by the gallon they are obviously addicted to the stuff a very unhealthy habit i cannot drink soda pop myself it is been years or so since i had one and so i began searching for a drink that tasted like regular soda pop but was not unhealthy i searched high and low for a suitable alternative and then i found izze i love the fruity tangy flavor of izze s sparkling grafefruit soda the grapefruit flavor goes well with spicy mexican foods but it is also great just by itself my teens love izze and drink it now just like soda pop i am so happy to know they are not guzzling down corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors but instead are enjoying all natural izze with no added sweeetners if you are looking for a great alternative to regular soda pop you cannot do better than to buy izze 
positive,20/4/21,sticks and twigs may seem a little pricey compared to regular pretzels but the bag lasts a long time and the ingredients like flax seeds quinoa chia seeds and curry are good for you they are very crunchy but tasty for some added protein i like to dip them in peanut butter 
positive,21/4/21,usually healthy food is hard to swallow not these fresh crunchy delicious pumpkin seeds i switched from potato chips and my wife tells me they are good for the prostate what do i know i am taking her word for it 
positive,2/5/21,i had never tried bob s red mill pumpkin seeds although i have used and been very happy with many of their other products i was looking for pumpkin seeds from pumpkins grown in the usa most of the organic seeds are from china the bob s red mill seeds are from pumpkins grown in oregon i took the plunge and ordered bags of these seeds and they arrived in less than hours four sealed bags were also in a sealed bob s red mill box and then packaged in a larger amazon box i just opened one bag of the seeds to try them they are way better than what i was getting at my local whole food store in bulk these seeds are chewy as they should be and not hard or stale with any off taste these have a slight pumpkin taste which they should have this variety of seed is rounder and flatter than some of the other pumpkin seed varieties i have had which i like no pointy ends to stab me as i am munching them down all in all a great buy seeds stars grown in the usa stars total stars 
negative,25/5/21,give me better ingredients kind larabars for more or sweeter items genuine junk for less not sure i would invest in a single bar again let alone this size 
positive,7/9/21,i was very satisfied with my purchase of nutiva hemp seeds i ordered a pack of them and it arrived fairly quickly they taste great on their own but i usually add them to protein shakes to enhance the amino acid profile or sprinkle them on top of salads for added flavor and texture my supply is almost gone so i will definitely be ordering more one of the reviews said there were still shells in the bag but i did not find any in mine 
positive,25/5/21,i used the hemp seeds every morning with my protein shake the taste is great and they are so healthy 
positive,22/5/21,when i was told by my nutritionist that eating a handful of whole natural almonds a day would help me to lose weight and get the right kind of fats and proteins implemented into my diet i was a bit skeptical i was not a huge almond fan to begin with i do not particularly enjoy salted or roasted almonds usually only the kind that come surrounded with coconut and chocolate or the kind that you get out of the nut bowl to she will around the holidays the whole natural almonds by blue diamond taste like they came right out of the she will and boy are they yummy i like that they are a satisfying snack and i like the taste of them these are the ones i buy no added salt or anything nice and fresh right out of the she will stars 
positive,19/7/21,if you want a truly healthy filling snack you must give these a try as well as their sisters the vanilla bean almonds they are both just lightly sweetened and fragrant with either the cinnamon or the vanilla depending on which you choose the container is marvelous there is a half flip top which is easy to do with one hand like in the car and they are not roasted in more oil so the almonds are meaty and sweet and almonds are sooo good for you i would recommend that you try them and then get an amazon subscribe and save if you can it is well worth it and all natural lovely 
positive,7/9/21,i would not call these almonds sweet but they do have just the right hint of sweet flavor that the almond is elevated and feels like a treat the taste and texture of almonds does not particularly appeal to me but they are such a healthy snack that i am glad to find this delicious option also the small container is the perfect size to have on your desk or keep in the car or use as stocking stuffers like i plan to do for a couple of my healthy eating conscious friends 
positive,25/8/21,the almonds tastes all right since it is too dry the salt can hardly stay on surface therefore it is not salty enough on the whole it is a healthy snack i hope this type of almonds can have subscription service and discount 
positive,6/9/21,these almonds taste good not as well flavored as the cinnamon or vanilla flavored but a decent change of pace a little plain though 
positive,25/5/21,my review is for the cinnamon cookie in the small bag i love them i do not have gluten issues but i like the fact that the cookies are gluten free they are crunchy and satisfy my desire for something sweet only caloriesand g of fat in three cookies each pack has cookies g of saturated fat trans fat cholesterol mg sodium g fiber g of carbs and g of protein yummy every bite starbucks carries them sporadically and i am so glad to be able to buy them from amazon 
positive,7/9/21,i love almonds in general and this particular brand is quite good they taste great with just the right amount of salt and oil for me anyway they are individually packaged in oz cans which makes them an easy and portable snack portion control is also easier with the small can size i have ordered a few packs of these almonds and while there is some slight variation in the taste from batch to batch some are roasted a bit darker than others i have always found them fresh and tasty almonds are relatively healthy too high in protein a good source of magnesium calcium and manganese and full of unsaturated fats i have not seen organic roasted salted almonds from this company but i hope they offer them eventually at a decent price one thing i would also like to see is some kind of assurance that the can liner is free of bpa 
positive,13/10/21,i was a skeptic about this product until i tried it with skim milk this cereal is delicious and retains its crunch even after minutes of being soaked in milk i enjoy its texture and caramelly flavor i think it could definitely be less sweet and lower carb but so far i find this cereal to have the highest fiber content the other vitamins and minerals a single serving contains is also comparable to similar products by other companies this is perfect for breakfast or a snack any time of the day 
positive,2/10/21,we were pleased with this salt it is actually more salty than regular salt even kosher salt or sea salt a little bit goes a long way i do not usually cook with it but add it to things afterwards i have been hand grinding it 
positive,23/9/21,right now i own cats that i found outside a good eight years ago and i found another cat which i adopted also i have always fed them eukanuba adult lamb rice dry cat food and they truly love it when you first open the bag you can smell the savory aroma of the cats that i found outdoor and adopted one turned out to be a turkish angora and the other has markings similar to that of a snow leopard and the third cat i found out is part egyptian mau i also feed a feral cat who has been living in my back yard for years they all love this food and even when they changed the formula of this food a few years ago they still eat it and love it if you read the ingredients it is excellently made and a real plus for their diet they have been eating it for years now and i have yet to see any of my cats turn up their nose to this food the other dry foods that my cats love is fancy feast gourmet filet mignon flavor with real seafood shrimp dry cat food and they have just started eating eagle pack natural pet food indoor formula for cats and a cat food brand called artemis i have not any problems with them eating any of these dry foods and i have been rescuing cats for over years now and have owned as many as cats at one time one set of kittens were born outdoor and i brought them indoors with their mother and kept them all until the day they passed on they all lived to be close to years of age and they too ate eukanuba lamb rice and loved it i have had foods that they turned up their nose with like chicken soup and taste of the wild the same way we humans have our likes and dislikes is the same way that these cats have their likes and dislikes what is good for one cat might not be good for another you just have to learn your cat and see what they like and just give it to them while my cats are in love with eukanuba lamb rice maybe your cat will also or maybe not but it is not fair to not try this food because of a review where the owner says that their cat does not like it as previously stated maybe your cat will not like it or maybe your cat will love it i have tried cat foods based on good reviews figuring that the food will automatically be a hit and sometimes it was and sometimes it was not it is all up to the cat 
positive,26/6/21,when pet promise a safe and healthy pet food went out of business i was desperately looking for another healthy food that had no by products rendered fats meat meals or outsourced ingredients you might want to check out what these types of ingredients can include if your stomach can take it but avoid commercial manufacturers spins on this good books to get in this regard are foods pets die for and protect your pet food pets die for shocking facts about pet food protect your pet more shocking facts my cats were completely unaffected by the melamine contamination tragedy of which killed many pets especially cats because their pet promise food was one of the few brands in america that did not use outsourced ingredients and was never on the recall list unlike some of the very expensive premium brands i felt so lucky that i had already switched to pet promise a petfood company that bought ingredients only from north american farmers using sustainable agriculture and free range livestock i finally discovered halo s products and was encouraged by the fact that ellen degeneres a devout animal lover herself not only endorses it but also has become part owner of the company their website also included a specific message written to us former pet promise users so i went to my health food store and bought some i was delighted to see that it had no by products no rendered meats no meat meals and that the label stated that all its ingredients are made in the usa except the pea protein from canada furthermore the salmon in halo is wild alaskan not farmed salmon aka pharmed salmon full of antibiotics etc moreover it is low in carbohydrates and even includes probiotics in the mix making it even more promising than pet promise but the ultimate test was whether my cats would eat it or not unlike my dachshunds who would eat just about anything that hit the floor they are really low to the ground you know cats are notorious for their persnickety eating habits but they love it cannot get enough so i have to dole it out so they do not overeat and after five months their health and energy seem to be great oh and hi ellen and many thanks 
positive,25/5/21,ironically i am an amazon seasonal worker i discovered these tasty treats while working on the sales floor i kept thinking wow i sure ship alot of these things what are they so i went home and checked them out on line for myself i am a very active and healthy person i am always looking for wholesome breakfast options i have a hard time eating in the am these cookies are so filling and delish i eat one at around am and i am fine until lunch healthy ingredients to fuel your busy day lifestyle i cannot wait to put them in my back pack when i go hiking next 
positive,7/9/21,slightly biased because this company was started near my hometown but i have been a fan of erin baker s breakfast cookies for years since i first noticed them popping up at coffee shops back home now living on the other side of the country i was pleasantly surprised to find them on amazon and even more excited to find them at such a great price store them in the freezer pop them in the toaster and it is like eating a fresh baked cookie that is full of good things for you and keeps you from getting hungry till lunch high in fiber and much better tasting than any energy bar out there who does not love a cookie for breakfast i love these things will be ordering more soon to keep our freezer well stocked 
positive,15/7/21,my dog loves these and everyone i have shared with agrees it is a great snack why feed grains and dog bones when you can offer a high protein healthy snack that promotes good health 
negative,3/6/21,do not fed your dog any happy hip dogswell product it is not safe google it if your dog has eaten them regularly have the vet do blood work
positive,27/9/21,after trying a number of other chocolate chip cookie mixes my husband and i were beginning to wonder if any gluten wheat and dairy free cookies could taste better than sawdust pamela s chocolate chunk cookie mix was a revelation tastes as good as regular chocolate chip cookies delicious 
positive,19/6/21,these whenever bars taste like soft chocolate chip cookies the coconut flavor is very good and natural tasting do not be deceived by the size of the package the wrapper is much larger than the bar still it is a satisfying snack and comes in at a respectable calories i eat them around mid morning or as a late night snack i do not avoid gluten wheat or dairy these bars are wheat free gluten free and non dairy but do enjoy organic foods and was pleased to see healthy ingredients including oats agave chia seeds brown rice flour etc once these become available in the subscribe and save program i feel certain i will subscribe they are great to have around for a low calorie sweet treat 
positive,25/5/21,these are even tastier than the original flavor works great in belgian waffle maker too why are they not priced right and available by subscription 
positive,7/9/21,finding great tasting steel oats that cook as quickly as processed oatmeal is not easy to do these oats can even be microwaved and never get gummy i originally found these in california while visiting family and could not find them in virginia when i returned home you have to purchase two big bags minimum when getting them from the internet and they are big bags but i intend to share one with friends 
positive,3/8/21,my husband and i have been making a serious effort to change our eating habits and be healthy which is why i purchased this product i was concerned about the highly processed vegetable oil we had been using and the way the oil can become carcinogenic when cooked at high heat now this is true for any oil it should not be heated past it is smoke point avocado oil has a very high smoke point making it a perfect healthy choice it has healthy fats for your heart and tastes yummy i also recommend macadamia oil for the same reasons amazon shipped these right away and they were perfect if you have a misto this is a great oil to put in it we will definitely keep this on hand 
positive,5/9/21,i have a senentary job and like to munch on things after steadily gaining weight i decided that what i was munching on was not doing me any favors enter dried and bake dried fruit there is no guilt if i polish off an entire bag in one sitting although i do try to refrain from doing so the bare fruit brand is great because these are baked dried they are crunchy like chips and the only ingredients are apples and cinnamon because of the shrinkage you can eat more than you mean to but it is far better than eating anything artificial amazon s price is very competitive i originally bought these from marshall s and tj maxx for two dollars twenty nine cents 
positive,25/5/21,this is part of my regular order now i love it i used it when i did the master cleanse and it was perfect 
positive,7/9/21,my month daughter loves these she is been eating them since around mos old because of the bag is a full fruit and veggie serving i sometimes give them to her along with her main dish at lunch time they are also great for snack time and it is good to know that they are healthy and count towards her daily fruit veggie servings when fresh fruit and veggies are not readily available i also love that both flavors of these fruit veggie melts are a completely mess free snack which is always a plus 
positive,11/9/21,somersaults are a terrific snack addictive really healthier than most snacks and very convenient packaging be warned you will want more 
positive,13/7/21,this is an outstandingly good cereal it is not too sweet is delicious and healthy too a nice choice for anyone wanting to live a healthy life 
positive,22/7/21,i could not find these in a store so i ordered them through amazon if you want a healthy snack with just enough chocolate to kill the craving this is it 
positive,22/6/21,i have started eating almonds as a healthy alternative to fatty or high carb snacks but wanted something to satisfy my sweet tooth on occasion these cocoa roast almonds fit the bill nicely they just have a dusting of cocoa so there is no more fat or unhealthy stuff than you would find in regular almonds but you still get a nice chocolate taste they are just a little bit sweeter than i really want i like dark chocolate semisweet or bittersweet but still a great once in awhile snack 
positive,28/7/21,these have a lot less sugar than other brands but still a lot of chocolate flavor i would eat plain almonds every now and then but they left my mouth dry these are addictive and i eat them every day they make a great healthy snack 
positive,13/10/21,best dark chocolate ever i wish it was stocked well at amazon
positive,19/2/21,i found this snack to be tasty healthy and satisfying when i microwaved it it was delicious also very convenient for snacking on go 
positive,14/12/20,i am a fan of kashi it seems that everything they make is not only quite healthy but also very tasty my father cannot stand the health food that i buy but he had one of these and actually liked it i will convert him yet 
positive,14/12/20,this bar was given out to serious mountain bikers during a recent race and i had a chance to sample one i found it delicious and because of it is raw live essence food content it is also a healthy snack alternative that is easy to carry with you i always have one in my lunch bag or carry one with me when i am out shopping all day it does have a slight oily feel but i do not find it objectionable i highly recommend it 
positive,19/2/21,if your daily water consumption is not at least for women for men a day then it really does not matter what kind of water you drink work on getting your consumption up to the minimum if you are drinking upwards of a gallon of water a day then picking a water of atrisian type is greatly worth the health benefits also plastic is quite detrimental to your health so getting an item like voss in the glass bottles instead of plastic is worth the price tag otherwise just buy glass bottle of voss and reuse the bottle if you feel the need to impress your friends trust me no one drinks voss to impress anyone people who do are morons and everyone around them already knows it 
positive,10/1/21,pros no added sugar g per tbsp serving no added salt mg per serving great taste organic no stirring needed cons expensive even for sunflower butter we paid per jar here at amazon with free shipping thin consistency closer to a pourable topping than a butter a bit higher in calories than many nut seed butters cal per serving this makes a nice optional butter for anyone with allergies facility is peanut and tree nut free or someone just looking for variety it is a bit messy to use because of how thin it is on the plus side though i am sure i use less than a serving on my sandwich to avoid having it drip or squirt out which keeps calories lower it remains thin when refrigerated which the package recommends after opening to maintain freshness we eat a reduced sodium and low sugar diet and did find that we could tell that this was made without either it is definitely less sweet than a no added sugar peanut butter since we usually make our sandwiches with either a banana or strawberries we did not mind the missing sweetness but someone used to a more traditional butter product may amazon shipping on this product was fast and without any problems usps 
positive,26/3/21,i use sunbutter as part of a program to lower blood pressure and it works but i would eat sunbutter anyway simply for the taste of it if you love sunflower seeds this is a product for you many people need the nutrients of sunflower seeds but cannot digest seeds folks with crohn s disease ulcerative colitis diverticulitis for example they can however enjoy the taste and nutrients of sunflower seeds with this product i but this in multiples because so many friends and family members become hooked after trying a jar at my house it tastes best in my humble opinion on toast it is richer in healthy oils than other spreadable products but i stir it up as soon as i open a jar then refrigerate it the oil does not separate again although i do give it a quick stir with a knife before spreading it on toast highly recommended 
positive,24/3/21,i add boneless chicken breast peppers onions and string beans and simmer until the chicken is done i ate this dish over cup of brown rice for dinner for months straight when dieting losing a total of lbs i did not get sick of this dish as it is so tasty the calorie and contents of this dish fit the specs of the diet that i was on delicious way to lose weight 
positive,24/2/21,this item is a healthy and inexpensive treat for the whole family easily enjoyed while driving watching tv or almost anything with no salt it is great for restricted sodium diets 
positive,19/2/21,these cereal bars are great the ones with strawberry and blueberry are the best they are chewy but still soft 
positive,14/12/20,i have ordered this cereal twice so far from amazon i can find it at our local health market but it costs more locally than buying a three pack from amazon the best by dates are always good this last pack had months from purchase my family really enjoys the taste though it does not taste like kelloggs raisin bran peace one cup serving has calories fat sodium total carbs dietary fiber sugar protein kellogs one cup has same calories fat sodium total carbs dietary fiber sugar protein this may not be for everyone but i love a raisin bran cereal and knowing peace has half the sugar makes me love it even more 
positive,19/10/21,i just ordered boxes of solbites to give to my customers at fiat of montgomeryville within a week the supply was depleted great packaging great taste great addition to the cluttered assortment of snacks solbites gets five stars from fiat of montgomeryville look for our next order 
positive,18/5/21,these bars are great for a snack they have alot of healthy ingredients and low sugar the bars have a good flavor from the coconut it is hard to find bars that do not have soy ingredients as well 
positive,19/2/21,have been using riceselect royal blend for years as the healthier tastier alternative to plain brown rice and plain white rice after my local supermarket stopped carrying it i was delighted to find it on amazon com at a lower price than in the supermarket 
positive,14/12/20,if you want a healthy treat and one that is very satisfying try the lara bars an important plus is that is soy free which is important to a lot of people these days 
positive,1/6/21,i buy these for the whole family coconut cream pie is our favorite flavor we also like the chocolate varieties and key lime pie my and sons think these are a real treat since they are so sweet i love the simple natural ingredients too they are a little pricey but healthier foods usually are 
positive,1/4/21,we really enjoyed this product containes no sugar contains dates and such and it is healthy while giving you the chocolate fix you need 
positive,15/4/21,quitting sugar is hard nana s cookies make it much easier i get to enjoy the sweet chocolately taste i crave without the sugar or chemicals in most other cookies they are delicious and very satisfying because they are sweetened with fruit juice my blood sugar does not get spiked so i do not get a high followed by a crash after eating these cookies nor do i feel addicted to them like i do when i eat products made with sugar and i like that they are gluten free since we are bombarded by products made from wheat and i crave a variety of grains like oats and rice i highly recommend these cookies i eat them regularly and they fulfill my craving for sweets which has been so helpful in making better food choices when i am faced with temptation and on amazon they are priced very reasonably and worth every penny 
positive,19/5/21,my dog has numerous food allergies so finding a treat that passes the allergy test and one that he likes can be difficult add to this the fact that he is definitely not motivated by food and rewarding him with treats can be challenging my four footed wonder absolutely loves the get naked gut health dental chew sticks and if he could he would give them five stars himself 
positive,19/2/21,after suffering from flu like symptoms for a week i tried this tea with honey and it was not only delicious but after using for a day i feel so much better 
positive,14/12/20,i am very careful these days what i eat due to a recent diagnosis one of the things i watch is message read some reports on it and you will understand why everything in my cupboard had message in it this does not the risk is always will it taste good message adds a lot of salt and what the brain reads as flavor and sometimes removing it can seem like a reduction in flavor not so with this product it is so good i use it wherever and whenever i can i am finding that i do not have to use very much so it goes quite far i now have the vege beef and onion flavored versions and they are all good mmmmmmm happy tummy 
positive,28/7/21,i bought these almonds because amazon had a good sale going on i really liked them i usually buy a couple of pounds of unroasted unsalted almonds a week at the local grocery store sold by a well known national brand these back to nature almonds were far superior they were fresher i also like the pack that could be resealed they came in convenient packs so that you do not have to have a huge bag open while you try to finish it if you use almonds you will enjoy these 
positive,29/6/21,great organic dog food from a company i trust my dog eats it happily and heartily with the automatic delivery option the pricing is the cheapest i have been able to find both on line and in the stores definitely recommend 
positive,15/10/21,i prefer to stick with organic versions of the dirty dozen in produce which sadly includes most berries but i also try to follow my pediatrician s advice to have my son eat the rainbow each day that gets tough especially when we get into fall winter when fresh fruits and veggies are fewer and far between organic berries like the strawberries and raspberries in this product are expensive hard to find and definitely out of season right now here in ny enter ella s red one smoothie fruits these pouches are great to have around as an option to round out my toddler s colorful fruit intake for the day not to mention they are delicious think applesauce with sweet berries added for extra flavor and flair and they are ideal when we are on the go with a few of these tossed into my diaper bag i always have something healthy and organic on hand for him to enjoy they are even a nice snack for me when i find myself a bit low on energy when we are out and about the crushed fruit inside these pouches is smooth almost baby food consistency so it slurps up through the straw like top easily once i have unscrewed the cap my month old can eat this entirely without my help leaving my hands free to get stuff done sweet 
positive,20/7/21,this bar is the perfect snack for late afternoon or whenever you feel lethargic or hungry especially when you know you are eating something good for your body i guess they are a bit expensive but for a product that has added antioxidants and is gluten free i guess that is about right at least amazon offers a great discount 
positive,12/10/21,great product no fat all natural nothing added great crunch and taste favorite company by far 
positive,19/2/21,i do not like cinnamon and i do not like apples so i was surprised when a friend offered me bare fruit organic bake dried cinnamon apple chips ounce bags pack of and i liked it i figured i would like it even more without cinnamon so i found these on amazon and oh my they are amazing i have eaten one full pound and have not experienced any bad chips like the one reviewer who said they were musty my roommate ate the other pound and said one chip was incredibly sour but all the others were great the only reason i took off a star is because the packaging did not include nutrition information it was easy enough to find on livestrong but i definitely think it should be included because the chips are all different sizes they do not give an easy to visualize amount say cup this many calories you really need a foods scale to know how much you are eating but in case its of any use to anyone grams of chips is calories g is carbs and g fiber i gave some to my dad to try he grows about different varieties of fruit trees including apples he said he is dried apples before and they taste the same as these he takes care not to use anything non organic or unhealthy so its good they taste the same also for some reason they store better in the shiny bag they ship in i divided one bag into ziplocs to be able to grab for snacks and they got sort of soft whereas the chips kept in the original bag inside a ziplock stayed crispy and fresh 
positive,14/12/20,i just got these in the mail today and cannot stop eating them no fat no added sugar just pure crunchy apple slices they are wonderful 
positive,2/7/21,my dog loves these treats the ingredients are so good for her and they do not because any allergies or reactions either great product

positive,22/7/19,i love this organic coconut manna i eat it by the spoonful and i use it for cooking it has a light pleasant coconut flavor the packaging is convenient and keeps the product fresh the benefits of coconut are wonderful give it a try 
positive,12/1/20,i take a spoonful of coconut manna every day this is a blend of coconut oil and the coconut meat and it tastes sweet and yummy very good antifungal and a healthy oil for heart brain hair joints i use regular coconut oil for cooking some people complain about it separating which is true but i use a fork and rake it from the glass to the middle then it is easy to take a spoonful you could gently heat it in a pot of hot water and then mix it up but i never heat it i prefer the glass jar to the newer plastic they are using but i am happy it is organic 
positive,19/2/20,these are absolutely delicious and healthier than other cookies since made with wheat flour rice syrup and cane juice rather than white flour and sugar my kids love them and enjoy them as a snack with a glass of milk 
positive,27/11/19,green tea is a great diuretic and this is particularly tasty and soothing fresh product green tea also has cholesterol lowering qualities along with fat burning and lots of antioxidants studies have been done using green tea for dementia and certain cancers as well and no pill to swallow 
positive,12/12/19,liquid aminos have been a staple in my food seasonings for a long time i buy in bulk on amazon since its a much better deal and the bottles are so much bigger i will never use regular soy again since this literally tastes the exact same yet is so much better for you i am so glad to have found this product and even more glad that amazon sells it in bulk 
positive,26/9/20,these are great snacks for my kids and my teenagers even like them better for them than high preservative and or high calorie snacks and they give them some good carbs and protein 
positive,22/7/19,these almond butter balls are a unique and delicious snack chock full of almond bits all over the exterior of the ball these provide a nice dose of fiber protein and healthy monounsaturated fats which other snacks often lack unlike other betty lou s balls this flavor does not contain whey dairy protein so it is suitable for vegans or dairy allergy sufferers also just as a tip these are very soft so i always smush thumb knead out the ball until it is a flat square taking up the entire area of the plastic packaging they are much more satisfying to eat pick at and last longer that way a great option when you are sick of bars i only wish they were organic hence the missing star and that betty lou s made more dairy free balls 
positive,2/2/20,my kids absolutely love these they appeal to all my kids from my year old to my year old we will be on automatic reorder from now on 
positive,23/5/20,i received my box of pure natural bars right before going on a long road trip i took several of the bars with me hoping that they would satisfy my hunger pangs while i traveled i am pleased to report that these little snack bars did a great job of keeping my tummy happy and i did not feel like i was eating something packed with preservatives or artificial ingredients the mixture of fruits and nuts provides a sweet and nutty flavor experience that is a nice change from other bland or over sweetened snack bars pros natural ingredients pleasant texture great taste cons wrapper is a little difficult to remove due to bars being slightly sticky overall i recommend these snack bars for anyone who wants a convenient snack on the go without feeling guilty about artificial ingredients 
positive,22/11/20,i was pleased with the ingredients in these bars i thought that there could have been a slightly bolder fruit flavor the peanuts were plentiful and that was a plus for me overall i would rate them a good buy and would definitely consider purchasing them 
positive,30/3/20,it is a tub of mixed nuts i will spare you a long winded review on them i have tried the mixed nuts they sell locally which have a lot of peanuts mixed in and the difference in quality is pretty noticeable these are much firmer fresher and just taste overall better it seems the filler nut they used here were almonds which is fine and certainly better then peanuts but it is unfortunate that pecans are scarce brazil nuts are pretty generously packed in as well with moderate amounts of hazelnut filbert and cashew you get a lot of salt near the bottom naturally but otherwise there is just enough mixed in to assure that they stay flavorful from the moment you open them i would recommend these to anyone looking for a mixed nut snack much better than the rest i have tried so far 
positive,8/7/20,started eating turkey jerky lately because its a healthy snack and that is when i came across snackmasters i have tried the beef ahi tuna and salmon all taste great 
positive,4/1/20,this is a great healthy product at a good price not the first time i buy it and not the last 
positive,30/1/21,i am on my second jar and we love this stuff originally bought for popping popcorn fantastic we soon started using it as a butter substitute for just about everything toast veggies frying eggs or fish i have had people who hate coconut anything love the mild sweet taste for popcorn between the coconut oil and the agave nectar found here i do not know which i am happier with 
positive,2/11/20,i use this more often than olive oil i use olive oil for salad dressings and an occasional stir fry and this for most all other frying it has a light coconut flavor that took my year old son some time to get used to but he does not notice anymore i see people buying this in capsules as a supplement 
positive,17/10/20,these low fat rice crackers have just the right amount of wasabi heat fast service great vender individual servings stay fresh until needed 
positive,22/7/19,unlike most snacks this one is full of nutritious ingredients you will not feel guilty enjoying it 
positive,2/2/20,i picked sahale cashews with pomegranate at a starbuck s after coming from the gym they are so tasty not too sweet but sweet enough i was delighted to be able to order them on amazon they are a bit pricey but come out cheaper when you buy them in bulk vs buying single packets in local stores i will buy them again 
positive,4/10/20,like many other reviewers i first found these apple chips at costco who has since discontinued them if i would known they were going to be discontinued i would have stocked up because they were about cheaper but still the amazon price is a good deal for such a large quantity of dried apples i eat them as a snack i keep a bag at the office for this purpose and i also use them as treats for my pet bunny he goes absolutely bonkers for them the quality is great i have not found a single seed or inedible piece in the four bags i have gone through so far plus they are organic which i do not normally care about but becomes important if you are ingesting any quantity of peels definitely recommend 
positive,1/4/20,these apple chips are delicious and healthy for you they are the perfect snack especially if you are on a gluten free diet i highly recommend them they are a perfect alternative to potato chips 
positive,8/5/20,i love eating these apple chips i tried good health original apple crisps these are the ones in the fuji apple salad sold at panera bread and while yummy they are fried and have more calories this particular variety by bare fruit is baked and has less than serving so i consider this a win win 
positive,18/6/20,loved having a healthy snack that i could grab on the go they became a staple for me awesome solo or with hummus 
positive,20/8/20,this is a very tasty and healthy cracker full of dietary fiber i highly recommend it for taste low calories and texture

positive,4/7/21,this is a tea that tastes wonderful it has many positive attributes also it comes in this large box count bags i received good and speedy service from this seller 
positive,5/2/20,this is a great product even though i am a health nut the acai powder taste really good with my protein shake plus it has a high potency i will mix this powder with a chocolate protein shake and both taste and color changes which shows it is the real deal even though it is a antioxidant product you have to eat right as well to feel the effect follow the instructions really carefully put in the refrigerator after first use or else it will spoil 
positive,22/7/19,i have been purchasing this item directly at target once a week for the past four months and have been very satisfied with each purchase the nuts taste fresh they are crunchy and a good variety no peanuts i made the transition from slated nuts to these without any trouble because they are so good a great product that you will feel good about eating 
positive,2/2/20,i have enjoyed this product for several years and it was very convenient for me to be able to get it in the mail from amazon thank you 
positive,22/11/20,these are wonderful baked beans with subtle not overwhelming curry seasoning also very healthy protein fiber no saturated or trans fat only minor caveat is sodium a bit high but nothing like many beans bowls found in us stores 
positive,1/3/20,i switched my dogs to this food and i have noticed many improvements in there overall health they have shinny healthy coats of fur more energy and more regular and solid bowel movements i care about my dog s health and this product delivers good healthy ingredients and my dogs really love it 
positive,23/11/20,tastes amazing good for you small or so calories you can eat this on the go or at home for a morning snack or at work in between meals perfect in every way and organic the only con i have is the price it is almost dollars a bar which is kind of high for buying in bulk it is a small bar after all the organic protein bars i usually use contain almost twice the calories are still raw and organic though not as good tasting as this strawberry bar comes in at about the same price it can be used as a meal replacement which makes it worth the value if amazon could offer this as a subscribe and save option and get the price down to dollars i would highly recommend this and subscribe to get new ones delivered to my house twice a month these things are amazing
positive,5/4/21,for the past years my husband has been experimenting with making whole grain pancakes he is constantly trying new whole grain pancake mixes out on the family we were visiting some friends in brooklyn when he discovered the kodiak cakes at a small deli he bought the box and made them for us and we could not believe how amazing these whole grain pancakes are they are super tasty and made with amazing ingredients hands down the best whole grain pancake mix i have ever had we bought boxes to start giving away as gifts when we go to someone is house instead of giving a bottle of wine 
positive,27/4/20,i boil rice and quinoa together after rinsing will add about cup of go raw freeland live sprouted seeds to it the seeds naturally add flavor and a slight crunch to the rice and quinoa nothing else needs to be added all of the flavors mix together to provide a healthy and tasty meal 
positive,8/3/21,sometimes i see myself going for unhealthy snacks from vending machines now i take this with me everywhere i go it is perfect for quick snack healthy perfect portion delicious 
positive,30/1/20,i switched to celtic sea salt for added minerals and also because the body can process it better than table salt the taste is unbelieveable it highlights every flavor of your food i am so impressed i refuse to go back to table salt for any reason it is damp due to being taken directly from a sea bed althoug i did not get the grinder the company offers instead i got one at target it works ok i do have to shake the grinder sometimes to get it to work freely with the damp salt overall i am extermely impressed with this salt 
positive,22/7/19,my dogs love these sweet potato treats i feed my dogs grain free diets and other high end supplements so of course i wanted a treat that followed our feeding ethic this is low in protein and fat so it is gentle on the stomach of puppies and sick dogs alike my dogs go crazy over these they love the taste and since these are a little tough it takes them a bit longer to finish them which is great because dogs usually swallow treats whole they are not extremely tough though puppies can eat them even though the bag does not have an indication to refrigerate after opening please do so they will last longer and remain fresher plus you could prevent mold growth amazon sells these by far at the most affordable price specialty stores sell these treats up to twice as much as amazon does so i suggest you buy them from amazon if you want a healthy treat this is the way to go 
positive,2/2/20,you know how limited your food choices can be when your plane is delayed and the airport is pretty much closing down for the night well that is how i found mrs mays cran blueberry crunch the candy and gum kiosk at laguardia carries them and i was not going to make it tbrough a hour delay on a snickers the cran blueberry crunch was wonderful hit the spot and carried through with no sugar crash they are delicious without being overly sweet and the fruit is real fruit not dried fruit with yucky preservatives when i got hom i could not find it locally so i ordered a case from amazon and i keep a bag in my desk drawer for that late afternoon snack attack i have shared with my friends and everyone loves it enjoy 
positive,2/9/20,kind makes a range of great products with minimal additives and fresh bright flavors these clusters are nice and crunchy and great for any granola type use the clusters are not very big so this product is better for me as a yogurt topper or breakfast cereal than snacking the blueberry vanilla flavor was a bit muted but i am happy to compromise on that for such a hearty healthy product 
positive,26/1/21,i have tried a number of different granola cereals over the years including the kind healthy grains vanilla blueberry clusters with flax seeds and kind healthy grains ranks among the best for taste i would call this moderately sweet which is just fine with me but it might make this less of a hit with people with more of a sweet tooth especially kids of course you can always add sugar fruit or some other sweetener if you think it needs it as the nutrition facts on the package reveal this is a fairly healthy breakfast option there is little fat in a cup serving total fat none of which is saturated or trans fat with no cholesterol there are carbs of which only are from sugar there are also fiber sodium and a serving has calories 
positive,9/1/21,i think we have a winner here the packaging promises that the product is all natural and only contains things you can pronounce it does too flavor was very nice and not too sweet this product contains flax which i do not particularly care for but the flax was not noticeable this does have a decent amount of sesame seeds in it while i do not mind the taste of sesame seeds they did tend to get stuck in my teeth i ate this both dry and as a cereal with milk it was great both ways to me the real test for any food is will my kids eat it in this case the answer is a resounding yes additionally i brought this along to munch on at a swim meet and the kids on the team wanted a taste they all liked it too 
positive,30/7/21,this is an extremely tasty seaweed snack the biggest plus to this product however is the fact that it is roasted with olive oil most commercial seaweed snacks are roasted in rancid unhealthy canola oil or soybean oil so the only option for health conscious people was to buy the raw nori sheets and roast them ourselves which is fine but a bit of a pain kudos to seasnax for stepping in and filling the void the only downside is they are a bit pricey but that sometimes happens when a company is first to market with a compelling product hopefully others will get in on the act and competition will drive the price a bit also there is no real amazon discount vs buying at whole foods but not everybody lives near a wf and not all wf s stock this product 
positive,30/10/20,i love that my son is learning to feed himself with these healthy snacks that he loves 
positive,3/8/20,love this stuff since reading that olive oil is best just used for cold not cooked items i use it for cooking as well as a condiment on sandwiches a spread on whole grain breads and even added to protein shakes it is soooo healthy anyone reading up on it should make sure they are reading current info not old no longer valid statements i even use it on my face i ordered a jar to see if i liked it which i do and have since gone on amazon s auto ship program could not be more convenient good price savings too 
positive,29/1/21,this item is great fruit and still great tasting my kid loves these things he is a lover of fruit snacks and i have been trying to find something that is healthy and tasteful and i have found it

positive,19/10/21,you can find these here with free shipping and it will save you a trip to the bumper car parking lot of the mall this is higher quality dog food i know you may not care but most brands they sell in the supermarket are really bad for your dog shaving off years of their life i buy the weight control formula for becky the beagle and she has lost enough wieght to actually run and she did so without starving if that is even possible for a beagle worth every penny if you can get the free shipping i have a deductable on my car and hate going to the mall bumper car parking lots 
positive,20/10/21,this tasty cereal has everything going for it it taste good and has grams of whole grains which is of your daily minimum of whole grain needs from one bowl it has a decent amount of fiber and calcium good for your morning breakfast or as a snack when you are on the run 
positive,19/10/21,i am happy to have found a drink flavor mix that uses the healthier option of stevia tastes pretty good i use it with a fiber mix so it is just fine fiber drinks like metamucil typically have the less healthy sweeteners so i just buy konsyl and mix it with the stevita 
positive,15/6/21,sliced cucumbers and a packet of justin s nut butter natural maple almond butter makes a perfect healthy on the go snack i love it and more importantly my kids love it 
positive,4/8/21,in my attempt to buy healthier snacks that do not have high fructose corn syrup artificial sweeteners and processed sugar i discovered these raw revolution bars they are great we have tried several flavors and love them they are great for on the go snacks and are made with whole ingredients 
positive,4/8/21,other reviewers must have expected these to taste like candy bars which they do not but they are delicious pay no attention to the bad reviews if you like real food my mother and i recently switched over to these instead of other energy bars because they have real ingredients instead of junk and fillers and what a difference they are dense and chewy without being dry and are all in all wonderful 
positive,18/7/21,i really love this stuff i just discovered this from one of those cooking shows on tv and wanted to try it it is difficult to find farro in regular grocery store and not everyone has an italian grocery store close to them it is just really convenient to order from amazon with free shipping it arrived very quickly

positive,15/6/21,not only are these organic purees healthy they are actually pretty tasty our baby devours these on their own or mixed with other foods the packaging is very convenient for meals at home or on the go even my adult palate was pleased with the little taste i had the only potential negative is that they are a little on the pricey side 
positive,4/8/21,these crunchy snacks are healthy addictive and tasty i love the crisp texture the flavors and the perfect size for a snack much better than the apple chips that have all that added junk and sugar these sensible foods snacks are just dried fruit love the apple harvest flavor best then tropical blend a favorite snack item 
positive,25/9/21,this is a good product for the cat s teeth you can get a cat interested in them by a giving them when the cat is hungry and or b breaking them into smaller pieces to they can bite them more easily and to release the enticing poultry smell so they know they are not eating a rock 
positive,19/10/21,it is really tasty and easy to cook and it is less than calorie it is helpful to lose my weight 
positive,4/9/21,the oatmeal raisin bars by quaker are a tasty treat but unlike some bars they are not too sweet or too bland they have enough sweentess to make them flavorful but do not go to extremes they are relatively low in fat content calories fat calories and pretty convenient to have with you if you just want a quick snack but do not want anything too heavy they are also appropriate for any time when you get a little craving for something unhealthy something you might regret something like potato chips or cookies for this reason they are a healthy alternative to junk food i tend to like to eat them for breakfast but they are also an excellent in between meals snack in stores it will cost you about three or four dollars for a pack of i have tried a few of the others kinds made by quaker oats but these are my favorites

positive,4/8/21,i started buying this cereal at the store after reading a recommendation about how much healthier sprouted grains are since it is rather expensive i found that i could save a couple of dollars per box by buying it from amazon to my taste the cereal does not need any added sugar or anything to taste good and i like the consistency too i also buy the almond flavor for variety 
positive,15/6/21,when we lived in louisville we had a fresh market close to us we used to buy crispy green dried fruit there we now live in a state that does not have any fresh markets anywhere and have not been able to find this product in any other store so we always order these off of amazon they are very good for toddlers learning how to chew table food also a healthy snack for everyone and those with an allergy to sulfur such as myself which is found in other dried fruit this is a good option

positive,10/8/18,my son is on a gluten free diet and finding good healthy snacks that fall into that category and that taste good enough for him to eat is very hard he loves these bars he thinks they taste like cocoa krispies and would eat the whole box if he could they are packed full of vitamins and minerals and are organic for those that are concerned about that these bars are on average pretty expensive in the stores but i can purchase them off amazon for much cheaper and i usually buy them in bulk if you have a picky eater or if anyone is on a specific diet these might be something to consider as many know it is hard to find gluten free snack products that taste very similiar to regular ones and these really do make the cut envirokidz organic koala crispy rice bars chocolate count bars pack of

positive,17/7/18,the holistic dog food from bench and field is my dog s favorite the ingredients are excellent and i can pronounce all of them there is good meat content and grains are kept to a minimum there are a couple of fillers in there that i could do without but as far as fillers go they are less objectionable ones the kibbles are small great for small dogs and toy breeds like my tibetan spaniel i learned about this food because they carry it at trader joe s more reviews at my dog blog baddogbaxter com 
positive,16/1/19,as someone who has cooked for her dogs for yrs now i was not too happy to switch back to dry dog food when meat prices soared i had previously given one of my dogs blue buffalo so i knew it was a good quality food most of the time my dogs are eating blue buffalo dry dog food and always gobble it up since i am comparing to the home cooked meals i make i find the dogs drink a lot more water and have more stools which is not fun for clean up otherwise the dogs are maintaining a good weight and their coats look healthy with a supplement of salmon oil each day overall i am satisfied with this product

positive,15/2/20,a dog trainer suggested we switch to grain free dog food for our two dogs the young jack russell mix not picky at all but the elderly shih tzu will sometimes refuse to eat the trainer also suggested we steam the dry food with boiling water so the dogs especially the shih tzu could smell it we have been using this brand for some time now and both dogs love it steaming it produces a bit of a gravy it also softens the food which is helpful for the shih tzu we have tried different types and flavors of dog food in the past but this one is still a huge hit with the dogs they also seem quite healthy and active on it 
positive,22/4/21,i have thouroughly enjoyed preparing and eating this product reasonably priced compared to grocery store prices

positive,1/7/18,this is a great value especially on subscribe and save and keeps well with the re sealable top red quinoa has a great flavor and the color is appealing if you are introducing quinoa to a newbie the protein benefit is nice as well 
positive,10/8/18,i have never had quinoa but i have read and heard enough about it to finally give in and order some this is a lot cheaper than what you would find at whole foods and trader joe s and it is delicious not to mention great for you if you are just getting into quinoa just search for some recipes on google try the quinoa and black bean recipe it is awesome as far as the product goes it is very neatly packaged and prewashed so you do not need to rinse it the pouches are easy to open and close and that is good because you probably will not use all ounces in one sitting the red qunioa looks great in salads with cereal or on it is own 
positive,15/1/20,i was glad to find this for sale on amazon we used to buy another brand of quinoa but we moved and cannot find it in our area everyone in our family loves it cooks just like rice but has it is own flavor and very healthful 
positive,1/9/20,these diet bars are very tasty with a nice flavor of dark chocolate and a pleasant non sticky crunch with grams of protein and grams of fiber to grams of sugar and only calories they offer a much healthier snack option than the typical vending machine choices or even a lot of so called diet products i have successfully used the south beach diet over the past few years both to loose weight and to improve my cholesterol and i have incorporated its principles into the way that i eat all year long like some other programs the first phase of the south beach diet encourages morning and afternoon snacks and allows a dessert in the evening these diet bars are a good choice for anyone on such a program or really for anyone who just feels like having a healthy and tasty snack or light dessert from time to time i liked them and my wife liked them too 
positive,22/7/21,a pretty tasty cereal supposedly healthy and pretty chocolaty cannot feel guilty eating this every morning i am a big fan of the whole mini wheats line and a big fan of chocolate so this really hits the spot in the mornings fyi if you really like chocolate too consider krave thought i am guessing it is not as healthy as mini wheats 
positive,1/7/18,the just tomatoes brand combines nutrition and fresh taste the whole family loves these freeze dried strawberries but of most important note my year old loves these even though she will not eat fresh strawberries they are less messy too we like to take them on the road when we are traveling so we get some fruit in when it is not convenient to eat fresh the other reviews are accurate in their description of texture loss especially in humid climates however the strawberries are still tasty when they are a little chewy in fact i prefer them that way this is one of the few fruits my husband will take in his lunch 
positive,10/8/18,my three year old loves these they always come quickly they are crunchy sweet but not overly sweet and delicious i will be ordering these many more times 
positive,14/5/21,i discovered this at my local grocery store and loved it went looking for it cheaper and found it here was shocked by the poor reviews come on you chose a very healthy whole wheat gnocchi with a very minimal ingredient additive list did you think it would taste as good as the versions loaded with white flour sugar and oils the product cooks very easily and absorbs the delicious flavors of whatever sauce i put over it 
positive,17/10/19,i really like this popcorn and go through it so fast although orville redibacker s smartpop version is better if you are looking for the tradional kettle corn however do not order it it is not as sweet and does not have all that oil that makes the true kettle corn flavor so it may not be what you are looking for 
positive,3/10/21,eat right your type suggested this bean was very good for my bloodtype o i use in chili lb grass fed beef oz tomato juice can aduki adzuki beans drained can white kidney beans eden drained and pkg chili seasoning this bean can also be used in a popular asian smoothie recipe as well as mixed with rice and seasoning cans are bpa free 
positive,15/9/20,i am not intolerant to gluten but i do keep an eye out for healthy snack foods these oat raisin walnut spice bars have an unusual consistency rather like fruit cake but they sure taste better than fruitcake they are not overly sweet and it is actually possible to detect the flavors of oats raisins walnuts and spice mainly cinnamon and they go well with a nice hot cup of tea 
positive,30/8/20,i really like snacks that you do not feel bad about while enjoying the flavor so this one has made it on my list 
positive,1/7/18,i am on a gfcf diet and blood type o diet so i am very limited on what i can eat i first found bone suckin sauce at the fresh market after months of searching for a natural barbeque sauce that tasted good i figured i would give it a try and was pleasently surprised it is delicious now every week i cook grass fed ground beef turkey bacon onions and mix a little sauce in i could eat this dish every day 
positive,10/8/18,acai is one of the most powerful superfoods i take a shot daily and have noticed increased energy levels and improved digestion 
positive,5/12/19,these are tasty snacks that are healthy for you they are a bit pricey unless you buy them on sale and in bulk 
positive,21/10/19,if you want to eat healthy this is it it tastes pretty good but i add a little bit of honey to it and let it soak in milk for about hour before eating it for breakfast 
positive,8/9/20,i thought it was an excellent product and plan on ordering it again a little sooner than i anticipated because some mice got into it i finally decided t poison the mice they had gone too far 
positive,22/9/21,during a recent trip to ireland i got to try muesli i had no idea what it was when i first had it but then when i got back to the states i was so disappointed that i could not find anything like what i had then my friend said she found some in the grocery store and it was this it is almost exactly the same no added preservatives sweeteners or anything it is all natural deliciousness and i found that buying it here saves about over the supermarket i highly recommend it 
positive,2/10/20,my dogs adore these and it is great to give a treat that i know is not full of fillers and chemicals handy bite sized pieces 
positive,25/7/20,these are a great snack when you are on the go unlike most fruit bars they have a bit of fiber in them making them far healthier and longer lasting 
positive,4/7/21,it is a slim packet with mostly tuna meat and not much water make sure you bring a small spoon to get every bits out it was a little hard to use my fingers to eat i bought it primarily for backpacking and hiking it is light weight healthy and fulfilling as a part of my lunch the calorie count is good per packet and the taste is not bad when the body screams for fuel i can also see it being added into rehydrated tvp rehydrated instant refried beans and canned soup etc i also put a few packets in my cubicle in case i get hungry it is a super healthy snack if you prefer savory snack overall i am very happy to have it in my pantry so that i can grab it whenever i need one or two 
positive,11/9/21,this soup is totally delicious i do not even know how to describe it it is just great it has a little zing to it not too spicy though i do not like spicy things and i like it be sure to let it set for a while after you cook it the texture is much smoother after you let it sit 
positive,4/7/21,found these wonderful almonds during christmas time last year went back to the same store and they did not have them so i looked them up on amazon and was pleased to see they are in stock they are a real treat my family and friends love them 
positive,21/9/21,i was feeding my corgi science diet nature s best and merrick puppy food but as he got closer to turning one i needed to get him on adult food it is very important to me to feed him healthy food that has low grain content and a higher protein content the foods he was on were making him have slightly runny stools and i did a lot of research before settling on wellness core my second option is canidae which gets high reviews as well he really likes this food and the pieces are nice sized not too big and not too small so he can choke them down 
positive,11/9/21,there are very few unsalted snacks available for those with salt related high blood pressure my mother looks forward to receiving her monthly supply of cashews always fresh always tasty and always safe for her to eat 
positive,12/10/21,i am not a big health freak and love soda and everything sugary and bad for you but this stuff is incredible many people want to compare this to izze but izze is only compared to the switch s and you can taste the difference in how natural the product is since i bought this to give up soda the fizziness gives your brain a feeling that it is the same unhealthy soda you normally have but the rest of your body will feel the difference it definitely costs a bit more that a pack of soda but compared to naked juice the other delicious juice beverage it is a bargain deal 
positive,11/10/21,my old son loves these as well as all the children i babysit hard to find where i live so i will continue to purchase thru amazon even set up auto delivery great price and fast shipping

positive,20/9/21,since reading some horrid stories about how some pet foods are made when meat by products are listed among the ingredients it is usually from questionable sources gross at best dangerous for the pet at worst i have decided to look for a healthier option i found merrick cat food by chance and was impressed by the list of the ingredients they use here are the ingredients for the flavor grammy s pot pie my cat s favorite chicken chicken broth turkey liver fresh red jacket new potatoes fresh carrots fresh snow peas fresh whole red delicious apples potato starch modified olive oil calcium carbonate potassium chloride tricalcium phosphate cassia gum carrageenan flax seed oil for omega poultry seasoning thyme sage rosemary choline chloride salt taurine mixed tocopherols vitamin e supplement yucca schidigera extract zinc amino acid complex iron amino acid complex manganese amino acid complex vitamin supplement copper amino acid complex d calcium pantothenate vitamin a acetate niacin lecithin vitamin supplement riboflavin supplement folic acid ethylenediamine dihydriodide cobalt glucoheptanate pyridoxine hydrochloride biotin thiamine mononitrate sodium selenite if you pay attention to the first ingredients you will see that there are no meat by products or grains a cheap filler used by many companies that produce dog and cat food my cat really likes this food it comes in many other flavors and she seems to enjoy pretty much all the ones i have offered her what also makes me like this food is that it does smell a lot better that any supermarket pet food the meat flavors smell like meat and the fish ones smell like fish but in a disturbing pungent way also you can see small pieces of vegetables with the meat which my cat also likes and that are good for her sure this food is a little more expensive than other products but all in all it is well worth it a must have your cat will thank you

positive,11/6/21,this company makes all their food with the highest natural ingredients but this limited ingredients one is the best i learned that cats cannot digest carbohydrates so many cats have stomach problems and sensitive stomachs like my kitty i switched my cat over to this food and his stools are firmer and less smelly and he never throws up my cat gobbled up the food right away i highly recommend this

positive,11/6/21,do not be swayed by what some reviewers are saying about annie s natural shells and aged cheddar mac and cheese i almost did not purchase this product because of some of the reviews i read on here but i am glad i did it is not only healthy and fast but actually pretty tasty too if you are expecting something all natural that tastes like kraft you are going to be disappointed kraft s sauce is thicker and sweeter but annie s sauce tastes less processed and has a better all around flavor i prefer the aged cheddar mac and cheese to the white cheddar one which was very bland try adding a little extra butter to enhance the flavor of the sauce 
positive,9/7/21,eat think smile granola clusters cinnamon almond is ounces of good eating healthy yet delicious granola clusters with almonds and cinnamon get the extra treatment of cocoa powder this delicious coating adds antioxidants and taste whole grains give these treats thumbs up for me but all these healthy elements do add up to calories per cup serving perfect for snacking right out of the bag or i would eat them with milk or on top of yogurt although these are definitely vegetarian i do not know if they are vegan as the ingredient list includes sugar and honey the product s website did not disclose that it is in fact vegan so i would assume not i highly recommend this tasty healthy snack 
positive,22/6/21,i adopted my adorable edmund last year from a shelter they sent me home with a small bag of felidae not grain free version cat and kitten formula as he was a kitten at the time i am very concerned about eating healthy whole foods so i of course want the best for my kitty as well i did research and found that cats digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains fruits vegetables directly and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey s stomachs ie if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it so i wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what is found in nature as possible without breaking the bank he already seemed to really like the felidae grain included version so as soon as my starter bag ran out i immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has only eaten this ever since i got him he loves it i give him one small scoop of this grain free kibble in the morning and then a quarter or so of a large felidae grain free can of food we have tried both the turkey chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and edmund prefers the turkey chicken but will of course eat anything i give him he has the absolute softest shiniest fur coat i have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy i have to blame at least some of this on the fact he only eats grain free felidae food the rest is because i love him so ridiculously much i love the free shipping on amazon i buy a case of canned and a bag of dry or of one at the same time i used to buy this elsewhere and since it is so heavy shipping would often be almost as much as the product 
positive,2/8/21,very tasty and fiber rich cereal i ate it cold with soy milk and finished the box off myself i am buying more 
positive,11/6/21,i prefer this almond milk to any other i enjoy the genuine mild almond taste and do not need nor want any sweeteners vanilla flavors or other unnecessary distractions there is no bitterness with this milk like there is with some other major brands very tasty and very healthy mere calories per serving cruelty free too i only take this almond milk i used to buy it in my local store but they discontinued it and i like it so much that i now have to order it on amazon 
positive,8/7/21,this is one of my favorite healthy cereals it has a good mix of textures and the flavors are sweet and indulgent eating it you definitely do not feel like you are eating a health nut cereal i am a huge fan of banana so i really enjoy the distinguishable sweet and fruity flavor they lend the cereal as well as the slight nuttiness from the flax the green tea is really subtle almost undetectable and does not really affect the flavor of the cereal the only downside is that this cereal is a little more calorically dense than some of the other healthy cereals on the market it is calories for cup with grams of fiber and grams of protein while kashi golean cereal ounce boxes pack of has only calories grams of fiber and g of protein in a cup as a result optimum rebound is not as filling and i find myself feeling hungrier faster than i do if i have had kashi golean for breakfast however the flavor of optimum rebound is much sweeter and more complex so understandably you have to sacrefice nutritionals a bit for something that is tastier however it is still much healthier than many mainstream sugary cereals i find myself typically making up the difference by mixing some optimum rebound into my kashi golean for flavor this gives me the best of both words however this is still a great cereal overall and will especially appeal to you if you find cereals like kashi golean to be too bland 
positive,28/9/21,my son insisted that we try this gluten free allie s awesome buchkwheat pancake mix when he visited us recently he made pancakes for us adding fresh organic blueberries served them with real maple syrup very yummy

positive,11/6/21,i like to eat these for breakfast or in between meals for a quick healthy snack i like the almonds and flax included in these bars the texture is really nice a little chewy but a little crunchy there is a good balance of complex carbs and proteins to give me enough energy to get to my next meal these are not too sweet there are no chemicals or artificial ingredients in these give them a try

positive,11/6/21,i love glenny s low fat soy crisps they are delicious healthy and have protein they are a great snack and i keep some in my car when i get hungry in the afternoon they are cheaper to buy in bulk online because in the store you pay over a dollar per bag 
positive,22/10/21,my chocolate lab lizzy is very active even at years old she does eat yogurt but will not eat any vegetables so this is a way for her to get some fruit she really looks forward to these treats they smell great i keep them in a lagre glass container on the kitchen counter and one time had a house guest mistake them for a cookie

positive,30/1/21,this offer is a great price and a great taste thanks amazon for selling this product staral
positive,13/2/21,the variety packs taste great i have them every morning at cents per meal i do not understand why everyone on earth is not buying this stuff up maple and brown sugar is terrific followed by apples and cinnamon followed by regular you do not get tired of the same ole thing and they taste great i just boil water from a small pot empty the packet or in a bowl pour in boiling water and watch it expand to its size taste really good and takes minutes to prepare not sure why everyone on earth is not this convenient healthy very quick excellent quality and extremely cheap 
positive,15/1/21,we really like the mccann s steel cut oats but find we do not cook it up too often this tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenient anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing 
negative,6/3/21,i purchased the mango flavor and to me it does not take like mango at all there is no hint of sweetness and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice i have been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades so i am familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products i have tried the mango flavor is one of the least appealing i have tasted it is not terrible but it is bad enough that i notice the bad taste every sip i take 
positive,8/6/21,these taste really good i have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture i agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer there is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items order in cold weather and buy enough to last 
positive,7/1/21,the mouth says how do i love thee let me count the ways if you like apple products a must have item the only draw back shipping cost these are very heavy 
positive,17/4/21,i have been a fan of hot spicy maruchan ramen for a long time if you enjoy spice and love ramen you will love this product too bad it is way too expensive here on amazon it is only per at my walmart 
positive,10/3/21,i love this flavor of ramen i do not eat other flavors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison for the convenience of having it delivered to my home i have prime so i get it in two days and do not have to pay for the shipping the price on amazon is not bad at all but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store 
positive,14/1/21,the best investment i have ever made for ginger it is unbelievable it is fibrous like the real ginger has that spicy kick to it but it is perfect with the sugar calms it down it is very worth the for of it i will be getting more soon i use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies 
positive,24/5/21,perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket we love it shakes well no clumping and flows freely 
positive,14/10/21, length mins the expiration date is months from the day i bought this product the tuna tomato combination is delicious this is one of the many items i re order on amazon every month or so edit added a short video so you see what this combination looks like i was wearing one of those headlamps but i did not do a good job focusing on the tuna i should film it over but it does not look like many people view this product anyway 
positive,7/2/21,these are the best tasting tuna pack they make in my opinion make a great on the go snack and really satisfying with the tomato
positive,29/3/21,i found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there excellent quality and no need to dress it up i put it the micro on about power for minute and shazam i believe a little heating brings out the flavor 
negative,17/4/21,seriously this product was as tasteless as they come there are much better tasting products out there but at calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack you just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor 
positive,10/3/21,tastes great and gives me energy without the jitters love this product however i do wish it came in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a zip lock pouch because the zip lock ripped off and quit working after awhile but the product is fantastic just not crazy about the packaging 
positive,10/7/21,these mints are really strong and have a great taste they are also a convenient size to carry in a pocket or purse 
positive,27/1/21,i am trying several of the wu yi teas i like this one particularly because of the subtle citrus taste it also has a natural sweetness the ingredients include organic wu li cliff oolong tea mg organic black tea mg organic green tea extract mg proprietary blend mg plus some ginseng panax orange peel lemon grass and guarana other ingredients natual orange and citrus flavors my goal is to drink more tea and less coffee i am enjoying trying a different kind of tea every day i will be coming back to this one 
negative,1/6/21,terrible artificial lemon taste like pledge lemon furniture polish do not do this to yourself just use plain flake salt and some fresh grated lemon zest 
negative,20/8/21,the taste of these white cheddar flat breads is like a regular cracker which is not bad except that i bought them because i wanted a cheese taste what was a huge disappointment how misleading the packaging of the box is the photo on the box i bought these in store makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads expanding the length and width of the box wrong the plastic tray that holds the crackers is about smaller all around leaving you with about or so small flatbreads what is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and eco friendly packaging fail they used a huge box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers not ecofriendly at all would i buy these again no i feel ripped off the other crackers like sesame tarragon give you a little more bang for your buck and have more flavor 
positive,14/8/21,a very delicate green tea with a smooth light taste and an subtle floral tones and no bitter aftertaste in the years we have been drinking ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed the superb quality of ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years i am so happy to find ahmad teas available here thanks amazon because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away the current deal for the pack of is superb much cheaper than i can find locally this is a great tasting tea which i am happy to recommend 
positive,21/4/21,so many healthy products do not taste very good or taste good when you first try them and then go downhill i have had these chips on more than one occasion and they are very tasty i have served them to guests twice and both times they wanted to know what they were and where to get them it is also nice to have something gluten free for friends who are borderline diabetic but i would eat them anyway 
negative,1/4/21,i paid for a ounce pkg of these at lunch today i bought them because brown rice is a good carb as soon as i tasted one and it tasted like a corn chip i checked the ingredients the name is deceptive these have masa corn flour listed in the ingredients and it overwhelms the taste i will not buy these again i can get sunchips for less money and similar taste 
positive,17/4/21,i was looking for a natural energy shot that works and i found it steaz energy shot is my favorite i recently had gastric bypass surgery so tons of sugar is a no no and i am also allergic to sucralose splenda so most other energy drinks are out i tried bazi energy shots and they did not work as well as steaz and definitely did not taste as well these have a taste that is almost like coca cola not bad at all if you are looking for natural energy give these a try 
positive,10/3/21,i first found steaz berry energy shots at a local organic market i bought two bottles which cost just under three dollars each i fell in love instantly the drink is delicious i can taste the yerba mate and the acai juice like a slightly bitter fruity chocolate honey tea i am very sensitive to sucralose splenda which is in so many energy drinks these days i also hate the taste i love that steaz has actual sugar and no artificial sweeteners the rush it gives me is slow and even i have several medical conditions including fibromyalgia which saps me of energy and causes intense pain i like how steaz helps clear away the fatigue and fog so i can get things done no caffeine jitters even though there are mg of caffeine in each bottle it was becoming expensive for me to buy the bottles separately at stores so i started looking online for a bulk price i am so thrilled to have found the pack of on amazon i signed up for amazon prime specifically for this product hah 
positive,22/4/21,i love this coffee i do wish it came already ground as i do not have a grinder and use a blender instead but it is worth it many flavored coffees i have tried only seem to have a flavored odor that does not reach the coffee but this one manages both 
positive,25/4/21,i like a lot of sesame oil and use it in salads regularly great quality flavor and aroma cannot beat that its organic 
positive,1/4/21,this is what i was looking for and was missing it the taste is exactly the taste as the one made in india so just loved it and remember my days back in india definitely recommend it 
positive,30/6/21,i bought this strawberry extract hoping to spruce up a strawberry wine that ended up with less flavor than i would original expected a common problem in some fruit wines this is indeed good strawberry flavor just add to your sugary concoction be it a baking good a dessert or a drink to either give strawberry flavor or add to existing flavor and presto just about everyone will be licking their lips and maybe fingers for those interested i found the right addition to a liquid volume to be oz of extract per gallon of liquid 
positive,1/3/21,this is just fantastic chicken noodle soup the best i have ever eaten with large hearty chunks of chicken and vegetables and nice large noodles this soup is just so full bodied and is seasoned just right i am so glad amazon carries this product i just cannot find it here in vermont 
positive,29/1/21,these nuts arrived fresh and are very tasty they are not broken or dirty looking like cashews sometimes can 
positive,17/4/21,i was surprised about how good this was my family and friends laughed when i told them i bought this but out of the can ready mix with a little salt pepper spinach and some cheese and it is a great easy meal 
positive,10/3/21,the thing about marmite is that those who do not like it hate it and those who love it cannot live without it it is very much an english thing and the language has even adopted the trade name as a metaphor as in victoria beckham is marmite meaning that those who do not like her etc amazon has done the world a favor by making this weird and wonderful stuff available at an affordable price last time i looked it was a jar in british stores in l a county or about what it costs in england the amazon supplier was quick and efficient and i now have enough marmite to last me to the end of the year or would have if i did not decide to send one of the two jars to my son in japan good job amazon 
positive,30/5/21,one of the best chips that you can buy and i have tried all the kettle varieties and many others there is only a slight taste of jalapeno and they are delicious perfect with a sandwich or alone if you like being addicted these are the chip for you see you at addicts anonymous 
positive,28/9/21,these chips have the right amount of crunch and i enjoy the taste chips are consistent and have a fairly even distribution of seasoning i like the oz size bags just the right amount of chips 
positive,6/5/21,it took a while to get used to these chips but they are pretty good and more healthy for you they sure were eaten all up by my family and friends 
positive,20/4/21,fantastic you can not beat this taste and you can not resist to it only one if you are spice lover
positive,20/4/21,i simply fell in love with these chips and refused to share them with my friends my experience with a lot of cheese favored chips has been too salty and a little over the greasy side but these ny cheddar from kettle really changed my mind thanks to amazon for great discounts and i do not have to buy them from the store anymore 
positive,21/4/21,great price for an excellent chip at about cents for a ounce bag these are a bargain as well as a very tasty chip everyone i have let try these has been impressed and commented on how good they taste i have yet to find a kettle chip that disappointed 
negative,2/5/21,i once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy i discovered them when i was in england back in and quickly became a fan about a year ago i picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket i was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it after opening the bag i found the chips were not even close to the kettle chips i was used to they were all uniform whitish yellow in color flavor was way off the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and i was very disappointed so i e mailed kettle with the following what happened i bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste it tastes cheaper i do not know how else to put it i also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as i did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor i am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product did i just get a weird batch i have been buying only kettle chips for about years now so i am wondering i did receive a reply thanks for letting us know about your experience with your kettle brand chips it sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections and we apologize our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color but our chips should still taste great thanks for providing us with the best before code from the bag this really helps when passing on your comments to our staff we are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our kettle brand flavors or nut butters believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase in case you buy this product again we suggest avoiding the same best before date if you still have it in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within weeks please let me know if i can be of any more help well the next bag was good since that time i have picked up bags of chips all were like the bad bag so i am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost i did some research and found out that kettle was bought out by a private equity company so the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at kettle acquire company with high quality brand recognition sell product to mass merchants lower quality cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand stay away from kettle chips they are no longer the same 
positive,18/12/19,i would continue to buy but i am moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars shattered too many they like all the flavors though great textures too

positive,31/3/20,i heard some great things about sassafras and wanted to try it i was worried about the taste but it turned out to be a lot better than i anticipated i am actually going to order the pack and continue drinking it over time do not trust the fda 
negative,18/12/19,i purchased this because i read that it was a natural cure for hives um how about not it did nothing for my hives and it tastes awful luckily a co worker of mine loves this stuff reminds him of his grandmother and i gave it to him yucky yucky stuff 
positive,13/10/19,these are great for at work just pop the instant bag in for a minute then make your coffee this is the best tasting coffee it is easy to make without a mess 
positive,28/9/20,i tried this before having normal red tea so i waited to review the flavor still rings in my head it is earthier than rooibos tea and less frity the color is that of muddy water and it has the grittiness and viscosity of it as well well worth every penny 
positive,16/11/20,my poland spring driver gave us this new tea to try and our family really enjoyed it i looked at the ingredients and was quite pleased with the natural ingredients and no calories 
positive,27/2/20,this is my favorite hot sauce i buy it locally and love the flavor that they all have hopefully the other flavors will show up on amazon for people to enjoy my favorites are the medium and pineapple flavored ones so far thank you for making a flavorful hot sauce 
positive,26/2/21,this is the first time i have used the coconut oil from manila coco factory and i was so pleased with the taste smell and overall incredible quality that i will buy more and recommend it to my family and friends i am so glad i tried it i have been using coconut oil for several years and it has changed my life and health this oil ranks high in my book also i liked ordering this product through amazon because they make it fast easy and painless thank you for having this product on your site amazon 
positive,18/12/19,these are identical to jay s hot chips are they made by the same company they have a slightly sweet taste with a nice bit of heat definately not overwhelming heat on a heat scale of i would give these about a regarding the texture these are not kettle cooked chips so they do not have much crunch they are comparable to regular lays chips for about a bag they are a great deal 
positive,19/1/20,i first had these uncle ray s chips a few years ago while traveling out west i tracked them down on amazon and recognized the name they are just as good as i remember smoky sweet with just enough kick and there is adequate seasoning on all of the chips each bag also has a little story courtesy of uncle ray that usually has some moral message or anecdote they are pretty funny but not intentionally my only problem with these chips is their texture they are a bit thin and there is not much of a crunchy texture otherwise these are good chips and well worth trying out 
negative,13/9/20,we have ordered uncle rays bbq chips many times before always been pleased except this order just not the same seasoning as usual generally lacked much for taste not sure if they have reduced the seasoning in their processing but out of case we bought we have opened and thrown away bags already very disappointed with this order 
negative,10/7/20,i have loved ketchup flavored potato chips since i was a kid and spent my summers at my grandparents in canada this is a very popular flavor there and seems to be always available i recently got back from a trip to montreal where i ate at least a pack a day i decided i really wanted some around and was happy when i found these on amazon unfortunately the flavor is nowhere close to the brands i have tried before there is a sort of smoky barbeque sauce thing going on not that they are as good as bbq potato chips which i love they just do not taste like ketchup i tried to get through a bag over a couple of weeks to see if they would grow on me then just threw them all out yuck 
positive,14/4/21,if you are looking at choice tea you are probably already aware that this extraordinary company was a pioneer in the use of organic fair trade ingredients for tea but choice is also innovative both in design and in creative ingredient combinations as for design lychee white is part of choice s new line characterized by an innovative biodegradable pyramid shaped tea bag which allows for the use of regular loose tea leaves as for creative ingredient combinations this healthy white tea is enhanced by the ethereal marriage of natural lychee flavor and sublime organic osmanthus blossoms the flavor and scent is one to savor and celebrate 
positive,24/4/21,i prefer the taste of this over the alcohol based vanilla extracts particularly in uncooked items and beverages it has a fairly thick syrupy consistency 
positive,28/4/21,raw organic fair trade tastes great what is not to love my hope is that as more people buy their amazing chocolates that the price will come down a bit 
positive,12/7/21,being the candy lover that i am i wanted to buy some cute lollipops that i could pull out of my bag and enjoy whenever i felt like it for that purpose alone i would give them five stars however at first lick the lollipop has a slightly off taste but this goes away after a minute and is not unbearable or disgusting in any way i laughed quite a bit at the reviews of outraged individuals because the lollipops are made in china i am not dead dying sick good enough as well the text on the wrapper is fine i was not repulsed by it and i am not afraid to share i would only rewrap them if they were for presentation rather than eating the colors are not as vivid as in the picture and the lolipops are not glazed so they do not have that shiny look that many others have none of mine came broken and they were well wrapped i am happy with my purchase and plan on eating them all minus the few that i share with friends but i would try something different next time 
positive,18/12/19,i was surprised at the size of these potatoes i have bought them at my local grocery store before and was disappointed that they were so small these are perfect tasty cook just right love them 
positive,19/1/20,excellent and tasty though i thought not enough garlic so i added more when i order garlic i guess i expect more of it but perfect if you have guests as it will never offend anyone omaha always is sure to do everything to please their customers a premier company hard to find anymore 
positive,28/4/21,i like them but nothing unique about the flavor basically saves you from having to make them at home a little pricey but for a treat what the heck
positive,8/8/20,this tea is so helpful for congestion and it tastes great too make sure you let it steep as long as the directions say it really seems to help you to feel better 
negative,22/5/21,i bought this for my husband since he loves ranch he uses ranch dressing with everything before i bought it i read a review that said it taste good inspite of the fat free well my husband had it and says it is aweful i guess to each his own everyone is tastebuds are not alike someone else may like it so i am not going to discourage anyone from trying it however i had to cancel my subscription because the only one that likes ranch in the family does not like this one i guess he needs the fat 
positive,18/12/19,i love these wild cherry tic tacs and they are impossible to find in stores i am so glad that i can get them from amazon and the price is excellent they are a great low calorie treat and i will keep buying them from amazon highly recommend this purchase 
positive,19/1/20,i have recently been on a low carb diet as i find that i can no longer tolerate even natural sugars like agave honey and dates these raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin a hormone whose message is store fat insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore i would bloat from a high carb diet my dilemma is that i love sweets and now it is not a problem thanks to products like stevia a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years it has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar although for some people there might be a bit as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar stevia used to be legal in the usa only as a cosmetic product because of politics companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition yet aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis so i would use stevia at times but the aftertaste was bad and to be honest i was not too crazy about the during taste either then i tried nunaturals this product is awesome and like no other stevia i have tried it is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste unless you put in way too much a common mistake by people new to this it comes in tablets and in powdered form in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings it also comes in alcohol free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor unlike aspartame which becomes even more toxic when heated stevia can be used in baking nunaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that since i am a raw fooder i cannot tell you how it tastes but i am sure it is good judging by their other products thanks to these great products i can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets 
positive,3/8/20,this is the best tasting stevia powder i have tried most other powders have a weird after taste but this one does not i recently bought a bag of it online and i am making my way through it 
positive,29/7/21,this has been the best tasting stevia i have tried i also think this is a better value than some of the others i really like not having to open all the packets when i make a gallon of tea 
positive,8/7/20,i bought the nunaturals white stevia with maltodextrin several months ago as i am trying to cut back on sugar and artificial sweeteners the first morning i tried it in my coffee and hated it it tastes just as bitter as equal or sweet n low i decided to give it another try that same day in my lemonade and it was absolutely delicious i have also tried it in hot tea and it is bitter but wonderful in iced tea so i think hot drinks bring out the bitterness in stevia all in all i am glad i bought this and also a box of the packets which are very convenient on the go i have tried many different brands of stevia but so far this is the only one i have not thrown out i also tried truvia not a fan it makes your coffee or tea taste like licorice 
positive,13/4/21,if you are trying to get off sugar this is the product for you i has a great sweet taste without spiking your insulin and no bitter aftertaste great for diabetics and anyone trying to eat healthy i love this product 
positive,20/2/21,i have tried various brands of stevia but i always come back to nunaturals i buy the ounce container because i use it to sweeten everything if you have a sweet tooth as i do but do not need the added pounds then this is the ticket for you i drink a lot of tea and this is my sweetener a lot of other stevia brands leave a bitter after taste but this is the best that i have found to resolve that problem highly recommended 
positive,9/12/20,i was looking for a healthier alternative to splenda and equal nustevia taste great and this container lasts a long time 
positive,1/4/21,i discovered this product a couple of years ago and really liked the taste in coffee tea and on fruit and oatmeal it was a lot less expensive in the packets then but i have switched to the large oz container and the price is very good i do not use sugar and this helps me have the sweet and not the increased blood sugar yeah 
positive,25/2/21,love this on a toasted bagel with cream cheese and scallions or even dill great way to enjoy caviar and not break the bank 
negative,18/12/19,this stuff sounded perfect way too much red dye and no taste according to me and my friends who tried it kind of salty basically i would stay away from it i am tempted to toss it out but paid too much to feel right about it 
positive,19/1/20,forget starbucks peets or anything else this is the real deal like a good vintage wine britt coffee is truly gourmet with no after taste i am really fussy about coffee and generally avoid it but after a trip to costa rica fell in love with the beverage again you have to use a french press to get the full favor so throw away those other coffee making contraptions your beans deserve the best your taste buds deserve the best too no i do not work for britt and did not get paid to say this but if you guys at britt read this send me a sample or two 
positive,14/10/20,great tasting coffiee one of the best i have ever had the problem here is the high shipping costs 
positive,10/3/21,these radiation treated dinners that do not need freezing are a great convenience i have tried quite a few of the hormel compleats and this is one of my favorites home cookin it are not and it is a bit too salty but for a satisfying meal in seconds it is hard to beat the only reason i have given this flavorful decently chicken filled dish stars instead of is because the rice is white we all know by now that whole grains are healthier so until these companies start making their dishes with whole wheat pasta and brown rice i will mark them down 
positive,15/8/21,if you want a hot meal with no effort that is delious this is the way while cooking noodles microwave left over meat hot dog boloni sp also microwave a spoon or two of vegetable left over frozen canned after noodles cook add season packet pour over meat veg after a minute pour some of the liquid out you have a wonderful meal with less sodium because you poured it out college kids live off this meal because it is cheap quick and can all be done in microwave if need be you can get a case of libby s carot peas from amazon for about since you are using only a spoon or two lasts a long time 
positive,27/4/21,sure i could have gone on a food crusade at the local grocery to find a similar product but i do not think i would have found a product as good and tasty as dr mcdougall the noodles are quick and easy to prepare and above all else tasty enough to satisfy my appetite i was surprised that there were enough peanuts in every bite just like at a thai food restaurant overall i am pleased with my order and the quality of the product 
positive,24/1/21,these jelly beans are wonderful they are smaller than regular jelly beans but that does not take away the flavor i would recommand these to anyone 
positive,14/7/20,just a quick note a very good friend of mine who also battles weight issues and love pasta turned me on to this product we bought a box at whole foods and i was impressed by the taste but especially by the low calories and high fiber content amazingly it is about cheaper at amazon than at whole foods and being an amazon prime customer saved me on shipping i will be back for more soon i love quality and a bargain 
positive,5/6/21,i am on a low carb diet and have lost pounds i was so tired of eating meat all the time but too nervous to splurge on pasta until i came across this product on amazon i cook it a minute or two longer than the directions and top it with full fat greek yogurt and parm cheese and one serving is so filling and yummy definitely cures my cravings and am now on subscribe and save my hubby and son love it too 
positive,9/7/21,so many different flavors to choose from i ordered this brand for the first time and the taste is wonderful it was the only decaf french vanilla i could find i have decided to switch from my old brand to this one 
positive,5/6/21,provided you use clean preferably purified water to cook this it can be a great tasting hold over to a main meal far superior to most instant noodle packages out there and for the most part gluten and meat free except for the shrimp flavor while some people have remarked on the over sized packaging this actually allows for a good and thorough mixing of the flavor packets and noodles with little chance of spillage while the coconut ginger variety tastes good it may be a bit too subtle for those looking for an actual taste of thai i would recommend the thai peanut noodles for those seeking something with a bit more of a pronounced thai flavor and highly recommend the a taste of thai peanut salad dressing added to salads meats or the peanut noodles for a very spicy thai experience overall for the taste and quantity the subscribe and save offer provides the best deal comparatively speaking in terms of price wal mart offers most of these noodles a few cents cheaper compared to the subscription price but do not seem to carry the coconut ginger variety at least not at the store near me if you have not tried this brand of instant noodles yet i think you will be in for a treat 
positive,25/7/21,i really like this soup it is mild and i do not like anything that is to hot it is just right has a good flavor and is something i can take to work and pop in the microwave i would buy it again and again 
positive,13/7/21,the thai coconut ginger noodles are quick and easy to prepare you will be rewarded with delicious noodles to enjoy by yourself or share as a side dish with another noodle enjoyer 
negative,9/7/21,i tried these as i love thai food ginger and coconut that was my problem as this mess does not even vaguely resemble thai food and has no discernible ginger or coconut taste plus the noodles stick together even when prepared as suggested and come out in a big clump when you try to eat them also the nutrition label is misleading i am dieting and read labels very carefully this says a serving is one cup and also says one package weighs half a cup i figured as it did not say otherwise and as this type of meal is usually one serving that after adding water there would be one serving per package not so one package is actually two servings or over calories this is far more than any other pre packaged noodle meal i have seen the excessive calorie content might have been ok had the product tasted good but it does not i would definitely recommend you stay away from this mess 
positive,8/7/21,while the restaurants always do it best these curry pastes are pretty tasty it is easy to use fast and you can add the meat and veggies of your choice for those of you scared of something spicy you might use a little less but for most it is just right and for those that like it spicier you can add a little crushed red pepper since the coconut milk has to be added separately you can also control the fat content you can go light or go with the much yummier creamy stuff i find the green curry is a little sweeter than the red and panang curries and is maybe a little less spicy 
positive,15/7/21,i just ordered this came today and thought i would just try it well to my amazement my little daisy ate it and wanted more my little dog is just yrs but has trouble with flare ups with her pancreas i have to avoid fats and corn with her and she needs more fiber i have been making her dog food but she missed eating the dry i wondered if it was small enough for her to chew but it was 
positive,6/7/21,everyone should know this is a healthier dog food than walmart brands like purina iams or god forbid moist meaty ingredients like ground flax seed peas whole carrots whole sweet potatoes apples blueberries and probiotics and the lack of sweeteners by products and low quality corn show this to be true i just did a taste test with this harmonic farms and my dogs old iams proactive health and decided to make the results known i let him smell both thoroughly without letting him eat at first and placed the two piles a bit apart he immediately went for the harmonic farms finished it and did not even look at the iams before coming back to me wagging his tail hoping for more dogadvisor com made me aware of my past mistakes in dog food choices and i was hoping to god he would not shy away from the healthy organic stuff like i do to my great welcome surprise he did not i guess he is a hippie at heart i on the other hand will take my nachos bell grande 
positive,13/8/21,these tastes good if it is not fried not bad for you and tastes good then why not eat them of course not a lot at once but these are great healthier snacks 
positive,5/6/21,a while ago i got a bag of the bbq at a store to go with my lunch and i loved these so when i was searching amazon and found these on subscribe and save i knew that this was something that i had to have for my lunches i love the fact you get all the different flavors and as of yet i have not found a flavor i did not like being from england i am very picky about my flavors of chips or crisps as i would call them as there seems to be such limited flavors but this box gives me flavors i cannot complain i also love the fact that fat is the fat content which just makes them an even better snack my only issue now is that i have to fight my husband and son over them because they love them just as much as i do i have now had to go to a box a month but even then i am not sure i can have enough for the month with the three of us eating them every chance we can 
positive,9/7/21,good flavorful chips too bad the selection does not include jalape ntilde o or paramsan garlic packaging is difficult to open but they fresh 
positive,17/6/21,these are really good tasting chips they are not too unhealthy so you can eat a fair amount love the flavoring 
positive,31/8/21,these really are good i gave some to other people and they liked them too the plain flavored ones take well to using them as scoops for your own dip or salsa when eating the bbq flavored ones brings back memories of yester years when i would eat bbq pork skins while riding in the back of the truck on the range i think the pepper ones could use more pepper but they are all still good and make a good snack or side dish to lunch at cal per pack 
positive,7/8/21,i bought these when they were on a gold box deal thinking that it would be a nice inexpensive toss in for a month of lunches and then i would never buy them again not so they are actually really tasty exceptionally crunchy and the flavor is similar to kettle cooked chips definitely going on subscribe and save for a while i do not think they are any more salty than standard potato chips but they are by no means low salt 
positive,6/9/21,popchips do not taste like a lot of the other lowfat salty snack options they are light in taste and big on crunch great alternative to potato chips i am not a fan of the bbq flavor but i do like the sea salt vinegar salt pepper alot and sour cream and onion like the individual bags perfect for on the go and lunches 
positive,5/6/21,these are better than any low calorie chips i have ever had and i prefer them to normal chips they are wonderful oprah even loves them i would buy this box again and probably will because i love that these are calorie packs the barbeque and salt and vinegar ones are awesome 
positive,9/7/21,these taste wonderful guilt free if you can stop at one bag will definitly buy again 
positive,19/6/21,what is to say pop chips are great kudos to the pop chip makers 
positive,5/9/21,i really liked these chips they came recommended from my friend and i really like them the variety pack is great to try all of the flavors although there were some i was not so fond of the cheddar bbq and salt pepper chips are great the traditional ones are get this traditional no excitement there the chips are great my brother still asks if i have any around the house but i have not yet purchased them again hint the have the texture of the snack munchos 
positive,10/10/21,i love popchips the bag now has only calories and it bit smaller but if you are craving pop chips without the fat and still taste great these are for you a bit pricey but worth it 
negative,29/9/21,i have heard about these chips for a while now and thought they would be a good alternative to regular chips i could not eat them though they just do not taste good to me personally my grandmother loved them though and i gave the rest to her 
positive,11/9/21,we love popchips but they are hard to find at our local grocery stores i was very excited to find this variety pack which has flavors some of which we would never tried before in single serve packages right around calories a piece our favorites were the original sea salt vinegar and sour cream onion but all of the flavors were good these were perfect for snacks but they also made for easy lunches we will definitely order again 
negative,5/6/21,i love amazon and i love the reviews from people i have been introduced to alot of great products b c of the reviews but this time total complete let down popchips having stars is just down right perplexing the should not get more than a but generally i sorta want to give it a but the packaging is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing so i through in the extra point i ordered these thinking that would they would be maybe a slightly better version of baked lays man was i wrong i have tried most of the baked lays flavors my go to s at first were original baked lays and sour cream baked lays since those are my favorite regular lays but then i discovered bbq baked lays and seriously those are fantastically great bbq baked lays are packed with so much flavor these popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips literally they do because they are not as good as baked lays i can definitely see eating much less of them which could be a benefit but i say just use portion control and zip lock bag a bunch of baked lays i am trying to think of ways to go into more detail but there is really not much more i can say summary how do popchips taste like slightly burnt air chips it is sort of a weird taste takes alot of getting used to would i suggest buying them no if you are eager to try them i say buy a bag from your local grocery store a week or so after i ordered these on here i saw them at m local krogers so they are definitely expanding nutrition information bag oz calories total fat sodium mg total carbohydrate dietary fiber g sugar protein g vitamin a vitamin c calcium and iron if you buy a big bag of bbq popchips and big bag of bbq baked lays here are the nutrition information side by side pop chips serving size about chips calories total fat sodium total carbohydrate dietary fiber sugars protein baked lays serving size about chips calories total fat sodium potassium total carbohydrate dietary fiber sugars protein vitamin c calcium so these two are very close but baked lays wins because it virtually has not sodium since potassium offsets the sodium leaving of potassium plus there is more fiber and more vitamin c and most importantly they taste better i for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that baked lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit at the end of the day make a decision for yourself but i would strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both baked lays and popchips i can almost guarantee you that baked lays will win hands down hopefully amazon starts selling well priced variety single serve bags of baked lays soon for now i found one from a seller but the price seems a little high but there are bags instead of smart mix variety pack count baked lay s classic baked cheetos baked ruffles baked doritos nachos cheese rold gold tiny twists pack of 
negative,9/7/21,these chips taste average and they are insanely expensive compare to the big bags of chips from safeway or costco for you can get a big bag with times the amount of chips compare to these bag chips so for in safeway you can get worth of popchips these bags are so tiny it is like serve size for fat people trying to lose weigh or something for me i never gain weigh i rather go buy big bag of chips these are expensive ripoff chips will never buy again maybe i think the price is high because i bought it from amazon com maybe elsewhere is cheaper but chips as junk food should not be that expensive compare to local stores 
positive,26/8/21,these are great because they are only calories per pack and are just as good if not better than other chips out there the original style taste exactly like munchos but do not come with the high calorie count the other flavors sour cream onion salt vinegar salt pepper cheddar and bbq are all delicious as well 
positive,26/7/21,i am potato chip addicted i do not only enjoy potato chips but i also enjoy any type of potato product this product really hit the mark for me i consider these a full fledged snack each bag is packed with chips they are moderately seasoned and full of flavor the consistency is slightly like a popcorn cake but they are crisp and crunchy not puffy they have a distinct potato taste the best part each bag clocks in at only calories and i repeat these are not a simple calorie snack what you get here is a full bag of chips what is great about the content vs calorie content is that these are perfect to accompany your lunch without feeling guilty about eating a calorie bag of chips my personal favorites were the sea salt and vinegar and the original the barbecue flavor is sweet not smoky the salt and pepper cheddar and sour cream and onion flavors are standard fair but the chips are adequately and evenly seasoned and i did not notice differences in seasoning from one chip to the next these are a great product well manufactured and a treat to eat i will definitely buy more of these in the future 
positive,11/9/21,this does not taste as addicting as the real fried potato chips but it is still very good considering it is low in calories and it is only popped it taste much better than the ones that are freeze dried these pops taste as light as the rice crispy treats but with a good amount of flavor and crunch i like it a small little pack that you can just grab when you feel like having something quick i keep then in my room in case if i ever get the cravings for chips all the flavors that come in are good too no complains the package also arrived fast and it is pretty cheap i would recommend people who is watching calories to get this 
positive,11/9/21,i love popchips they may take some time getting used to if you are used to the oiliness of potato chips but they are only calories per bag buying a pack saves you money per bag but you are sooo tempted to eat them with so many bags around 
positive,15/9/21,i am very picky when it comes to chips i have gone through so many but this one really hits the spot it has just the right amount of crunch with just the right amount of flavor it is also great to know that you are not eating something that is bad for you with calories a pack it is definitely the ideal snack 
positive,5/6/21,i have subscribed these chips they are so tasty not dry or oily cannot put it down once open a bag and have to have two bags in a row 
negative,9/7/21,this product was a complete disappointment tastes like mushy pineapple there was no papaya taste 
positive,14/9/21,the flavor of this natural sea salt is more nuanced and a bit richer than the typical table salt we are all accustomed to although describing such subtleties is difficult one noteworthy fact is that this salt contains less sodium than conventional table salt per teaspoon versus per teaspoon of conventional table salt another thing to keep in mind is that this natural salt is not iodized as our thyroid glands require trace amounts of iodine it may not be wise to entirely eliminate iodized salt from your diet 
positive,29/9/21,this is the best tasting pancake mix in the market and it is so easy to make 
positive,10/7/21,this waffle and pancake mix is delicious you can taste a subtle hint of vanilla in them they are the only pancakes waffles that my kids love and the house smells wonderful when they are cooking 
positive,1/3/20,this is a great mix i mixed it with milk instead of water just follow the directions 
positive,28/7/20,we are into our third can of this flavorful and easy mix and it just seems to get better and better sunday is pancake day at our house and today we had blueberry pancakes with real maple syrup this mix holds fresh blueberries nicely do not over mix the ingredients and you will get nice fluffy fruit filled or not pancakes that are absolutely first rate 
positive,28/7/20,the pancakes were delicious but they were not as fluffy as the ones i normally make next time i use this i am going to whip the egg whites and see if that helps 
negative,10/11/19,this expensive pancake mix tastes so processed and fake a less expensive bisquick from your local grocery store beats the taste no doubt it is a yucky product 
negative,1/3/20,we did not care for this product at all it seemed to have a funny after taste to it was not worth the cost we were unable to even finish using what we purchased it was that nasty 
positive,3/8/19,i have bought them many times good quality and good taste baby love it and i love it too reccommend it 
positive,6/2/21,my year old son does really like these andthey certainly taste better than some of the other finger food snacks the only issue is there are lots of crumbs in the can they come in so it gets messy if you want to dump them into a baggie for on the go 
positive,24/2/21,these are a great alternative to chips i was not sure how they would be based on other reviews but i am glad i bought them and wish i would of found them sooner i have twin month olds and they cannot get enough of them i like them too 
positive,13/5/21,i purchased this at my local health food store and i am enjoying it immensely the juice has a nice robust texture and it is not overly salty the flavor is amazingly fresh and refreshing i combine it with odwalla flash pasteurized carrot juice for a well above average vegetable juice that is a good energy booster and makes for a great alternative to orange juice or other sweet juices enjoy 
positive,1/3/20,i discovered these when my daughter was about months old i wish i had found them earlier they are organic taste great are easy for toddlers to handle and very convenient i always keep some in my purse and in the car when we are out and about they are not messy unless of course they decide to squeeze the pouch which only happens for us when she is not hungry the plum organics line also includes some varieties with fruits and vegetables mixed together they taste surprisingly good and are one way to get my picky eater to eat some veggies you can find some varieties at reasonable prices on amazon others are more expensive for some reason babies r us has had a sale every other month or so where you can get them for each if you buy them in sets of that is usually when i stock up for the next two months 
positive,28/7/20,not as tasty as the strawberry but still very nice great to throw in a diaper bag or purse spendy but definitely a good deal when it is on sale 
positive,13/5/20,this tea is very good i discovered it while visiting in california the moment i got home i searched local stores for it and i was not able to find it finally i decided to see if amazon had it and they did and i bought two boxes as long as they make it i will buy it 
positive,26/3/21,you just cannot beat the taste of the original dubble bubble gumballs it really does not matter that the taste only last a minute or so but that is why i bought the tub the tub by the way is very convenient and was shipped to me in a condition if your longing for the classic taste go for it you will not be dissappointed 
negative,29/8/19,holy cow i have never seen this much grease in a boxed product like this also it has enough salt to kill an entire family of slugs use it in your garden do not eat it 
positive,7/2/21,a nearby fresh and easy neighborhood market stocks a number of gourmet imported products and i enjoy trying them one is a variety of baxters soups from canada today i had the butternut squash and red pepper soup quite good smooth and mellow mild taste but delicious goes down real easy and it only comes to calories per serving servings per can alas the sodium content is a bit higher than i like otherwise very good gary peterson
negative,14/10/21,i purchased this item to celebrate the birth of my grandson i should have opted for real cigars they might have tasted better these cigars were very hard and hurt my teeth to chew not to mention that these gum cigars were much too sweet 
positive,7/8/20,as a person who love cinnamon scent and flavor i find this tea amazing i was used to drinking the plain black tea at work and this blend is a nice change from that i can probably only have one or two cups a day because it is pretty sweet but i will continue to drink it probably every day enjoy
positive,1/3/20,i love this tea which has a deep cinnamon aroma and taste it is equally good as an iced tea full marks 
positive,28/7/20,i was actually surprised at how good these muffins taste i have reordered a case and they are gluten free 
positive,14/9/21,although i have only been able to try three of caribou s k cup blends mahogany as well as caribou coffee caribou blend k cup portion pack for keurig k cup brewers count and caribou coffee daybreak morning blend k cup portion pack for keurig k cup brewers count i have found that caribou consistently produces the highest quality k cups they are head and shoulders above their competitors like green mountain and van houtte i should mention that caribou s daybreak blend is far and away my favorite k cup flavor of the or so i have been able to sample so far but i enjoy a flavorful medium roast my boyfriend on the other hand prefers an extra bold dark roast after our favorable experience with the caribou brand before we picked up a box of this coffee and hoped that it would be a great choice for a dark blend let me just say that mahogany is full of smokey delicious flavor it is quite strong and dark but there is no rancid bitterness or acidity that accompanies a lot of the dark roasts this coffee packs a powerful punch although that is not normally my thing i can enjoy a cup of this with milk and a bit of sweetener my boyfriend adores it though and it has become a staple blend for him i will still drink this on occasion but it is a bit too potent for me i think this is the best dark roast i have had the chance to try 
positive,17/12/20,i like the taste of this coffee tried the other brands but got stuck on this one i also like the eco friendliness of the company 
positive,2/5/20,strong smooth velvety flavor mahogany describes the color and the mood you get when drinking absolutely the best i have found my favorite 
positive,14/7/21,i like strong coffee but i do not want it to taste burnt or have an acidic after taste caribou coffee s mahogany is full bodied with a nice balance of dark notes and acidity it is one of my go to coffees when my favorites like coffee people s wake up call are out of stock 
positive,18/7/19,i like my coffee strong this is the first brand that i have tasted that provides the kick i need without the bitterness i keep my pantry stocked with mahogony and i do not share 
positive,1/3/20,i happen to like foods that are not as sweet as kool aid or other sugary drinks very refreshing after mowing the lawn and helped keep those afternoon headaches away 
positive,28/7/20,i saw this item in my local grocery store and i thought i would give it a try i have to admit i was very surprised about how much i enjoyed this item i found it refreshing and i felt that i had a bit more energy i would happily purchase this product again and again a word of advice to people complaining that it does not taste coconutty enough coconut water and coconut milk are two very different things coconut water comes from a green immature coconut while the milk comes from what we all think of when we think of a coconut a hard brown fiber covered she will just like a green banana and a ripe banana taste different the same can be said of coconut if you do not think of this as a coconut drink or a pina colada you will probably enjoy it even more 
positive,13/6/20,i decided to try this although i am not a big fan of flavored waters it is quite refreshing and the flavors are quite vibrant and not weak as in some concoctions i happen to like both coconut and pineapple so there is no problem with the basic idea and both can be distinguished in the mix the one drawback for some is because pineapple is a rather strong addition even a splash puts it up front and center this added to the coconut may make it far too sweet for some it would certainly be a good pick me up after a workout or in my case after shoeveling the snow that seems to be deposited regularly this winter in the northeast 
positive,10/3/20,this seems like a pretty straightforward drink it is coconut juice and it is pineapple juice with a bit of sugar and not much else they claim it is a good source of potassium and electrolytes for me it was pretty tasty granted it was also very sweet is it a health drink i do not know if i would go that far it has vitamin c and trace amounts of calcium iron but not much else other than sugar for what it is something sweet to sip it is pretty good 
negative,9/5/20,i am usually into pineapple and coconut drinks but this drink just did not taste all that great to me the taste does not resemble anything close to a pina colada flavor and it was actually difficult to taste the pineapple or coconut in it it just tastes tangy and a little sour like water that has a bit of sugar and sour ness to it yeah not really a taste i crave i am not sure if everyone had this reaction to this drink but it just did not appeal to me i really wanted to like it though because as i said before i usually love pineapple coconut drinks 
positive,14/5/19,this is really delicious and not something you can find in the local grocery store if you did it would be very expensive and a much smaller quantity this is a good deal and super easy to use 
positive,19/10/20, mrs may s dry roasted snack pumpkin crunch ounce pouches pack of pumpkin crunch is great stick with size servings much too easy to consume entire bag without realizing it d lol
positive,1/3/20,i picked up a box of this in a discount grocery store in paso robles the cake was heavenly i liked it so much i found another store that sold the mix as well as the icing and there is even a pink lemonade cookie mix which i bought but have not tried yet the taste is of course lemon but it reminds me a bit of that flavored mix country time i drank as a kid but less tangy its very light and refreshing i simply loved it hope this is more than just a seasonal flavor 
positive,28/7/20,no doubt about it this is just the right combination of lobster scampi prawns with a hint of dry white wine a dash of brandy finish this soup to perfection ingredients water lobster cod scampi concentrated tomato paste modified cornflour white wine prawns skimmed milk powder butterfat double cream salt yeast extract sugar shrimp powder fish powder vegetable oil vegetable extracts stabiliser polyphosphates brandy concentrated lemon juice spices herb and spice extracts with celery no artificial colours no artificial flavours no artificial preservatives information gluten free contains milk fish shellfish celery 
negative,7/3/20,the taste is good but i found myself biting down on small bits of lobster shells more often than acceptable this made me not want to finish my bowl of soup 
negative,4/8/20,this is one of the worse tasting soups i have ever eaten i hated it and now i have a full case it tastes bitter to me and my husband would not even try it only my cat was trying to reach it on the counter 
negative,26/12/19,given the recent issues with products made in china i have decided to not buy any food products from there so i will not be buying anymore of this snack if they ever switch to made in the you s i will buy it again as i did like it 
positive,28/3/21,if you like nuts and you are looking for a healthy great tasting snack you cannot go wrong with almond crunch my husband and i recently eliminated high fructose corn syrup and partially hydrogenated soybean oil from our diet and we feel so much better trying to find tasty snacks that do not contain these products is not easy so we were thrilled to find mrs mays naturals we love the cashew crunch as well 
positive,6/2/20,the nuts used tasted very fresh the bite sized chunks were just right it is lightly sweetened but not too sweet very satisfying 
negative,25/4/21,i used to buy these as healthy snacks at my office cafeteria and consider it better than a bag of potato chips these taste very crunchy and tasty given the kind of unethical food stories we read about china we need to see some kind of assurance and facts on the processes that the manufacturer is following to make these you just cannot import food stuff and sell in the us as gourmet snack food there needs to be data backing this few example of chinese food yuk melamine kind of platic in baby food and milk so wide spread that of milk in china contained this plastic in honey contaminated with ciprofloxacin antibiotic because of which it was banned in the us soy sauce made from human hair not joking google it if you want spurious drugs exported to african countries need some good facts and quality controls from the manufacturers that the chinese producers are complying with some good quality controls 
positive,3/8/20,so i usually consider pasta to be pasta to be pasta it is usually all the same to me however when i tried this brand of pasta i noticed that it does taste better i cannot describe how exactly but it does i thought maybe it was my imagination maybe knowing it is organic was influencing my judgment but my sister commented on it when i served it for her one day she wanted to know where i got it it tasted so good hmmm so while usually there is not much of a taste difference when it comes to noodles and pasta for this brand there is it is subtle but it is there when we moved from california i discovered they did not sell it in the stores here in ny so i was elated when i found amazon carries it elated over a simple pasta yes that is how good it is in comparison mmmmmm mmmmm 
positive,15/4/19,i have long searched for a great linguine and spagetti and this is it just made linguine with clam sauce and each time my husband remarks how terrific it is i buy in packages of for both spagetti and linguine and will reorder when close to being out 
negative,9/3/18,chips ahoy cookies were not very tasty my children and husband would not eat them i tried to give them away and everyone refused 
negative,18/5/18,sent this as a gift and found out later that many items were stale they loved the thought though and loved the way it looked 
positive,9/3/18,absolutely delicious have tried it on everything from meat and fish to scrambled eggs highly recommend it
positive,27/2/18,i found this stuff to be very tasty great with jasmine rice or just as a snack i do not mind a little message if it enhances the flavor 
negative,20/2/18,my local walmart and target both have this ground or whole bean at a regular price of less than per oz bag it is way overpriced here it is an excellent coffee i am drinking it as i write this an interesting hint of woody creamy citrusy taste that is dark but without the burnt aftertaste that comes with many dark roasts 
positive,22/3/18,this is my family s favorite brand of wheat free gluten free cake mix this brand is moist tasty and closer to the traditional cake mixes people are used to namaste products are the best in my opinion of what is available out there in health food stores try it you will not be disappointed 
positive,12/3/18,i used this mix to make a cake in a glass pan using grapeseed oil spring water and free range eggs i thought the cake had a nice flavor to it but it was not what i was expecting i was craving a white cake like wedding cake and went to my local store to find something wheat free gluten free and dairy free i purchased this vanilla cake mix i think it is a very good mix i could not really taste the vanilla flavor but thought it had a nice flavor the cake is yellow dense but not like a pound cake and texture y like brown rice has more texture than white rice i thought the sweetness was just right i think i would purchase again but would make pineapple upside down cake with it 
positive,9/2/18,took me years to find the ultimate chewing gum but when i found wrigley s orbit white peppermint the search ended i have been chewing this gum for many years now i occasionally try something else but nothing ever wins the peppermint in this gum can wipe out the worst of bad breath and toward the end of its chewable life it does not start to taste awful or give you worse breath as many gums will do it simply loses its flavor only drawbacks i usually chew pieces at a time so they are a bit small and they just changed the packaging it used to fit nicely in your back pant pocket inside suit jacket pocket etc now its twice as thick and poorly layed out so it is bulky not sure why they had to change probably to do with retail stores layout this will not prevent me from buying it but it is really annoying wrigley just never change the flavor 
positive,7/12/17,for quite a while before amazon starting retailing food items it was nearly impossible to locate this healthy underground favorite brownie mix there were blogs and food sites bemoaning how hard it was to locate so when we saw it on amazon we ordered a case and baked up batches for all our friends and family the concensus was it tastes healthier but never the less quite good it is far better when prepared with at least a cup of mini chocolate chips not regular chips which can sink to the bottom we buy good quality belgian chocolate minichips this mix is a great alternative if you want less guilt in your guilty pleasures 
positive,24/5/19,if you like goat cheese and smoked cheeses you will love this it has a very smokey creamy flavor try it spread on crackers with a little black truffle oil 
negative,9/3/18,this coffee tastes so nasty i cannot even drink it it is disgusting i cannot believe anything this bitter is acid free i actually threw away two bags 
positive,18/5/18,this was my first purchase of this water it tastes great and the bottles are thicker than most also everyone likes that name haha
positive,23/3/18,surprisingly tasty thin and crip very cracker like and good for snacking i got these for my husband who is on a very low sodium diet these are great for when we travel it is not easy finding prepackaged low sodium foods that taste good but these work quite well 
positive,8/9/20,if you like green tea that brews for minutes max and you do not stew your tea by just leaving the bag in until the tea is bitter this is the tea for you of course it can be done that way but if you have refined tea taste then you will like this tea i personally love the taste of a good green tea i am so glad to find this brand available online no one sells it in my area 
negative,23/2/18,i have to admit based on most of the reviews i was sold on getting the pack was a mistake all three flavors had a distinct taste of the sucralose that is the name of the artificial sweetner in the product if you like splenda you may like this but it has a distinct taste unfortunately not for me a few friends of mine that tried it and said it was not bad unfortunately that was the best of the comments if you really want a good cup of hot chocolate try cafe escapes or swiss miss both are twice as good in my opinion liked the escapes best wish i liked the artificial sweetner but the that taste has a distinct after taste probably would be better without the artificial stuff and more regular sugar if your going to order i would get the small pack to try it better then throwing out try cafe escapes and swiss miss and see for yourself 
positive,18/7/20,i have purchased other hot cocoa cups but find grove square to be about the best of them all i usually add two teaspoons of the the flavored coffeemate creamers my favorite being the sugar free caramel macchiato by adding the sugar free creamer the taste is there but not the calories 
positive,14/6/18,this hot coca tastes pretty good when brewed on setting however its not the best i have ever tasted nor the worst its hard to rate this because everyone has different tastes so its ether you like it or you do not i my self happen to like it and will buy again unless i find something better 
positive,2/11/18,i really like the flavor of this hot chocolate the kids love the flavor too i always keep a box of this in the house as my kids and their friends are avid coco drinkers this makes it easier and less messy even for the younger ones no more powder spilled on the counter tops this way 
positive,14/10/18,my family really enjoys grove square hot cocoa milk chocolate and we keep a supply on hand the excellent price is what made us choose this brand but the taste is what makes us continually renew our order 
positive,6/4/20,the greatest best chocolate taste in any keurig k cups out there will definitely order more everyone in the office tries to steal them i am a chocolate nut and these pass the test 
negative,9/3/18,i was hoping this was a good idea however we tried them even after i heard they tasted bitter like artificial sweetner and it was true not the same as the stuff from the can 
positive,18/5/18,after drinking swiss miss watered down hot chocolates taste for so long this is a very tasty creamy hot chocolate my kids love it so i tried it and its the best i had in a while i will be ordering more 
positive,7/3/18,a pleasant surprise awaited me when i first ordered grove square milk chocolate hot cocoa cups not a coffee drinker i use our keurig k cup brewer mostly to make cocoa and a few other brands i tried simply did not hit the mark grove square cocoa tasted full flavored with just enough chocolate essence to make it a perfect drink the first experience made me anticipate with pleasure the next time i popped a grove square k cup into the machine 
positive,24/1/19,this is really tasty hot chocolate i like it much more than the dark chocolate flavor but that is just my preference 
positive,27/2/19,when i weigh the convenience of a k cup against the price and the taste i would characterize these as a winner not the best cup of cocoa on the planet but compared to making it yourself or using a packet these are pretty darn good they nice a nice chocolate flavor with no funny after taste that i have had with some other brands do not select oz on your machine though make it only at or oz otherwise it will be watery in my opinion all in all a fine cup of hot chocolate 
positive,19/4/20,ok this is not the finest european chocolate but you can make it in your keurig and all flavors taste good i have joined the club and get the lowest possible cost no charge to join and no effort to quit why not it is nice to have when you are dieting because it is just enough chocolate to keep you on track non dieters will like it for the convenience 
positive,17/4/20,very good hot cocoa and price was right awesome and passing the word on the item will buy it again
negative,3/4/20,this tastes like it has artificial sweetener in it and does not taste very chocolatey the name brand cocoa kkups are better or just dumping a regular cocoa packet in a cup and running the water through into it is better 
positive,7/8/19,you cannot beat this deal boxes of k cups for little more then no other store can even match that price for hot chocolate k cups your normally going to be paying around for k cups alone this package give you k cups for a great price the hot chocolate itself is great tasting and can be used on mostly all settings for the except for the travel mug low in calories and great tasting defiantly a must have if you own a keurig brewing system 
positive,9/3/18,not too sweet the best k cup hot chocolate i have tried thus far the kids loved drinking and making the hot chocolate 
negative,18/5/18,i looked forward to a delicious hot cocoa but was very disappointed with the flavor it has an awful aftertaste like the taste you get after drinking a bad diet soda also kind of weak even on the smallest cup setting 
negative,27/1/19,i bought this for my daughter and grandson they both tried it at different times and they both said it had a funny taste and did not drink it therefore i will not buy it again 
positive,10/11/19,great taste and does not have the weird chalky after taste that other hot cocoa k cups have i have tasted several and this by far is the better one but i have to say anything larger than tastes a bit watered down will definitely purchase more but at the rate my family downs these we are probably going to stick to the powdered hot cocoa to be more cost effective 
positive,8/11/19,i love the flavor that this hot chocolate has it is very rich and smooth have tried other brands but did not get the results i wanted i will definately be ordering from this company again 
positive,25/10/21,after trying many of the other hot cocoa k cup options i find that the grove square product tastes the best for my personal taste i find that brewing on the medium cup size setting creates the best taste just add minature marshmellows and it is a great treat however this is not hot chocolate which may be a turn off for some tasters 
negative,8/5/20,i just got a keurig a few weeks ago and wanted to get some hot chocolate for it as an alternative to coffee i did not have super high expectations but these are absolutely awful there is a very strong plastic chemical taste to these k cups i tried all of them and tried putting some milk in them to help mask the chemical taste and nothing will help the only reason i gave these k cups stars is because my boyfriend can tolerate them but i do not trust him because he will eat just about anything in his opinion they are not that good but he will still drink the mug from what i have read of other hot chocolate k cups you would be better off just buying a regular mix and doing it that way 
positive,28/9/18,bought this as a gift and was told it tastes really great too bad i do not have one of those machines otherwise i would try them out myself i might have to consider getting one if you really like it you can save some money by subscribing to it for automatic deliveries and to make sure you do not run out 
positive,29/7/19,out of all of the hot chocolate kcups that i have tried this is by far the best one not weird aftertaste and not watered down tastes amazing and priced fairly what more could you ask for 
negative,9/3/18,i ordered this product because of a good price deal amazon shipped accordingly absolutely no problems there however the taste of this product was horrendous it tasted as if someone through chemicals in a cup and told me to brew it i personally will go back to buying swiss miss in a can and just using the keurig to give me hot water cheaper and much better tasting 
negative,18/5/18,i ordered this specifically b c they said dark chocolate so i was hoping for a rich chocolate flavor they taste very watery even using the lowest amount of water on the keurig the nutritional fact show that it only has grams of sugar where the normal store bought powder has grams i did not like these at all if you are going for something low sugar they might be for you 
negative,17/5/20,nice price and glad to see a subscribe save option on k cups however this was undrinkable in our opinion did not seem to be too watery like another reviewer said just a bad off taste 
positive,26/3/20,for those who do not drink coffee this is a great compliment to the teas and ciders also available for your keurig 
positive,24/2/20,i am very pleased with this selection i have not tried the other hot cocoa brands for keurig but this one is awesome i bought the milk chocolate 
negative,3/5/19,taste nothing like how cocoa should taste i will never touch this again i will be trying the swiss miss cocoa maybe better luck
positive,27/3/20,the hot cocoa does have a sugar substitute in it but as far as i could tell was not strong enough to leave that bitter aftertaste you get when they put a lot of it in the ingredients if you have a very very sophisticated palate perhaps you could taste it a little but it does not take away from the taste of the cocoa so as far as i am concerned it was not an issue i would say this is on par with the type of cocoa you would get in a coffee machine which is fine because i do not hate coffee machine cocoa i have only tried the peppermint so far and it tasted like peppermint what can i say that is what it is supposed to taste like 
negative,31/12/20,there is a taste of sugar substitute the aftertaste turns me off i have even tried using a little bit of milk in the mug before hand to hide the taste it did not so i am just using swiss miss powder and a little milk to make it a creamier hot chocolate before using using my keurig 
negative,13/1/20,i enjoyed these k cups when i used them they tasted pretty good however i quickly noticed that my keurig brewer began to have problems after i started using these and other grove square k cups even when i would brew other cups i would get half brewed cups of coffee smaller cups and other issues i cleaned the brewer following all the instructions and tips in the manual the issues came up again as soon as i used these k cups what i discovered is that the grove square k cups were gunking up my brewer badly i had to clean out every part of the brewer completely including the brewer basket area the water reservoir and the internal mechanism after completing the entire cleaning process two more times my brewer got back to normal i will not order any grove square products again 
negative,21/9/20,this hot chocolate tastes like hot sugar water with a pinch of coco in it although even the sugary taste is weak and tainted by the flavor of the artificial sweetener sucralose the consistency is watery and bland this is when i made the cup as directed by the directions on the box i do not recommend this product 
positive,2/12/20,the price was as fantastic as the taste so convenient to make and no messy powder that is hard to dissolve no major cleanup to deal with either highly recommended 
positive,20/11/19,in my trip through the health area of my local food market i stumbled upon enjoy life boom choco boom dark chocolate bar i just cannot resist trying things such as this into the cart it went it is rather good it says it is dairy nut and soy free and i will take their word the question is taste well it is a good tasting bar i have a couple others that i would regard higher but this one is quite good it is a bit high in calories per bar but has no cholesterol or sodium not bad i will pick it up again gary peterson
positive,2/12/20,i have ordered most of the cheaper tea s etc add on teas and all have been great both in terms of flavor and value i cold brew using disposable tea filters closed with toothpicks in takeya airtight drink maker pitcher jug set of two and it works wonderfully those jugs are great even better if you can still find them half price at costco i am glad i ordered this when i did the price has more than doubled i would still say it is a great value this is my go to tea when i want something with a little more flavor than regular black tea i do not sweeten my tea but i think this would be a perfect sweet tea for a hot day the orange flavor is very palatable unlike some others it is noticeable without being pungent or artificial it also is not spiced like many other orange teas 
positive,11/12/19,i got this for a gift for my father and he loved them i will probably get them again but only as a gift due to the cost of sausages 
positive,20/11/19,this is the best dog food i have ever purchased and having been a dog training for over years i have purchased a lot we first tried this food when our new addition an week old german shepherd joined the family and we wanted to keep him on a natural dog food with any purebred dog health can be an issue and you do not want to fill your dog with by products and plant fillers from day one this food is praised by unbiased pet food reviewers and i do not understand why there is not more publicity for this product our other dog a year old english bulldog with constant skin allergy issues was switched over when we discovered this brand and she has not had an allergic reaction since we did not realize how much it had to do with diet her hair used to fall out in spring not just normal shedding but actual balding from hair loss but this has alleviated that problem as well now our shepherd is a year and a half old and he is eating this large breed adult lamb rice flavor he is not a big eater but he loves this food will definitely keep him and all future pets on this brand as long as they keep their standards as high as they are now kudos diamond for making a wonderful natural dog food side note i would never buy regular diamond brand food if the bag does not say natural on it the standards they are kept to are way lower and the quality suffers immensely stick with natural it is a couple dollars more at most and your dog will be happier and healthier and live a longer life is not that what we all want 
positive,28/6/20,these are better than the usual canned fish filets tastier and not dry there are no bones or skins i worried about mackerel but they are much nicer than say kippered herring filets or sardines in oil it is easy to pour off the olive oil if that is a worry but you would be losing something that is also tasty 
positive,8/8/20,ordered cases on different dates and got them within days cannot find these in the stores so please keep them in stock make for a great meal with some veggies or a salad and this type of fish with omega s is good for you 
negative,14/7/21,i really wanted these to taste good but there is something in there that is very bitter i had to add too much sugar to make them even slightly palatable no one would eat them they looked delicious after baking and they are healthy but that is only if you manage to choke one down i have tried their gingerbread corn muffin mix and jalapeno cornbread mix and those are all great 
negative,2/12/20,i bought these graham sticks based on their excellent reviews and having purchased earth s best organic vanilla cookies had high hopes for a healthy snack to serve my kids needless to say i should have purchased one box at the grocery store first before committing to boxes through amazon which you are unable to return even unopened boxes since this is a food item the crackers smelled strange even before tasting them my year old turned up her nose and refused to eat them anymore after trying a few i wish i could describe the taste but it would be really hard it may sound strange for an organic food but it was almost like a faint chemical smell at best i can say that they were not anything like a regular graham cracker flavor even as an organic option they should have a better taste my year old did eat some of them without complaint so i am hoping she will tolerate them through boxes so i feel like i did not waste my money good price but definitely test one box first to see if you like them 
positive,20/11/19, month old loves to eat them on the go they seem great for a healthy quick and easy snack 
negative,1/3/21,these cups are artifically sweetened with sucralose i did not realize until i tried one and ended up with a little bit of a headache which made me check the ingredient list it is not noted on the front of the box they definitely have an artificial taste i would not buy them again 
positive,5/5/21,slightly crumbly but overall a very good cookie in my opinion very similar to chips ahoy but more airy less dense 
positive,2/12/20,this sauce is very good on anything you cook or grill or you can use it as a dip for veggies etc it has just enough heat to make everything taste better 
positive,20/11/19,i had brought this as a dipping sauce for dumplings and egg rolls i made at home it taste s great and i think it the same sauce i get at some thai places because it tastes the exact same 
positive,9/10/21,several gevalia brand coffee s have been among my favorites for years velvet noir signature blend traditional roast etc the breakfast blend is my go to every day grind it is got a perfect blend of bold rich taste terrific aroma and full taste with very low acidity and harshness just incredible coffee 
positive,6/3/21,these chews are tasty and chewy the price is excellent for what you get we have plenty around for ourselves and to share with family great treat for little kids plus they are good for you with no added junk just licorice great buy great taste 
positive,12/2/21,for those of you who like love black licorice i seriously recommend this product i eat it because i love black licorice and only recently found that what i have observed is now reported by nuitionists as well these is evidence that black licorice is an aid to those with constipation it comes in other flavors too but the medicinal effects only come the black 
positive,2/12/20,this is excellent green tea it is just a little spicy and very flavorful green tea is so good for you you will not even miss your morning coffee and you are helping children when you buy tea district children s tribute tea 
positive,20/11/19,the content has been consistantly good the calamares have been tasty the price was also very reasonable
positive,25/6/21,at my local costco store i bought pace salsa numerous times the salsa tastes feel rich and i love the jalepenos pace puts in the salsa spicy but not too the point where i am sweating and cannot enjoy my salsa and chips the salsa does not feel watered down and this is a great go to salsa choice 
positive,17/3/20,water based sardines without salt is awwfuul not bad of a product here far superior to the types i normally purchase at stores 
positive,20/10/21,i am on a very low sodium intake per day and these are great good taste and low sodium i just put a little mustard on them and yum 
positive,21/7/20,i found out about these from a co worker they are delicious low calorie and pack some protein eating these rather than my usual pretzels and chips helped me slim down i get them by the case now from amazon since it is a better buy and my supermarket does not always carry them 
positive,22/2/21,i have been gluten free for a little over a year and i have struggled with finding tasty and affordable alternatives to my favorite foods the great thing about this mix is that it is really easy to make affordable and the pancakes are so tasty my children do not object to eating them saving me the time of making two batches of pancakes if they did not see me eating them i do not even think my kids would notice that they are eating gluten free pancakes 
positive,8/6/21,it is great i actually used this to make gf donuts the other day i love how convenient it is it is so hard being gluten free so this is god sent for how many things you can make with this i have celiacs and i have not had any sort of negative reaction to this i would definitely recommend this for anyone who cannot have gluten but still wants things like pancakes and waffles and donuts and other fun things 
positive,2/12/20,if you only knew bisquick gluten free gf is by far one of the best options out there for people with celiac or sensitivity to gluten i honestly do not know how healthy it is for you what i do know it that it is a great option for people trying to eat as normal as possible this gf option has been a great meal saver for my wife who this last year was diagnosed with celiac and got sick in tired of tasting gross tasting gf options or super simple meat and vegetables options for meals we have made all types of breakfast items biscuits even fried food chicken tenders mozzarella sticks fried fruit we bout our own little frier http www amazon com dp ref as li ss til tag talkinhome camp creative linkcode creativeasin adid in short it has not only been a great option but also has been quite tasty allowing my wife to make one meal for both of us not worrying that it will taste bad to me hope this was helpful 
positive,20/11/19,neither myself nor my husband can have any type of corn products but we love cornbread this mix makes biscuits that taste just like corn bread to us nice to find an alternative that tastes so great appreciate having this order size option as well since it is often missing from grocery store shelves 
positive,25/1/21,finally a great and easy gf option for pancakes waffles biscuits etc from bisquick both of my kids have celiac and absolutley love this stuff wish the container was bigger but we are just happy to have better tasting options for breakfast now thank you thank you thank you cannot taste a difference but the rest of the family uses the cheaper stuff 
positive,1/7/21,gluten free goes mainstream with the addition of gluten free bisquick general mills does a good job making the gluten free version of their famous brand are you gluten free do you know someone that is an estimated million americans are affected by gluten the protein found in wheat barley and rye grains and most do not even know it gluten is a toxin for many especially those with celiac disease autism diabetes multiple sclerosis crohn s disease and a host of other gluten intolerant and gluten sensitivity issues it is quite challenging for those following a gluten free diet to find and afford products that are gluten free wheat is one of the most prevalent ingredients in the american diet find the best tasting gluten free foods at exclusively we have been serving the gluten free community for over years 
positive,30/9/20,my family loves bisquick pancakes my kids did not notice the difference from this product and regular pancakes the only problem is the price i will try pamelas this week price seems more reasonable 
positive,15/3/20,our family has been wheat free for years and gluten free for so we have tried just about every mix out there i just found that bisquick has a gf mix while in the grocery store and decided to give it a try this is definitely the best mix that we have ever tasted smooth not grainy i do not know that side by side with regular wheat pancakes that you would notice the difference 
positive,6/7/21,i have been gf for the past year and have tried all sorts of flour alternatives this one is certainly the best and the best part about it is you can substitute it for any creation that calls for original bisquick the best so far is the waffles that you can make following the directions on the back i will be ordering again my only complaint is that the boxes are small compared to the other boxes of bisquick available on the shelves 
positive,29/6/21,can as be used to make cookies even egg free i just used the mix enough apple sauce to make a batter some coconut butter and added vanilla and cinnamon and baked turned out soft delicious cookies with only minutes from box to the oven however even wallmart carries this for about one dollar per box less than here 
positive,29/6/21,ok i just bought bisquick gf and the first thing i tried to make were the drop biscuits recipe listed on the box these are not the kind that are rolled out cut these are drop biscuits the results were very tasty the taste of this gf bisquick is very much like the original but the taste is not as tart as the original if you want a similar buttermilk taste you will need to use buttermilk instead of milk in the biscuit recipe i noticed something else that was odd and might be a problem for anyone new to cooking it seems that the amount of mix called for is not quite right i read the side of the box and it claims that there are cups of mix in the box servings of cup each the biscuit recipe called for cups of mix i measured heaping teaspoonfuls into a measuring cup and i do not even have a cup of mix left in the bag i know this mix does not have wheat flour and maybe that kind of flour measures differently maybe if i dug into the bag with a cup i would have used less but the recipe came out right so there must be a misprint on the box i am assuming i measured properly because i have biscuits that can be dipped in gravy smothered with butter jam or sliced to make those yummy mcdonald s breakfast sandwiches by following the instructions i have a lot of biscuits if you are single or just cooking for two you might want to cut the recipe in half you will still have plenty and you will not go through the box so quickly this mix cost me around and i do not have enough left to make anything else without buying another box which i will because these biscuits are really really good still if you are watching your budget do not prepare more than you need about these biscuits yummy fairly golden because the recipe calls for eggs and they can be sliced with some crumbly edges just like glutenous ones without the eggs you probably will not get the nice eye appealing color even though they are drop biscuits you still have to cut in shortening or margarine if you do not have a cutter you will need to use a long fork that is more difficult so if you are a celiac that has been craving biscuits buy a cutter it will cost you as much as a box of this mix the biscuit recipe also calls for milk so if you want that nice tart taste that is reminiscent of the original bisquick you will need to use buttermilk the mix is made up of rice flour sugar leavening potato starch salt xanthum gum many mixes and goodies made with rice flour taste grainy bisquick has done a fantastic job with the rice flour it is not grainy at all i repeat it is not grainy at all for those of you new to celiac cooking using a starch such as corn potato or tapioca is normal and adds a lightness to the baked item that would not be possible with rice flour alone leavening is simply baking soda or powder and is necessary for rising the sugar and salt are for flavor and consistency and yes they are necessary as for the xanthum gum it is a perfectly natural ingredient and it gives celiac safe baked goods a bit of elasticity acting as a replacement for the gluten you will find xanthum gum in just about every baked goodie made for people with celiac disease can you just make your own mix and spend less money sure but you will have a very difficult time finding rice flour as finely ground as the rice flour that is the predominant and main ingredient in this mix the other recipes listed on the box are for pancakes waffles strawberry shortcakes pizza crust ultimate chicken fingers and oven baked chicken you can find more recipes on their website i recommend this product for the taste i do wish that more mix was in the box for the price 
positive,26/7/21,this mix made tasty crispy waffles using a standard waffle iron but the whole box only made waffles this would be a five star product for me if i could get more than one family meal out of it for the price 
positive,21/10/21,my son just started the gluten free diet and i have tried some foods out there just seeing what he will eat he loved it i could not believe it at first but he kept eating i am really glad that i was able to find something that he loves to eat for breakfast my little girl has starring to eat it to and she says it taste good i buy it every time i run out because i love eating it too 
positive,25/10/21,with all natural ingredients and no preservatives all i can say is fantastic there is no expiration date but i would eat this within a week or two faster if it is opened absolutely excellent you can freeze these with no loss of quality do not order if the weather is hot because they ship it in cool bags with cold packs instead of styrofoam with dry ice my orders usually arrive cool but not cold 
positive,29/6/21,i gave this as a stocking stuffer to my husband to remind him of our last holiday in beautiful jamaica it has a truly tropical taste that is very unique and yummy 
positive,5/7/21,this is such a great product from subtle flavors and aromas for delicate dishes to smokey salts for hearty cooking this is a great product for the chef who loves flavor and experimenting in the kitchen this is such a cool product 
positive,17/9/21,i have bought this product before these snacks are crisp and great tasting also low in calories i recommend them highly they are shipped almost instantly and arrive within a few days 
negative,18/8/21,this is the first time we bought this tea from amazon we used to get it directly from revolution tea i do not know if that made any difference or if it was just a change in the tea s composition along with the packaging but what used to be my wife s favorite tea now has a metallic smell and aftertaste with much less of a pomegranate flavor and now a strong almost cheap generic green tea flavor really disappointing especially since we are stuck with six boxes 
positive,31/7/21,this melitta decaf riviera sunset coffee has an excellent taste there is none of the weird aftertaste you get with some other decaf coffees it is a smooth mellow taste even a little sweet and with a hint of cocoa i really enjoyed this the grind is listed as extra fine but i did not find it particularly fine myself when i grind my own beans i have a finer grind than this but i still expected a stronger taste from the melitta than i would from other store brands however the melitta decaf was actually slightly weaker than other store brands we have tried we like our coffee strong about cup ground coffee for to cups water using measuring cups this ratio was not quite strong enough for me with the melitta but that is easily adjustable the nice thing about the coffee is that even when i made it very strong the smoothness remained i will definitely be trying other types of melitta coffee in the future 
positive,18/10/21,wonderful smooth satisfying decaf coffee with a fabulously rich flavor no chemical aftertaste like many decafs i have tried apparently the swiss water process used to decaffeinate this coffee leaves flavor intact something i have found terribly disappointing in other brands i have been very impressed by the flavor dimensions of this riviera sunset blend served it to some neighbors who simply will not touch decaf coffee who were pleasantly surprised to find they actually enjoyed a cup of decaf no bitter notes my husband who usually complains fervently about the flavor of decaf has been asking for a cup of this every evening after dinner believe me this alone is quite an endorsement i love using my zojirushi cd micom electric liter water boiler and warmer champagne gold for coffee tea and cooking i brew my coffee a cup at a time with an individual melitta brown paper filter melitta cone coffee filters natural brown no count filters pack of and filter cone similar to this one ready set joe mug and found that the extra fine grind of the riviera sunset blend imparted an unusually rich deliciously multidimensional flavor much fresher than conventional by the pot coffee this method also allows me to brew strong coffee for me and a milder version for my hubby take time to bloom the grounds first add a little hot water to the fresh coffee grounds moistening completely and then wait about seconds before brewing for best flavor this goes for any coffee melitta s riviera sunset decaf blend is enthusiastically recommended by a coffee snob you will love it as is no sweeteners or creams needed to disguise this wonderful flavor i look forward to ordering more update just ordered my first pack through subscribe save great deal for some delicious decaf 
positive,29/6/21,disclaimer i am a coffee addict i am also a starbucks addict so i have become a bit snobby about my coffee preferences and cannot stand the economy stuff i have had regular melitta coffee before and was favorably impressed by it so i decided to give the decaf version a try especially when the weather gets cold i like a nice hot cup of coffee in the evenings and do not particular want to be tossing and turning hours later the riviera sunset decaf coffee is an excellent decaf for those times you do not want the real thing it had a nice rich flavor with no bitter aftertaste while i continue to prefer the real thing on most occasions i am glad to know there is a good flavorful substitute for when i do not want caffeine 
positive,16/9/21,i have tried to give up my coffee habit but it just has not been easy dh and i did manage to switch to decaf a couple years ago so i suppose that is something i am a moderate coffee drinker i like cups of hot joe to get me started in the morning and love a nice chilly iced coffee on a hot afternoon this melitta riviera sunset decaf is smooth and does not have the bitter aftertaste that i dislike in one of the leading coffeeshop brands the flavor is great and i have enjoyed it both hot and iced 
positive,24/8/21,this coffee smelled wonderful while it was brewing my husband drinks a lot more coffee than i do and he agreed that this is a great tasting coffee we are looking forward to trying melitta s other varieties 
positive,24/6/21,this is the best decaf my family and i have tried in a long time it is smooth not bitter and has enough flavor without being too strong like some other brands i have tried i like that it is decaffeinated using the natural swiss water process instead of chemicals that is a big plus for me because many brands do not tell you how they decaffeinate their coffee i usually buy whole bean but this ground is so nice and fine and it saves me time having to grind it and get it just right i would suggest following the instructions given on the bag for the best taste seal tightly and store in the refrigerator to keep the flavor this is one i will be buying again 
positive,27/9/21,i have had to cut back on caffeine recently because of heart palpitations that seemed to be made worse by all the coffee i drink cups a day maybe so i am mixing melitta colombian and decaf i substituted this for the other decaf i have been drinking and found that it has a rich smooth taste very little to none of the burnt taste that decaf often has the price on amazon makes it a pretty good buy as well i do not care for the packaging however i could not get it open without cutting the top and then i had to transfer it to an old coffee can to store it with all the mess that that entails if it were in a can i would be more inclined to buy it but the taste for a decaf is quite good 
positive,29/6/21,hands down by far the absolute worst tasting tea i have ever had and i have allot i am an avid tea drinker and i just cannot get it down the benefits are supposed to be amazing so i will keep it around to water down and sugar up but wow it is bad so strong too tastes like dirt that is been pissed on in the woods 
positive,5/8/21,my husband and i both like coffee with rich flavor and good taste but we do not like the bitter or burnt taste some coffees have this community hazelnut has excellent flavor we make it fairly strong and are very pleased with this coffee 
positive,29/6/21,the sinus buster tea had an interesting aroma when seeping it is taste is acquired not offense at least to say more like burnt bark or really overheated coffee i had no drainage of my sinuses while drinking one cup of the tea the next morning i could feel relief of pressure and pain i would prefer this product over any inhaled sinus relief agent as a plus all the ingredients of the tea are on the package in english nothing unknown 
negative,31/7/21,i have been paleo for six months as has my partner we both found these inedible all four kinds which by the way taste nearly the same i am not sure what it is about them either it seems like they would be good from the ingredients but something about the combination of flavors just does not taste good i kept trying them again hoping that they would grow on me they sure did not we finally tossed them so i would advise getting just one from a local co op or something before you buy a whole bunch online i sure which i had 
positive,11/9/21,my husband has to limit the amount of sugar he takes in and these contain no sugar and they taste great 
positive,12/8/21,i had coconut trees growing in my backyard in southeast asia and enjoyed drinking coconut water right from the coconut itself taste nirvana real coconut water with pulp is the closest to the real thing that i have found 
positive,31/7/20,great sauce used in many jamaican restaurants to help with the heat of the jerk seasoning most use walkerwood jerk seasoning to make the jerk and pour this on later on the jerk or the rice 
negative,13/6/20,these are very tasty but way too sweet sugary i felt like i was eating candy instead of meat if that is okay with you then you will probably love these but i was looking for something a bit healthier yes i know it says sweet in the product name but i bought it because of the no hormone no antibiotic no artificial ingredient aspect 
positive,31/7/20,i do not eat chips often but when i do these are some of my favorites they have all the flavor and texture of traditional tortilla chips but it is the subtle lime flavoring that makes them special the lime flavoring appears to be a seasoning that has been dusted on some chips seem to have barely any flavor and i find myself looking for those with the most still none of them have quite enough for my tastes i wish that these chips had more that just a hint of lime 
positive,13/6/20,i have tried tons of gf pancake mixes i could choke on most of them or just decide not to ever eat pancakes again these are so moist and delicious my year old grandmother was just diagnosed with celiac disease she loves them too my wife and children who are not gf also love them m
positive,26/9/20,i was expecting hard tasteless healthy cookies it is soft a little chewy and yummy very tasty 
positive,17/10/20,these are excellent they taste great and are just the right size two can make an on the go breakfast that is tasty and good for you the larger size breakfast cookies are just too big of these are perfect my husband had gotten out of the habit of eating breakfast too much trouble but since i bought these he is good about grabbing one or two on the way out the door 
positive,14/12/20,i think this is a really good deal i seal it up in a rubbermaid container and just scoop it out to brew good stuff 
positive,29/5/20,i normally purchase already grown containers of cat grass at my local pet store however the last few pots developed bugs in them which just was not sanitary i bought these seeds from hirts and they grew insanely fast my cats love the taste i have already bought another pack so i can re plant once the cats finish off this batch 
positive,9/12/20,i love these they really taste like a soft pb j sandwich and you can bring them anywhere kids would love them too i hope they are available again soon because i am running low 
positive,4/8/20,since republic of tea discontinued their bing cherry vanilla tea i was looking for a replacement the flavor of this tea is very different from republics it is better the smell is very rich like toasted vanilla and cherry it almost has a coffee smell but not quite i do not like coffee but this tea is incredible glad i found it best of all the price 
positive,31/7/20,this coffee was delicious i actually purchased it as a gift but since i paid for lb of coffee i tasted the freakin coffee it was so good i meant to purchase the light roast but accidentally ordered the medium it was full bodied and delicious totally lacking the high acidity that you find with most commercial coffees i cannot afford pure kona all the time and normally buy blends but this coffee is the delicious gourmet coffee you need to buy and keep for company or to treat yourself now and then 
positive,13/6/20,key lime pie is one of my all time favorite desserts when i heard about this gum i was definitely a skeptic i figured it would taste more like just a standard citrus y mint gum i was wrong this definitely tastes like real key lime pie filling actual key lime flavor with a milk sweet taste that is not too overpowering the flavor actually lasts for quite a while too though it is much more powerful within the first minutes try it 
positive,21/11/20,i loved the flavor and the fact that it was so long lasting everyone in the office eats it now we only eat half a stick so we are not sitting around with a big wad of gum in our cheeks but so far i have not been able to outchew this gum for flavor if you like a bright citrus y taste that is not too overpowering you will love this if you like a more minty gum then go for the mint chocolate chip flavor of this gum 
positive,25/5/21,like other reviewers i had low expectations for this gum but was happily wrong i love key lime pie and lime flavor in general when first chewed this gum has the tangy bite of key lime with a creamy sweetness and a hint of graham cracker crust flavor after the initial flavor burst fades there is that surge of artificial sugary sweetness that occurs with some brands flavors of sugarfree chewing gum but the surge is not as overwhelming or long lasting as it is with some sugarfree gums once that fades the gum has a mellow subtle lime zest flavor i really like this gum 
positive,25/5/21,i just like all the other reviewers love this seasoning i have been making cajun catfish with this seasoning for about years i have tried other seasonings when this one was not available but it is just not the same if you want to try my recipe it is very easy i melt butter and brush the catfish fillet with it and generously coat the fish with the seasoning meanwhile i preheat a cast iron skillet when the skillet is hot i put in about tbs olive oil and than about tbs of butter and fry the fish to a golden to dark brown on each side about minutes and add some more butter if the pan becomes to dry after turning the fish during this i make a pot of spaghetti my wife likes angle hair after the pasta is done drain it and remove the fish to a platter turn off the heat under the skillet add a little more olive oil and butter scrape up the bits of fish left on the bottom of the skillet and dump the pasta into the skillet and mix it around to soak up the buttery oil than sprinkle some more seasoning on the pasta and serve with the fish everyone love it to give this dish a little color you can add a bag of fresh spinach to the pasta water during the last minutes of cooking or stir in a small can of diced cajun tomatoes after you put the pasta in the skillet or use both hope you enjoy it if you try it 
positive,20/1/21,i have been using this spice mix for many years but i have found it hard to find lately i decided i would check amazon and i was very surprised to see it available i am a fairly good cook and i have developed some easy dishes using this mix and it is very unusual and tasty a pack is a lot of this spice but it does keep for years and i use it quite often give your family the kick it deserves with luzianne cajun seasoning 
negative,15/1/21,my baby did not seem into these dinners so i tried them they are not terrible but not good either we will stick with the eb fruits and veggies until she is ready for table foods 
positive,8/2/21,i bought this for my month old grandson to try he loves it i am so pleased that i am ordering it for my infant great niece and also for part of an all organic baby shower gift this food is inexpensive convenient and organic best of all he likes it i am setting up the recurring delivery method for my grandson correction the product i ordered two weeks ago was a case now the cost is that is quite a price hike is there any way to be notified if the price goes back down 
positive,10/2/21,liked the baby food yes for myself p really tasty and smooth consistency for an organic treat except the peaches and apricots not soo much nice flavor and such really good though and timely shipping excellent buyer 
positive,9/10/20,this is the best tasting brown rice i have ever had kind of a nutty flavor this is the only rice i have ever had that tastes great all by itself 
positive,31/7/20,here is a great way to get that tast of your childhood without all the sugar even without blood sugar problems i want to cut back on any excess sugar this allows you to have a drink option other than water with a perky taste that is low calorie and sugar free parents do not tell the kids and just serve it they will never know the diffrence its that good
positive,13/6/20,i have been searching for alternatives for high calorie high sugar drinks after tasting many different products this one is my favorite by a long shot i cannot believe it has no sugar at all the little packets make a nice quantity of the beverage some of the other brands i have tried gave me heartburn or they were not sweet enough this one is perfect i tried the cherry flavor also which is good but not as good as the tropical you have to be careful with spilling it because it does tend to stain but any traditional stain remover did just fine at preventing the stains from setting in to carpet clothes and countertops ditch the sugary alternatives and you can save hundereds of calories per day just by using this instead cutting calories just became a lot more easy edit i still use this product multiple times a day it is great to have a premixed drink in the fridge that you can go to that tastes great and you do not have to worry about calorie intake or getting the kids all hyped up from sugars i also took packets on vacation and mixed it on site saved time and money instead of stocking a fridge up when you would just have to throw away the unused portion at the end of the trip i just wish they made a orange and maybe a berry flavor as well 
positive,5/12/20,the tropical punch flavor tastes just like i remember as a kid easy to use and fully dissolves in cold water although i will use a chopstick or knife to stir the mix while the water is filling 
positive,1/11/20,i have been having blood sugar and yeast issues and i have had to cut out sugar i had never tried sugar free kool aid before so i was a bit nervous about this one luckily i found the taste to be really good even my picky kids love it i love the fact that these come pre sweetened in individual pouches you just tear one open and stir it into quarts of water it could not be faster or easier it even dissolves well in cold water i just ordered a case of the cherry flavor too my kids and i cannot get enough of the tropical punch flavor so we are excited to try cherry too 
negative,14/1/21,maybe it is just me but i have used this extract in my oatmeal same amount as mccormick extracts and i cannot taste any flavor at all very disappointing 
negative,6/6/21,i believe gerber may have mixed apricots with the peaches it now has a sour after taste and my son hates it 
negative,21/7/20,they have some textured powder stuff on them that makes them taste bad bad after taste i guess it is so they do not stick together never again
negative,5/1/21,i do not like the taste of this at all i have some other fennel tea from another company not on amazon and it is fantastic cannot remember exact name but think it is something like mb is a french company and i got it in canada and by mail order after that it is much better to my taste never dreamed there would be this much variance among fennel seeds as only ingredient 
positive,23/1/21,i got a case of yuban cans from amazon for an amazing price and now that i have been reintroduced to yuban i am sticking with it it is colombian which is the coffee i prefer anyway but yuban must have a special formula for roasting and grinding that results in such excellent coffee cans have the foil seals that you can peel off so you do not need to use a can opener and of course plastic lids to reseal sniffing this coffee as i scoop it into my coffee maker is half the delight just so excellent and suits my tastes perfectly buying the case is very convenient too 
positive,31/7/20,and a great price from amazon my wife and i had dinner last night at a very high end restaurant and while everything was magnificent we both thought the coffee was not as good as our yuban i often wonder about starbucks whose coffee i find undrinkable my son says it is an acquired taste 
positive,13/6/20,bought these at a local store due to the great ingredients with none of the bad chemicals and have been waiting for them to be in stock here i will definitely buy more when they are available as they are the best shortbread cookies i have ever had my son agrees and i love that they are basically as good as you could get if you made them yourself with ingredients you can pronounce and will not kill you so delicious 
positive,1/12/20,i buy these at a local grocery store not from amazon com they are absolutely lovely light and crisp they are like naked cheetos that are actually fairly healthy they can be topped with most anything sweet or savory great for midnight snacks afternoon snacks or crumbled up in tomato soup at lunch or dinner wish they would make them in flavors they would beat the pants off most diet snacks i have ever seen 
positive,30/1/21,since i am counting calories i find wasa crisp n light very tasty you can eat three of them and feel like you are eating a lot more than you really are i think the taste is great and have told all my friends about them 
negative,1/1/21,i have a tried a few of these wasa crisp breads this one was by far the worst it was in essence entirely flavorless it tasted to me the way that i expect that those little packing styrofoam peanuts would taste do not get me wrong it did not taste bad hence the stars it just did not taste like anything looking for a low cal snack type cracker try the wasa sourdough rye crackers now those are heavenly 
positive,11/1/21,my wife always made her own gravy from scratch and is good at it however this gravy is fantastic idiot proof even i can make it and reminds me of my grandma s cooking my wife loves it and this will definitely be a new staple for our cupboard 
positive,31/7/20,awesome tasting tea in a oz can i highly recommend this product because it taste great and does not cost a lot 
positive,13/6/20,i make an extended butter using this oil water and liquid lecithin it is just the best tasting spread ever and much healthier because of the walnut oil i keep mine refrigerated to preserve that wonderful taste and aroma it tends to settle out so be sure to shake it before using to get the full flavor and consistency i did not know to do this on the first container and when i got to the bottom it was very thick almost sludgy with the roasted bits amazon s price is pretty fair although i can occasionally find it locally tj maxx a bit cheaper but i must say ordering from amazon and getting it shipped straight to me is very convenient i have never had any problems with damaged or leaking containers on this product well maybe a small dent in the metal but that is all 
positive,14/1/21,so happy i got this on a subscription i might even have to increase the frequency that it is delivered i have used it in everything from scrambled eggs to brownies it is not mild like olive oil but it has enhanced the flavor of everything i have cooked 
positive,7/12/20,this oil has a wonderful mild roasted walnut flavor that i found irresistible in a salad dressing it will now be my go to oil for homemade dressings there is a recipe for vinaigrette right on the back of the can bought it because it is omega content is second only to flaxseed oil plus it is made in california definitely buy it on amazon so much cheaper than the grocery store 
positive,5/5/21,the first moment you bite into this cracker you will notice the difference this tasty crunchy organic cracker is perfect with soup or salad it is certified organic using quality ingredients the cracker is dry not greasy or oily like a typical potato chip comes in several different varieties and flavors recommended 
positive,23/11/20,this is a terrific baby food it has beef and spinach and tastes great it was the first meat baby food my son would eat i tasted it myself and it is quite good 
positive,29/8/20,my daughter loves this she is picky so she does not always eat as many healthy foods as she should this flavor gives her the vegetables and protein that she needs it is a little bit grainier than other stage foods but still very usable for babies over months 
positive,18/1/21,we live in the middle of nowhere so we end up ordering a lot of spices etc that cannot be found locally this gives great chipotle taste with just a little sprinkled on i am going to order a few more of these because i never want to run out of it 
negative,18/6/21,i purchased this coffee to make iced coffee drinks it has very little coffee taste and the dark chocolate taste is more chemical than chocolate similar to the taste of flavoring used in baking i will not be purchasing this coffee again my suggestion to those considering a purchase buy something else 
negative,18/6/21,i have a one one coffee pod machine and have ordered pods online before these looked good and sounded like high quality coffee albeit a little pricey for pods this was the worst cup of coffee i have ever tasted it left a bitter taste in my mouth that lingered for hours yuck do not be fooled by the fancy name and packaging it tastes like rocket fuel fortunately amazon refunded my money when i explained how bad it was throwing the whole box away 
positive,7/7/21,okay so let me preface my review by saying that i do not drink hot chocolate that often and i am from america and do not think i have ever had hot chocolate while traveling in europe but my husband is a british citizen who grew up in india with summers in england and he has searched high and low for a chocolate drink that would remind him of those from his childhood we found it in this drink and he will not drink any other chocolate drink now not even the other kinds that are in my pantry that i bought for him to try and after cup he turned his nose up at them men 
negative,18/6/21,having liked the various types of ghirardelli chocolate and premium hot cocoa s i decided to try some ghirardelli chocolate premium hot cocoa mix chocolate mocha after trying several cups of this i started to wonder what happened to the ghirardelli chocolate as myself i thought it was overpowered with the coffee taste not my cup of hot cocoa 
positive,7/7/21,very good lemonade mix close to fresh in taste love that it has stevia i like it so much more than crystal light or any of the other mixes with artificial sweeteners i can take it anywhere mix it in bottled water and have a refreshing healthy safe cool drink 
positive,1/7/21,my wife has a difficult time getting enough iron and supplements are very hard on her stomach with of the usrda of iron in one serving of this blackstrap molasses she can very easily get the iron she needs this is not in any way hard on her stomach either it tastes very good compared to other blackstraps we tried a few have a slight edge on taste but none on iron content blackstrap is an acquired taste but worth it for natural nutrients this definitely picked up her step within a very short time she gets low energy and tired when she needs iron we will definitely be buying this again 
positive,7/7/21,wow this tastes great sweet and chocolaty like a liquid chocolate bar plus it is organic it does contain high glycemic cane juice so i do not drink too much the original and vanilla flavors are sweetened with low glycemic rice syrup they have less sugar all are organic i do not know why the ingredients here say canola oil neither the good karma website nor the label on the box has that ingredient if i verified that this site is correct and the good karma corporate website and the label on the carton are wrong i would stop using the product perhaps this page has outdated ingredient information this is the richest most milk like rice beverage and the label on it does not mention canola oil which contains up to toxic erucic acid and is found in many rice beverages that are fed to children canola oil cannot be used by us fda regulation in infant food one research paper found higher levels of erucic acid in red blood cells of autistic children compared to non autistic children and there are many other well established toxic effects of erucic acid in humans and animals look in the medical journals this product is sold in my neighborhood ralph s best price vc discount and whole foods in los angeles the brand whole foods own brand is also canola free it is much cheaper but watery in comparison i use it for cooking only plain and vanilla flavors though west soy rice beverage is also canola free it has a more neutral taste and less body they have a chocolate flavor many people find rice milk better tasting than other milk substitutes i find it to be much easier to digest than soy and nut products soy milk however has much more protein aside from being hard to digest i do not eat too much soy because of the anti nutritional components so i get my protein elsewhere 
positive,23/7/21,i have tried a bunch of them and the taste of this product is outstanding even the folks behind the counter at my gym commented on it and they sell a competing product give it a try you will not be disappointed 
positive,20/7/21,great meal replacement drink that tastes great you get plenty of protein and other vital nutrients i prepare one of these whenever i am on the go and i will not have to worry about missing a meal the best bang for your buck especially if you subscribe to the amazon subscribe and save program 
positive,19/7/21,listen if you want a good taste and hot this the stuff it will not melt your eyes out but it is too hot to take straight one dab will do ya on a bite of pizza 
positive,18/6/21,if you are the kind of guy who really enjoys a huge slab of bacon with your breakfast not that wimpy kind of stuff they serve at a restaurant but the kind that hunters grab when they are together thick with lots of fat in the middle you will enjoy these you can almost feel your cholesterol count go up as you bite into them now i must admit i am a wimpy crispy kind of gal and i like my bacon on the lean side in fact with my allergies i have to use morningstar soy bacon do not cringe so when i bit into these i realized from the very first bite i was not their intended audience nope these are not girl food they are man food if you want to carry a bag of these out to serve to your fishing or hunting buds early in the morning this is the perfect selection for you however you might want to consider the david s signature beyond gourmet jelly beans man mix for a selection or the milder and tamer david s signature beyond gourmet jelly beans flavor sampler both will give you a variety to try just in case you do not like bacon as much as you think you do i am grateful to have received samples of all of these from the company to try and am basing my review on the samples which they sent oh i passed the rest of my bacon ones on to my guy buddies 
positive,7/7/21,this is a very tasty product this is my first time trying this and i am glad i ordered it to see how it tastes as a product i would order it again one odd thing though that will because me to lower this rating from stars to is that the listing here says a pound but on the label ounces is crossed out and ounces is written next to it i did not weigh the container to confirm this but if it is ounces then then they need to update their listing to show such since i consider shipping to not be part of a product review i will not lower my star rating for this and consider this to be just a mention of this then but the shipping was slow i ordered it on june a usps tracking delivery confirmation number was generated on the to be fair but it took until july for me to get this even taking into account that there was a major holiday july that just seems too slow everything was packaged well enough although without anything like a blue ice pack to keep it cold for summer shipping but just took a long time to get here i do suspect the order was not truly shipped until the week before the july weekend despite a tracking number being generated on june 
negative,27/6/21,it tastes like jack links brand not wild bill s even the texture is totally different from wild bill s not recommended 
positive,21/7/21,i grew up in southern california so i have had my share of sweet corn cakes at local restaurants this mix is a great way to make these at home i prepared a package of these for a friend of mine who lives on the east coast and had never tried a corn cake she is now addicted but cannot find them at her local store thank goodness for amazon 
positive,18/6/21,over the past two years thanks to amazon i have been sampling jerky from literally all over the you s i finally found a tasty jerky that does not give my jawbone a workout great meat flavor an excellent snack 
negative,7/7/21,these little taffy s are expensive i think i paid around for the pound they taste good but man do they give me gas after eating about my stomach would be rumbling for a few hours and i would have to pass gas a lot my girlfriend would not let me eat them before bed hahaha there was never any pain involved just gas i know it was these doing it because we tested it over a few different days i would not eat the taffy some days and would be fine all it took was a few pieces and an hour late the bubble guts would start this information may be useful since its not on amazon sugar free does not carb free a pound bag is from the manufacturer website ingredients hydrogenated starch hydrolysate partially hydrogenated soybean and or coconut oil acid combinations for flavor citric acid and or tartaric acid egg albumin salt lecithin sucralose natural and artificial flavors combinations of red blue blue yellow nutrition facts serving size amount per serving calories cal from fat daily value total fat saturated fat trans fat cholesterol sodium total carbohydrate sugar protein 
positive,30/6/21,i bought this product because it looked good not knowing if it would taste as good as it looked well it finally showed up by usps well packaged it is soft smells great and tastes even better you will not be disappointed i have already eaten five strips 
positive,1/7/21,i just love skittles for a while we had them here in brazil south america but then for some reason i could not find them anymore so when my aunt is coming down for a visit i ask her to bring me some this time i decided to spare her the shopping trouble and i bought it through amazon and had it sent to her place the bag was a bit larger than i expected but i guess this was a good thing right 
positive,24/8/21,i ordered these because i could not seem to find this size at the store there were a couple skittle shells at the bottom of the bag from the shipping of the product but everything else was fine 
positive,21/7/21,i actually tasted the berry vanilla flavor if you have ever eaten a fig newton then try to imagine a fig newton minus the fig center with rice crispies mixed up in it it tastes a little grainy at first but once i read the ingredients and realized that the grains were puffed rice i was more at ease really a good taste one of the better gluten free casien free egg free cookies i have eaten 
negative,25/6/21,i purchased these because they do not contain dairy soy or corn well in addition to being dairy free soy free they are flavor free absolutely horrible dry tasting bars first words out of my mouth were tastes like dirt so that is what i am going with do not waste your money 
positive,13/9/21,no matter how wholesome a snack may be it is worthless unless the girls approve in this case they both give the science diet jerky treats two paws up i like that beef is the first ingredient in the recipe and there are none of those unrecognizable ingredients created in a science laboratory the treats are a nice size and have just enough chew to satisfy for piper our shih tzu with a few missing teeth i break the treats into smaller pieces so she can manage them on the package use within weeks of opening satisfaction guaranteed keep this bag out of the reach of pets and children 
positive,18/6/21,i was amazed at the actual taste of this product the amount of protein and the lack of fat is really good they have a lot more flavors and all of the combinations are really good 
positive,7/7/21,great taste there is a slight bitterness to this tea but it is black tea it is bound to be a little bitter especially for being so strong the strength is perfect for customizing to taste some people like strong tea while others like theirs very mild so you can add more water if you want i like to make a fairly strong tea the melting ice dilutes it just fine and sweeten it myself i like sweet tea but usually when i get it it just tastes like sugar water these give me the strong tea flavor i love and i can add the perfect amount of sweetness great product 
positive,15/7/21,i ordered this assorted bartons turkish delight it is delicious i took it to my parents house for my sister s birthday among her gifts which i also bought at amazon everyone at the party loved this turkish delight so much they even wanted to buy it for them and i told them amazon go there they have everything amazon thank you as allways bringing us international flavors without leaving our homes 
positive,11/7/21,i ordered these to use for marathon training i have a sensitive stomach but have had no problems with these they do give me energy during those long runs 
positive,7/10/21,i tasted a few of these and they are pretty good i was expecting something a bit flavorless and i can imagine happily snacking on these for a multi day packing hike i will write more after i have taken them on the trail 
positive,6/7/21,stingers are better tasting and more convenient than gels and work just as well to provide energy when exercising over long periods of time 
positive,18/6/21,i was excited to try these little honey chews to help with my energy levels during exercising and running i am years old and about pounds overweight i find it hard to keep my energy up day after day while running and exercising first of all these are so tasty without being overly sugary i was surprised though to see that the ingredients were not mostly honey and the first ingredient listed which is suppose to be what the item has the most of is tapioca syrup i guess with the package calling it honey stinger i was thinking that it was pure honey with some taste enhancers still everything is organic which i suppose should add to it is value i found that i felt no energy boost during my activities but i can say that without a doubt that these make you feel like you can keep going and going it is not something that feels like you are really energetic but more like you just got a good days rest and are ready to get going i do not like feeling like i am on a sugar high with that nervous feeling in my chest and these do not do that i think they make you feel healthy and are a good addition to your diet for exercising the only drawback to me is the cost of these for bags makes it hard to justify the purchase as often as you would like to have them i will purchase again when my grocery money allows i would recommend to buy if you are looking for a healthy pickup to keep you going all day and not just for a quick boost 
positive,7/7/21,i did not want caffeine do not want the high calories went through many types of energy chews gels drinks online to see what would be the best option for myself i love the honey stingers no caffeine calories can be controlled depending on how many pieces you take and most importantly it lasted me through my marathon trainings fruit smoothy is delicious have not tried the other flavors 
positive,27/7/21,this tastes great and i like that it is more natural than most other sodas available basically it is a carbonated juice i generally prefer a larger oz size though 
positive,13/7/21,i like the taste of this drink in many ways it takes me back to my childhood with the orange ice lollies i used to eat as it has a similar flavour the thing you should be aware of is that although it has no added sugar because it has so much fruit juice it does have a lot of calories i also found that the can needed to be bigger as i wanted more at the end 
positive,13/9/21,i put my orange switch in the refrigerator overnight to make it nice and cold and i had it with breakfast i love the taste of it mostly orange with a hint of carbonation it tastes sweet naturally and i am sure it is good for you i would buy this product 
positive,7/9/21,this is a very refreshing carbonated juice drink with no aftertaste i love the flavor and the fact that there is no added sugar it is more subtle than orange so really kills a thirst the size is perfect for times when you do not really want a ounce drink 
positive,17/4/21,i really like this drink my only complaint is that i would need to drink cans at a time is a wee bit on the petite side for me if it came in a can i would be much more likely to buy it and the packaging would be much less costly really tasty product though and i have got no quarrels with the ingredients yum 
positive,10/3/21,this is almost the kind of fruit soda i would make if i were going into this business the difference is that i would go the odwalla route and not use reconstituted juice concentrate and only use orange tangerine juices since it is a carbonated beverage i would probably use a stabilizer too so it would not have to be shaken before drinking that would result in a higher price though not sure how much higher than the almost can price it is being offered as a grocery item imagine the price in a vending machine for this product the first ingredient is apple juice and the second is grape juice then comes the tangerine and orange juice and finally acerola juice a fruit high in vitamin c and apparently popular in puerto rico and barbados there is acacia gum as a stabilizer probably do not want to have to shake a carbonated drink and then additional natural colors and flavors ascorbic acid and soy my daughter and i shared a can and liked the taste on a par with orangina my personal preference would be for a little more carbonation but this was ok i am a traditionalist so i definitely prefer a can the quantity at this price makes me feel a little ripped but then i prefer to make my own lemonade in the blender adding in some raspberries or strawberries or mint to vary the flavor cheers 
negative,17/4/21,in proportion this drink is about equal to a regular soda in calories and sugar content but i would prefer a regular soda than this stuff there is a slight citrus taste but mainly from acidity and a horrible after taste of metal and sickly sweetness that lingers for several minutes after wards soda water with natural juice should be a refreshing pleasant and nice refreshment but none of these traits are in this drink i would be embarrassed to serve this beverage to anyone i liked for any occasion but would consider giving it to people i really did not care for to see their reaction avoid this one orange crush or a different orange soda diluted with soda water would taste far better or soda water and regular orange juice would also be a treat that puts this nasty stuff to shame 
positive,21/1/21,i do not know how to describe switch orange tangerine without sounding like a cliche advertising slogan but the truth is it really is very refreshing just the right amount of carbonation too this stuff tastes like what you would get if you squeezed part tangerine and part orange and then poured in a bit of sparkling soda very fresh tasting not too sweet at all the label says there is no sugar added fine as it does not need any the label also says it has apple and grape juice i taste mostly the tangerine myself but you may find your mileage varies finally it is supposed to give you a full days worth of vitamin c ok a lot of drinks can do that nowdays but without any refined sugar of high fructose corn syrup or artificial sweetener i could totally see replacing my orange soda with this stuff i have not seen this in the market yet but i would be willing to try other flavors and add switch to the many beverages i enjoy really for a fruit drink it is pretty darn good 
positive,30/1/21,there is nothing wrong with this drink but it really just tastes like any other orange soda kudos to the switch for not adding artificial flavors sugar or corn syrup though it tastes pretty clean and refreshing but a bit expensive for what it is do not let the small sized can fool you this is not an energy drink it is just an orange soda 
negative,13/2/21,if you like orange crush you may become a fan but it is too much of a hybrid for me the main two ingredients are reconstituted apple and grape juices it contains something called acerola juice which is high in vitamin c and indeed the can contains of your c and of your a the sugar content is high grams which brings the carb percentage up to for the day and the calorie count to i think it tastes too acidic for anyone who is watching carbs and calories to be willing to spend them on switch which almost tastes like carbonated tang i have tried the ooba drinks and they are much lighter and more refreshing guess i am just not ready to make the switch 
positive,15/1/21,if you are a regular drinker of orange soda pop you might like this switch orange tangerine carbonated juice beverage i thought the flavor was very good and appreciated that it was only mildly carbonated not so fizzy that i had gas after drinking it at calories per small serving however this is not something i would regularly drink it is much healthier to eat whole fruit since it is more filling that simply drinking the extracted juice in part because of the fiber associated with eating whole foods still this is a healthier option for those who regularly drink sugared sodas 
positive,6/3/21,this is a wonderfully refreshing citrus drink not too sweet or too sour just enough bubbles to make it sparkle i would imagine it could make a great addition to a punch if you chose to add it to your favorite fruit juice the only draw back for me is that it is a tad bit too expencive to replace our families normal beverage of choice but it sure does make a terrific treat to keep around for an occational indulgence 
positive,8/6/21,i enjoyed the flavor of this orange soda it was not overly sweet and the orange flavor had just enough tartness to it i am glad it does not have any hfcs in it but the calorie count is still quite high from the natural sugars all in all if you are looking for a good orange soda try this one 
negative,7/1/21,the product may be every bit as healthy as they claim but even if that is true i could barley get down one can of this stuff it tastes like sour orange juice with some carbonation in it it does not taste anything like orange soda and the taste it does have is not very pleasant also leaves a very nasty aftertaste and like many sodas this will leave you more thirsty than when you started drinking all in all i cannot recommend this stay away 
negative,17/4/21,i expected to like this drink because i like various fruit juices and i like carbonated beverages as well unfortunately i just did not like the consistency or the taste of this drink it was thick had very little bubbly carbonation and for me anyway there was a very unpleasant aftertaste that lasted a loooong time i finally brushed my teeth really well and used some strong mouthwash to get rid of the taste in my mouth 
positive,10/3/21,i really liked the tatste of this it actually tastes like you are getting the juice from a tangerine i think the carbonation gives it that zing taste you can only get biting into an tangerine orange etc my daughter however really did not like it not sweet enough for her i think it is a little pricey not sure i would be willing to plunk down that much for it the can is very small fl ozs which is a proper serving of orange juice which makes it around a can or a little less but overall i truly enjoyed that zinging tangerine taste 
negative,14/1/21,this is for sure not what i was expecting it to taste like it is not bad but not for me i like the carbonation and juice idea with no added sugar when i first took a sip of it i noticed it has a bite to it the best way i can describe it is a non alcoholic champagne i however did like it better than the watermelon but still not for me 
positive,24/5/21,this relatively expensive convenience packaged item is percent juice and contains calories worth of concentrated apple grape tangerine orange and acerola juice reconstituted with carbonated water acacia gum some soy and added vitamin c to provide percent of the adult minimum daily requirement there are no artificial flavors or additives which allows the manufacturer to describe this as a natural beverage i often mix juice with seltzer water and i like the combination quite cold the switch orange tangerine tasted more like orange soda with a tangerine chaser than what i am used to as juice flavor the carbonation makes the drink seem lighter than juice but not as light and refreshing to the mouth as juice and seltzer the tangerine flavor made the taste seem more appealing than orange soda but the orange and tangerine flavors do not last as long as soda flavors do on the palate i would drink this again on a hot day if i could buy it inexpensively enough 
negative,14/10/21,my daughter i were excited about trying this flavor as we both love orange juice this product did not impress us enough to order it as we liked other flavors more my son also tried it and did not care for it the orange tangerine flavors are masked by the other fruit juices and makes it taste odd i like the fact that has added vitamin c and is a healthy alternative to sodas but the flavor on this one needs tweaking 
negative,7/2/21,i was not sure what to expect with this citrusy fizzy drink it was okay though not something i would buy often and certainly not worth the price in my opinion it was not as orangey as i expected and it was not until i had half of it gone that i read the ingredient list and saw why orange juice is actually the fourth juice listed on the ingredient list with apple and grape juice first and second and the tangerine that seems to tone down the sweetness slightly the third on the list when you look at the nutrition information this product has about forty more calories than coke classic and despite not having any added sugar the grams of sugar in this product is more than an equivalent amount of coca cola the only bonus of this over real soda is the vitamin c and a there is not much else nutritionally to speak of 
positive,29/3/21,the can size is like a redbull drink s however its sugar content is grams attached is a photo of the nutrional facts in terms of its taste in my opinion it is quite tasty sweet a bit tangy and very orangish 
negative,17/4/21,the product says a twist because of carbonation well after pouring the drink over pieces of ice the carbonation was gone the carbonation is definitely light and does not last as far as the taste goes i did not care for the taste at all it left a bad after taste in my mouth i cannot recommend this product i will stick with regular juice at a much lower cost to be fair i gave it two stars because my wife thought it was ok 
positive,10/3/21,i like orange soda but usually cannot drink an entire can or bottle of sunkist or orange crush case because they are so sickly sweet this has just the right touch of natural sweetness and the tangerine gives a nice little tang to the orange flavor reminds me of the great orange sodas you can get in europe or specialty shops like orangina sparkling citrus beverage with natural pulp cans or san pellegrino aranciata pack bottles dare i say it yes the flavor and size make it a perfect mixer after my intial sip i immediately thought it would be great to fill up the rest of the glass with vodka 
negative,10/7/21,i was offered the opportunity to taste this product because of vine i would not normally purchase this type of product so my review and opinion will be biased in that regard i am not a big soda drinker i would just rather drink water or coffee i will occasionally drink a diet soft drink usually diet pepsi or diet coke did you know that a single can of coke classic has calories and grams of sugar this can of switch has calories and of sugar and this is healthy ounces less is size same caloric content and more sugar per ounce that classic coke ok so it is not added sugar but still that is a lot of sugar orange juice oz has calories and grams of sugar the can says it is orange tangerine but in fact the contents are water concentrates of apple grape tangerine orange and acerola juices then they throw in some gum acacia natural flavors and colors and some ascorbic acid vitamin c and as a little surprise bonus they have added soy soy i asked my wife to taste this product with me i poured the drink into two glasses and we both took a sip her reaction was swift and strong she hated it i agreed with her it was for me sickly sweet and left a sugary aftertaste in my mouth not only that but the taste was just nasty it did not taste at all like orange or tangerine to me it just tasted terribly sweet with an undefined cirtus something taste the carbonation did not add anything positive to the experience neither of us finished drinking our portion it went down the sink i would not purchase this product in the future and if i could have given it stars i would have it is that bad 
positive,27/1/21,if you want a quick pick me up that is not full of added sugar then this is a refreshing alternative to a soda the flavor is more heavily tangerine which only makes sense it is not overly sweet which is a good thing 
positive,1/6/21,i sampled a can of switch orange tangerine and found it to be a tasty beverage as advertised it is a balance between juice and carbonated with a light carbonation so it does not taste like orange crush or fanta but not like orange gatorade either the oz can has calories with a dv carb sugar content but vitamin c and vit a it is marketed as juice coming mostly from filtered concentrates no sugar added no corn syrup no preservatives no artificial colors gluten free if you are concerned with all that most important is that it tastes good and i would try it again 
positive,20/8/21,i will admit that i do not care for drinks that are carbonated the carbonation in soda makes me burp they tend to be too sweet or the diet drinks have a weird taste to them so i was not sure what to expect when i drank this to my surprise the carbonation is very mild it is more like a light buzz in your mouth instead of a lot of carbonation you will not hear the contents fizz when you drink this stuff the orange tangerine flavor is a nice combo stronger in the tangerine flavor than orange though as someone who does not like any sugar in my drinks i found it to be a tad sweet though it is advertised as no sugar added but less than i expected i am not sure when you would drink this though it is a small can and i cannot imagine someone who drinks cans of soda drinking one of these instead especially at the price they charge for this are they thinking that this will replace a glass of orange juice first thing in the morning overall i think it is tasty and if someone offered me one i would take it but it is not something i would buy 
positive,14/8/21,this is a mix of apple grape tangerine orange and acerola juices taste is obviously subjective and that can be seen in the reviews i like the flavor but will try to describe it rather than raving or ranting about it the tangerine is the dominant flavor however it is the taste of a very ripe tangerine or perhaps a clementine there is that slight alcohol or medicinal overtone to an otherwise good flavor i could see people not liking it while other do each can has grams of sugar vitamin c and vitamin a and not much else these are not nutrients that are otherwise hard to get so this is not necessarily a healthy alternative to regular soda on some level e g producing fruit instead of sugar cane it might be attractive to some 
positive,21/4/21,as part of amazon s vine program i received two trial cans of the switch black cherry and orange tangerine i tried both flavors cold over ice and rated them stars each although i prefer the orange tangerine flavor to the black cherry whether or not the switch is just right or not sweet enough for you will depend on your personal experience with carbonated juice drinks and soda if you are looking for the sweetness and fizz of a diet soda you will be disappointed these are juice drinks the orange tangerine flavor has calories and the black cherry has calories i recommend them as an alternative to regular juice to liven up your lunch or help you refuel after a workout either way you are getting of your vitamin c and there is no added sugar or corn syrup no preservatives and no artifical colors the black cherry flavor was too mild for me i was looking for more bite i could taste hints of the apple grape and acerola juice concentrates in the blend the flavor reminded me of blends i have tasted from treetop again the switch has a lot less carbonation than you would find in izze fortified all natural sparkling blackberry juice for example the orange tangerine flavor should be renamed the tangerine orange flavor to reflect the dominate taste and aroma the switch s blend is as flavorful as essn sparkling minneola tangerine juice or san pellegrino orange although again it is no where near as carbonated as those other brands in summary these all natural juice drinks are a healthier option than drinking a soda the switch also can help break up the monotony of drinking plain water and or juice after a workout remember to keep them the cans ice cold though preferably serve them on the rocks by the way if you are looking for a full flavored black cherry soda try thomas kemper black cherry soda which has calories per bottle there is a low calorie version as well but it is not available on amazon 
positive,1/4/21,i love the taste of this soda it is sweet with no bitter aftertaste that can be found in some orange sodas i would never guess this was a natural drink from the taste alone my only complaint would be the serving size it is correct for a serving size but not what i am used to in a soda can oz 
positive,17/4/21,the switch is marketed as of what you want of what you do not meaning the only things in the can are juice and carbonation there is no added sugar no corn syrup high fructose or otherwise no preservatives no artificial colors natural flavors and colors are added and no gluten the orange tangerine flavor seemed to taste almost like carbonated sunny delight according to the label the juice flavors are apple grape tangerine orange and acerola it was quite tasty and had just the right amount of carbonation almost like a soda that has been opened and left to sit for just a few minutes to let some of the excess gas escape it was light and dare i say refreshing for what it is marketed to be it does quite well the only downside is that i could probably do something similar at home buy some sunny d and add some sparkling water or seltzer and it would probably be cheaper however if you are out and about and need something light tasty and not loaded full of extra nonsense then this would certainly fit the bill 
negative,10/3/21,i drank a single can of the switch orange tangerine flavor today upon first impression the physical size of the can is a tiny or this in contrast to a regular can of soda size which is ounces or ml therefore only about the content of a normal can of soda to say the least this is not enough liquid for me in one sitting i need more to drink than that to quench a tiny bit of thirst so i was quite disappointed without even opening the thing up the taste of the drink itself was satisfying since there is no added sugar which is usually corn syrup in the us the flavor was not too sweet nor was it too bland however it was not anything like drinking a fresh bottle of natural juice more on the side of mixed syrup with water what kills this product is the high price product right now comes out to about a buck a can i would be angry paying that out of a vending machine for its small size but for purchasing in bulk it is an insult to say the least not worth the money 
positive,22/4/21,i drank this and could tell very little difference from a regular orange tangerine flavored soda which is quite impressive considering that this drink is made from juice it has calories and a great alternative to a regular soda i will definitely be purchasing these in the future i also tried their kiwi strawberry carbonated juice and enjoyed it as well 
negative,25/4/21,this is not orange and tangerine juice it is mainly apple and grape juice flavored with orange and tangerine and i really do not care about the vitamin c content vitamin c is easy to get what i do care about is that this is definitely the worst tasting soda of any type that i have ever tried i could not pour it down the drain fast enough 
positive,1/4/21,i realize that it is not quite healthy to guzzle oz canisters of liquid at a sitting but this switch orange tangerine flavored drink was so light and refreshing and tasted so natural that i could easily have downed another oz can or two and that is the only reason this drink did not receive five stars i wanted more and the little can was just not enough it is the perfect size for a child however so perhaps that who the drink is targeted for as an aside for those who prefer their beverages more adult oriented this orange tangerine switch would make an awesome mixer with gin or vodka cheers 
positive,30/6/21,i tried the black cherry version and liked it but this one is much better great orange taste plus the benefit of juice and no corn syrup sweetner for those worried about its use the carbonation helps make it a satisfying drink to quench thirst and the knowledge that it is healthy satisfies the mind as well 
negative,1/3/21,the switch orange tangerine looked very promising juice with some zippy carbonation i placed it in the fridge and let it get a nice chill hours later i popped the top and my wife and i sampled and it tasted like drinking furniture polish it is not like we we are searching for derogatory statements about switch here is how the conversation went wife takes a swig looks at me with eyes all googled yuck it tastes like furniture polish i take the can from her thinking she must be insane i chug some down ah yeah it does taste like furniture polish we poured the remainder down the drain if you enjoy drinking cold tangerine flavored furniture polish by all means by the way this drink left a nasty aftertaste still belching it up 
positive,29/1/21,these oz cans of switch keep their promise there are no added sugar no corn syrup and no preservatives it is a carbonated all natural juice like most of these juices drinks the ingredients state juice in this order filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates apple grape tangerine orange and acerola juice concentrates gum acaia natural flavors and colors ascorbic acid vitamin c and soy i was very surprised that this taste like a great tangerine soda each can has calories thanks i am swimming from mg of sodium of carbohydrates of sugar and of rda of vitamin c and of vitamin a i would be pleased to drink this sparkling orange tangerine flavored juice again i found it to taste good and be a refreshing drink but for my money i would rather by the izze fortified sparkling juice clementine ounce cans pack of brand of fortified sparkling juice that has a cleaner taste and fewer calories 
positive,17/4/21,i am always on the lookout for soda s that are made using real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup and fruit juice instead of chemicals switch s ingredients are filtered water apple grape tangerine orange and acerola juice concentrates gum acacia natural flavors and colors and ascorbic acid vitamin c it also says it contains soy so avoid it if you are allergic to soy one can contains vitamin c and vitamin a it also contains grams of sugar and it tastes like it the taste of switch is very similar to regular orange soda which includes the syrupy taste that orange soda has i personally do not like the syrupy taste and think this is way too sweet i can see kid s liking the taste however and it is a much better alternative to regular orange soda grams of sugar is a lot for ounces of a drink i would avoid it for myself but may use it as an occasional substitute for my kids 
negative,10/3/21,switch tastes more like chemicals than juice i was expecting something along the lines of orangina instead it is closer to orange soda but without the carbonation level that makes orange soda enjoyable for a small drink oz it is pretty high in calories frankly i do not think the flavor is good enough to justify the caloric level bottom line if you are die hard soda drinker this might be a better option for you if you are a die hard juice drinker stick to juice if you want fizzy juice add a little seltzer to your fruit juice 
positive,30/5/21,this orange tangerine juice bills itself as having of what you want and of what you do not want it is pure orange and tangerine juice with a bit of carbonation but no added sugar preservatives and carbonation of course that is all great but the big question is how it tastes i am pleased to be able to say it tastes pretty good it has a bit less zip than i usually prefer in my orange soda but a nice orange tangerine flavor and no noticeable aftertaste i would definitely try this again if i had the chance 
negative,28/9/21, ounces and a tad expensive is what i would say about this drink grams of sugar is also a negative for me i am not a sugar lover all in all not big enough to quench my thirst and not delicious enough to find me coming back for more natural but not that intensely citrus 
positive,6/5/21,i really enjoyed this drink the tangerine is very present and makes it very tasty this drink is natural and has no sugar added the carbonation makes it a bit like a soda but a lighter and healthier one i enjoyed it and i would definitely recommend it to others as an excellent alternative to regular soda 
negative,20/4/21,the only good thing was that it was not sweet but the taste was just bad i could understand and tolerate the taste if it was an energy drink but this is not an energy drink i have been very open and have tried different carbonated orange drinks and i have to say this is the least favorites of the other carbonated orange drinks i prefer just mixing carbonated water with orange juice 
positive,20/4/21,i am a big fan of avoiding corn syrup and a lot of the other ingredients that go into most processed foods and beverages these days so this beverage idea really sounded good to me it does not contain a bunch of artificial junk in it and it still tastes pretty good i could definitely drink more of these they will not ever be my favorite beverage but then i am more of a non carbonated kind of drinker anyway this is definitely a good alternative to other products out there and i would like to try other flavors as well 
positive,21/4/21,i was not sure what to expect with this but upon tasting it very chilled i have to admit it is pretty darn tasty to give you an idea of what it tastes like take orange juice give it the familiar bite of your favorite carbonated beverage add a little tangerine for a slight citrus aftertaste and there you go basically it looks and smells like orange juice but it tastes like orange pop should taste if it really tasted like oranges my wife said it reminded her of minute maid orange pop or as she would call it orange soda our four year old son is eager to drink pop because he sees mom and dad do it occassionally but we generally do not let him after reading the nutritional information on the can and seeing that there is no added sugar corn syrup preservatives or artificial flavors i can admit that i would have no problem letting him drink this instead of juice occassionally but not too often as it is quite a bit of sugar my wife made the observation that this drink would probably make a fantastic mixer for adult beverages sadly the sample we received was not enough to test this theory but it should make a really really good screwdriver 
positive,2/5/21,firstly i hate orange flavored sodas they all taste like ultra fake chemical laden floor cleaner to me switch is definitely not the case finally an orange soda that tastes like real oranges and tangerines who knew i thoroughly enjoyed this fizzy delight which reminded me of san pellegrino aranciata sparking beverage oz cans but sweeter this and all switch beverages are highly recommended 
positive,25/5/21,lana s snowflake black tea with coconut and almond has now become my favorite tea first the smoothness is unbeatable i found it a bit smoother than the hanley vanilla cormoro secondly the aroma changes from the time you smell it in the bag and then brew it is a great experience when you taste it you have a wonderful surprise of sweetness and comfort sort of a nutty caramel with vanilla notes it is the perfect dessert tea my husband lost lbs by drinking this instead of having ice cream now when you present it to friends let them taste it first if they go by the intense aroma in the bag it is so fresh some have wrongly thought it was too strong a flavor but it is not it is the amazing freshness they are not used to we served this at our wedding vow renewal and it beat out hanleys vanilla cormoro and paris too this tea has filled a gap i have had in my collection i have searched for a flavor like this over years lana please keep on creating this tea i am definitely coming back for more and thank you for tremendous and fast service by the way i am sipping this as i write yum smiles grace in vt
positive,7/9/21,since swanson s sun butter only contains roasted sunflower seeds and no other ingredients it is the only nut butter product we buy 
positive,25/5/21,just received this butter yesterday and we are already using it to make sandwiches with jelly tastes great without having any salt or sugar added highly recommend 
positive,22/5/21,this stuff is great i am allergic to peanuts just happened over night and i miss having a pbj so this is the next best thing to it truly this butter is all that and then some 
positive,19/7/21,i really like the fruity taste of this tea so much so that i can actually drink it without sugar if you like fruity teas you should try this product 
negative,7/9/21,i almost never write reviews but i thought i would for this one i am pretty open to tastes of anything but something about the smell and taste of this product was really bad it tasted off almost i am really disappointed because i had hoped to like it and i love fruity green teas but this was no good i would strongly recommend trying a sample of this if possible before buying sorry zhena s maybe i will like another flavor i have not given up on you yet 
positive,25/8/21,my vodka tonics have never been so refreshing i wish i would have ordered two cases now as my husband and i are going through far too much 
positive,6/9/21,this is by far the best tasting thing that is come from a goat in years bullsburg creamery man chowder dairy or goat coat cannot hold a candle to this stuff drink it bake it snort it it is all good 
positive,25/5/21,chrysanthemum tea taste great with lemons and apriva chrysanthemum tea is caffeine free that is great for pregnant women and those with high blood pressure 
positive,7/9/21,for coffee drinkers who buy maxwell house coffee this is a deal buy two cases for just over free shipping too seriously you know i stocked up 
positive,13/10/21,great product i purchased this product from our local fresh market i am a vegan and am always looking for different meat substitutes to try i used this mix to make some taco mince this stuff was perfect i even got my non veg father to try a bite of the tacos and he thought they were good as well that right there is saying something because my father is really iffy about mock meats i have another packet in which i am going to cook up today 
negative,2/10/21,i tried many teas and thought would try this kind saw it on dr oz show did not like its taste 
negative,23/9/21,i do not like sour taste and this has a sour kind of taste which i do not like the smell is not that great either
positive,26/6/21,i love to make sun tea with these tea bags it is very nice on a hot day to sit with a chilled glass it is tasty and not too sweet highly recommended 
negative,25/5/21,tasteless basically says it all i love tea drink it every day i found this undrinkable great packaging but not a good tea for me 
negative,7/9/21,i bought this tea because i had consumed the one from the bottle and i like that one however in tea bag is not just tasting totally and completely different but additionally tastes really horrible believe me i even tried to give it to my co workers for free after they tried it and they did not accept it in my opinion it tasted like serum s now i have tea bags wasting space probably soon they will go to the waste bascket it is sad i thought it would taste like the bottle or at least close but totally a disappointment 
positive,15/7/21,i went to a gourmet store and asked for their chocolate expert to recommend a chocolate among the high end makers he pointed out this brand which was affordable as well as incredibly flavorful if you need a chocolate to melt in your mouth savor the santander cocoa 
negative,3/6/21,in court as i understand it you are not supposed to testify about anything where you do not have direct experience you can discount this review if you want since i have only second hand experience with this soup i gave a case of this soup to a young friend who is a college student i worry about her starving she never mentioned whether she liked the soup so i asked she finally admitted that it was to quote her the worst thing i have ever tasted apparently her boyfriend also tried it and thought it was bad as well while my friend is rather picky her boyfriend has a much wider culinary range so if they both disliked the soup i am inclinded to think it is not very good 
positive,27/9/21,as far as noodles in a cup goes this is one of the best i have had actual recognizable small chunks of dehydrated veggies mostly mushrooms and onions that i could make out descent noodle quality and a very hot and spicy seasoning mix they do not show it on the picture here but i am pretty sure this is the hot and spicy cup it looks exactly like the one i just had but the words hot and spicy are just to the left of the symbol and are not visible in the pic if you like spicy noodles definitely do not pass this up very good
positive,19/6/21,compared to other egg proteins i have recently used this one is very sweet it is sweetened with splenda so still very low in actual sugar carbs i prefer to use an unsweetened version and put fruit in the blender with it to naturally sweeten it but my wife likes this one b c its easy to instantize in milk we use almond milk with a spoon no blender required 
positive,25/5/21,i really like this protein drink i am pregnant and trying to increase protein in my diet without adding a whole lot of extra calories or fat this is the perfect solution i usually mix it with a combination of plain almond milk and half water i also usually add a little more liquid than it says in the directions otherwise i find it too sweet the nice thing is that it is sweetened with stevia instead of a calorie filled sugar of some sort i prefer egg protein to other proteins because soy is often gmo and not recommended in high doses in pregnancy or for anyone actually and whey protein is a dairy product which i generally do not tolerate well egg protein is perfect for my needs 
positive,7/9/21,i like this product and i agree with any post who says it mixes well i bought a sample case just to test the waters and i do not feel bloated or anything after i drink it i think i feel my body is responding to it very well i am going to finish up the muscle milk protein because i bought it and i pay over for it lol but when i finish up the other proteins i purchase i am going to stick with egg white protein since i do not like eating them everyone taste buds is different some may like it some may do not then depending on your body chemistry some responds well to egg whites some do not but as for me personally i like it so far might try out the strawberry passion protein but the vanilla kind taste very good i would suggest this protein should be used for edurance athletes or people who are into calistenics such as push ups and pull ups 
positive,3/8/21,i bought these for my husband because he occassionally likes a cup of coffee at home and it is a hassle to drag out the coffee maker and grinder when he only wants one cup and it is not everyday it also comes in handy when guests come over because we do not tend to keep coffee in the house each serving comes in a little pouch that you can easily slip into your pocket briefcase or travel bag the flavor was rich and at around a cup much cheaper than going to starbucks or anywhere else and grabbing a cup on the way to work it dissolves completely leaving no grit or residue he first tried it in a ounce mug and found it to be a little strong but was perfect in his ounce travel mug 
positive,5/9/21,this is a great stand in when you cannot make it out to starbucks love having an instant version at home love love love it 
positive,25/5/21,bought a case to see what it was about i am a night owl which effects my day to day performance and father related tasks after a can i do feel mellow and finding myself going to bed much earlier 
positive,7/9/21,i love the fact that this is multi grain baby food but like people food good for you things never taste great so mix it with bananas or some other fruit yes the texture is a bit difficult to swallow for little ones hence why you want to thin it out i read the other reviews and cannot believe they never thought to mix this food with something else 
positive,11/9/21,we love this vegetable pouch for our month old and more importantly she likes it too i like that it has sort of a dry texture compared to basic blended vegetables i stir a touch of milk into it each time and it makes it really creamy she always finishes it and its one of our favorites 
positive,13/7/21,i ordered these as a gift in june they tasted great they did not arrive in picture perfect condition due to the heat but i was contacted by the company to see what they could do for me the strength of a company is not found in things that go correctly but rather in the things that go wrong and what they do about them i would recommend them highly
positive,22/7/21,very welcome addition to the kitchen cupboard these usda organic small black lentils westbrae brand come packed to the top in a ounce can and are ready to eat the ingredients are water organic black lentils and sea salt nutrition info is servings per container serving size cup or grams calories per serving fat trans saturated zero cholesterol zero sodium milligrams total carb grams dietary fiber grams sugars gram protein grams since beluga black lentils are said to have a higher protein content grams per serving you can see that these small black lentils are different from beluga i was glad to see that nice blue label on the website for heirloom beluga lentils glad to learn about them and would like to order them what i received from this webpage was small black lentils not beluga instead of belugas i received vegetarian organic black lentils not that i am sorry about it the can label has a wonderful recipe for soup and a vegetarian diet pyramid for nutrition these small black organic lentils are delicious and nourishing i recommend them to you to try and i would like an opportunity to order and try the heirloom beluga lentils as well sometime you will like the small organic black lentils many ways to serve them 
positive,22/6/21,we usually have fresh lemon grass tea at our local zen center it is extremely easy to make put a few blades of lemon grass in a pot to steep and you will get a fantastic tasting tea this tea is here is a fine replacement for when you cannot get fresh lemon grass lemon grass has many health benefits it is said to detoxify the liver and can lower uric acid levels this is important if you have gout because you get such a large quantity here on amazon it should last you quite a while caffeine free and light it makes a very refreshing afternoon tea give it a try thank you for reading my review 
positive,28/7/21,tazo sweet cinnamon spice tea is a very tasteful tea with no unpleasant after taste i am not sure what a person can say about tea but this flavor is one of the best i have ever had it makes great hot tea or iced tea it is pleasant flavor is a treat all by itself and is excellent without any sweetener some teas leave a bitter or strange after taste but this tea does not every cup is very special even if you leave the tea bag in your cup for a long time it never gets bitter wonderful product tazo sweet cinnamon spice herbal infusion tea caffeine free count tea bags pack of 
positive,13/10/21,not bad this tea does not taste like an oolong tea i am sure if they say it is oolong then it probably is an oolong but it really tastes more like a green tea it is also very mildly flavored i find it benefits from a longer brew time than recommended there is certainly no bitterness upon over brewing this tea as there would be with a black tea and the slight floral flavor and fragrance seems to be enhanced rather than harmed by this the flower bloom is durable i put an unfinished pot in the refrigerator overnight to try it as iced tea and the flower survived perfectly well without disintegrating if anything the tea benefited from the additional overnight brew served cold the flavor comes out even more if you are partial to iced tea the flower arrangement upon brewing is pretty nowhere near as pretty or as perfect as the pictures that numi shows on their website and it is as likely to bloom lopsided as it is to flower right side up some of them even bloom upside down do not expect perfection and you will be pleased with it 
positive,19/2/21,cannot find this or anything like it in our stores anymore good to know i can get it on here 
positive,14/12/20,excellent choice for a high fiber cracker these taste great and like other back to nature items do not have all the undesirable ingredients you would like to avoid if necessary whole wheat safflower oil salt and vitamin e perfect 
positive,14/12/20,my family loves the taste of these they are a bit high in sodium for my liking and for the price i wish they were organic i have purchased the heart to heart brand but they taste much staler and have a strange aftertaste compared to these crackers too bad because heart to heart has half the sodium 
positive,19/2/21,very closely resembles a triscuit cracker except there is no soy and a bit lighter you will not be disappointed with the taste and texture it is a quality cracker enjoy 
negative,10/1/21,this is a good decaf coffee but i have never before had a k cup dump the contents into my cup it is extremely irritating to deal with grounds in the cup and machine when deliberately choosing a system that avoids the mess 
negative,26/3/21,i am not a gourmet coffee critic but this stuff is disappointing based upon previous good reviews i suspect that the coffee in the k cups i received is not the same they may have changed the manufacturing the wolfgang puck decaf i received is lifeless watery and tasteless there is no aroma when it is brewing in the keurig never again 
negative,24/3/21,i tried this product solely for the fact it has wolfgang s name on it i should have stuck with timothy s brand this was way too strong to be labeled a breakfast coffee more like a dinner coffee i will not be buying this again also way too expensive compared to the others 
positive,24/2/21,i really enjoy wolfgang puck s k cups so far all the ones i have tried have not left my stomach churning and this was my first time trying out the sorrento fair trade roast and purchased it on a warehouse amazon price deal i am really happy with my purchase the taste of the sorrento is what i would expect of a medium roast a good smooth blend no bitter acidic after taste and leaves you wanting for more after that first cup at least it left me p it is does not leave you with the shhhakes either it has that right balance you need with your daily cup of coffee yes i will be getting another count of this when i am finished with this pack stars 
positive,19/2/21,my second purchase of this cofee like the first cup it has been wonderful to wake up to not too bold or brash but a good drink to start the day with
positive,14/12/20,this is a favorite in the office and in my house we burn through this coffee i have tried a few of the other wolfgang coffees and this one is by far the best i have seen better prices for this at a lot of other places this is an excellent coffee to start your day with 
positive,19/10/21,i bought a small pack of this locally and liked it so much i bought the pack great deal on amazon 
positive,18/5/21,i personally do not like strong coffee if you like weaker coffee then this blend is a great choice for you other reviews on here say that its too weak which is probably true if your used to something strong i also use flavored creamer to further enhance the taste for the price it cannot hurt to give it a try 
positive,19/2/21,i love sumatra coffee and was excited to receive these k cups however was disappointed when i opened my amazon box and found that the plastic wrap holding the two boxes of k cups was full of grinds meaning that there was a possible blowout of a cup after carefully unwrapping the boxes and attempting to get as little coffee grinds everywhere as possible i opened the first box and all cups were fine however the second box every kcup was covered in fine grinds and i had to clean each one and found that of the cups were defective due to the top being stamped on at an angle and the grinds had spilled everywhere i now see other reviews stating they had defective cups as well however the taste of the coffee is good 
positive,14/12/20,this is one of the best coffees i have ever had for my keurig it is a nice smooth coffee and the price is the best price i could find i will be buying more 
positive,1/6/21,very delicious coffee thankfully amazon sells this flavor now i have been waiting for it since i tasted this last year i like the fact that you sell it in a pack rather than a single 
positive,1/4/21,this k cup actually smelled up the office and it tastes as good as it smells i found it to be very flavorful 
positive,15/4/21,sometimes we have a problem ordering the k cups because they are way too strong for us even if you order medium blend this coffee was great just right it was a smooth blend and was perfect for a morning cup of coffee or anytime would definitely order again 
positive,19/5/21,i have tried about different k cup flavors and this is my favorite it has a wonderful aroma and just the right amount of hazelnut use the subscribe option and this is a deal that cannot be beat 
negative,19/2/21,i thought it had a bitter orange flavor however my husband and friend liked it 
positive,14/12/20,tried this for the first time this week and it is now my favorite coffee with a hint of flavor coconut full bodied and no after taste jamaica me crazy is just what i love for an afternoon pick me up or to wake up and have an immediate smile on my face seriously it is awesome highly recommended 
negative,28/7/21,i thought this coffee was really horrible had one cup and will throw the rest away because it cannot be returned 
positive,29/6/21,this k cup is one of my favorites along with coffee people s jet fuel and black tiger if you like a strong rich coffee this will fit the bill 
positive,15/10/21,even with the chocolate chunks these bars taste far less sweeter than most granola bars out there and i really appreciated that they have calories each and grams sugar which is less than kudos chocolate chip cal sugar or a cascadian farms chocolate chip granola bar cal sugar when i need a quick snack i can eat one with a glass of sparkling water and i feel full until the next meal if i need a quick meal i eat one of these with two string cheeses a large apple and water i can make it until dinner i would recommend these to anyone looking for a tasty and quick snack 
positive,20/7/21,i am doing the subscribe and save thing with these crackers i thought that it would take a while to get through the six boxes but boy was i wrong already we are halfway through the boxes time to order more 
positive,12/10/21,the crackers are very tasty and we just tried them out with a little salsa on top for a healthy low cal snack and my wife and i absolutely love them we will definitely get more once we run out 
positive,19/2/21,i would recommend this tea it has a fresh taste with an amazing acai grape flavor that i have not had before it also gave me energy which i can always use 
positive,14/12/20,this is oil is quite a good value compared to the grocery store prices we always keep a can in the refrigerator 
positive,2/7/21,this is an aromatic and tasty oil great on salads or for scrambled eggs i am sure i will find more uses for this as time goes on free shipping makes it a great deal my only nit pick is the lid two of the three bottles in the shipment had very tight lids that were difficult to open 
positive,11/3/21,i received a jar of this instant espresso as a gift from my mother in law i was quite insulted at first as i have never used instant coffee of any kind and could not figure out why she gave it to me then this past weekend i was out of coffee beans this was all i had must have coffee in morning so i made it wow it was awesome in fact i am drinking a mug of it right now as i right this review i love it however i make it in more of a latte fashion i have also added hot chocolate to it for a mocha latte i will definitely be looking for it at my neighborhood stores and if i cannot find it i will be getting it here on amazon definitely a great buy 
positive,10/4/21,i know nothing about this method of decaffeinating but thought i would give this a try i usually buy the swiss water processed this had a wonderful chocolatey taste it also claimed to be caffein free hopefully this is all true because it really is the best i have tried of decaf 
positive,22/7/19,when i read the reviews i noticed someone mentioned the box was light it is but it holds a lot these pork rinds are compact they expand when cooked so there is a lot more in the box than it looks like as snacks go these are high in protein and low in carbohydrate i think this is a really good value and these are very flavorful i especially enjoy them with bean dip the only thing that i would change is i would like a lightly salted version i do not always want that much salt 
positive,2/2/20,tasty spicy and good became quite the conversation piece at work no one have ever heard of microwave pork rinds before they tasted them and love them only draw back depending on type of microwave as to how they will cook 
positive,2/2/20,really easy to prepare and very yummy with my microwave i put them in for and they turn out perfect warm crunchy and tasty and without the carbs they do not impact your blood sugar which is a real boon for us diabetics 
negative,31/8/19,but the taste got sickening quite fast it also makes a really weird stench smell when you are microwaving it sometimes it would hurt my tongue when i am eating it all in all i threw the rest of them away after my bag it might just be me but i cannot say i would let the guests of my home try these so i cannot recommend them here to anyone 
positive,22/7/19,i have not had pork rinds in more than years and thought that this would be fun to try but i didn nt have high expectations microwave popcorn is pervasive and a proven success however i had never heard of microwave pork rinds and it was hard to imagine that it could really work as well as popcorn well it does i do not have much with which to compare the taste years ago however the texture and crispiness is just as i remembered i like spicy snacks and as another reviewer noted these are not especially spicy but i used a few shakes of cayenne pepper and that did the job it is very important to shake the bag in order to evenly distrbute the rinds throughout the bag before putting it into the microwave i have also found that mins seconds is the best time in my microwave oven to pop all of the bacon rinds i have eaten bags of the pork rinds and i love them they are light and crunchy and it is my experience that they pop better than popcorn and each bag is only carb 
positive,12/1/20,i bought these years ago at walmart and then they stopped carrying them i was searching the internet and found them at amazon we ordered a box of each i like the spicy and my husband likes the orginal a learning process will be a sure thing until you figure out how many minutes for your microwave they are great and we love them 
positive,19/2/20,i saw this product demonstrated on the food channel and knew i had to order it as i love pork rinds but the bagged ones are usually old and sort of stale or processed tasting follow carefully the directions with these for a spicy fresh and tasty snack every time yum 
positive,27/11/19,wow these are great i had them for the super bowl party and everyone just went nuts over this product great taste and just the right snacking size one word of caution follow the directions even though every bag i cooked was absolutely perfect it was evident if you get distracted they will burn real quick remember this product is not popcorn so there is no sound to help let you know its done again follow the directions they are fabulous 
positive,12/12/19,these microwave pork rinds are quite tasty for them to be cooked in the microwave my husband and i love the hot spicy flavor better than the plain because it has more flavor the only drawback i see to these is that if you have an older microwave or one that is not as powerful at least watts the pork rinds do not cook as well 
positive,26/9/20,these pork skins have a great taste very fresh homemade taste the cooking procedure can be a bit tricky though i have a microwave with a turn table and did not get the same results with each bag the first bag i tried with minute and additional second intervls stopping at seconds several skins had not yet cooked so i rolled the end of the bag back up and gave it more seconds still some did not fully explode or bloom the second bag i started with minute seconds slightly better results but again i needed to re roll the end of the bag and give it another seconds still using the second intervals for best results the third bag i started with minutes which is also the amount of time that is used on my popcorn setting and the results were not as good too many had over cooked and were too hard to eat my suggestion would be to stick with the minute with second intervals listening closely to the sound they emit a slight hissing sound when they expand as soon as the bag has fully opened and the hissing sound subsides it is a good sign you have reached the optimal result this item is a little more work than just picking up a bag of ready to eat at the store but the improved flavor is worth it to me anyway the jury is still out on whether the healthy claim can hold water i will continue to use restraint and only endulge with this treat on occassion good eats 
positive,22/7/19,we originally found these at wally world when we could no longer get there i hit the internet both are quite good we prefer the spicy 
negative,2/2/20,i normally rate whatever items i buy but rarely offer words of advice well these things changed my mind i love pork rinds usually i buy a tub of them from sam s but since i am the only one in the house who eats them they go stale long before i can make a dent in them so i saw these and the positive reviews and thought hey that is the perfect solution it is a perfect solution all right a perfect solution to get me to stop eating pork rinds i made the first bag as per the directions i had no problem with them crisping at all they were perfect in that regard nice and crunchy but the taste is awful i thought perhaps it was a bad bag nope the second batch tasted just as terrible i have no idea what they use to flavor them but it tastes like a strange mixture of salt and soap there is enough salt in them to kill a horse which in and of itself would not be so bad i actually like salty things but when combined with whatever garbage they dug out of their backed up shower and called seasoning it left me hunting for listerine or gasoline whatever i could get my hands on to get the taste out of my mouth i am still shuddering from it if you like the taste of feet go for it if not i would suggest heading to sam s to buy the wonderful tasting pork rinds we all know and love 
negative,23/5/20,so i made one bag of these pork rinds it came out good i decided to try another the taste was unbelievable it had an ammoniated taste smell to it i thought that maybe it was a bad bag i stayed away for a few weeks decided to give them another try bad idea they tasted like ammonia again this was not caused by incorrect cooking time because they all came out looking puffy and crispy i ended up throwing the box out 
negative,22/11/20,i got these for my dad from his wish list he thought they would be spicy and flavorful but they just tasted like cumin and had a funky smell the box came with individual bags but after you open one bag it is impossible to even want to put yourself through that again they are nasty avoid them at all cost yuck 
positive,30/3/20,a delicious product cannot seem to find it in the stores these days i recommend to try if you like pork rinds quick delivery and great to have for guests 
positive,8/7/20,if your a pork rind lover this is an awesome product for those wonderful taste buds they melt in your mouth before they go down mmm mmm good 
positive,4/1/20,it cooks in microwave so fast and it is really good right after you cook but unfortunately it has message in it nonetheless the fat and sodium content on this is not too bad when compared to regular pork rinds i uploaded a photo of the nutrition facts so you can see the ingredients too 
positive,30/1/21,if you enjoy pork rinds like i do you cannot miss this product a minute and a half in the microwave and you have got warm crunchy deliciousness there is just the right amount of spice too this is a great product 
positive,2/11/20,i found microwave pork rinds quite by accident but ever since they are something i have wanted now i found them on amazon and i could not be happier it is a quick easily prepared snack and as other reviewers have pointed out not bad for your diet once they come put of the microwave open the bag pour them out and marvel as you hear them still popping and crackling in the bowl i may never go back to bagged pork rinds ever again
negative,17/10/20,for a microwavable chili this stuff and the firehouse variant do taste good however i never get to eat the full container because it tends to explode in the microwave i have followed the directions exactly on the label as well as tried some tweaking and nothing so far has prevented it from exploding the problem is the plastic lid that is to be left on it is left on because it is vented but covers the chili to keep it from splattering irony is there is not enough venting the chili plugs the holes and as it boils and water vapor expands it basically becomes a messy bomb in your microwave i wish i could say it was user error and that there is a way to enjoy this without the mess so far the firehouse variant has not exploded on me but it also has less meat and beans to it since the firehouse variant is not really all that spicy i may just stick with that until campbells can make this not a bomb 
positive,22/7/19, stars on taste beef tastes like it was grilled before it was added to the chili the only thing that concerns me is the grams of sugar that cannot be good for you 
positive,2/2/20,this chile was surprising good and not overly salty or processed tasting actually a good light and tasty lunch 
positive,4/10/20,the amita peach nectar is a very tasty natural fruit drink that is loaded with sugar so if you are looking for an alternative to orange juice and can tolerate the calories you might want to give this drink a try also it makes a nice ingredient in mixed alcoholic beverages such as peach bellinis 
positive,1/4/20,tastes great and it is a quality product at a price a few dollars cheaper than the alternatives even at our local supermarkets it is tough to find grade a medium amber syrup in pints i will probably just keep ordering these a few times a year 
positive,8/5/20,this is one of the few teas that i will always have on hand it is a wonderful blend of beneficial herbs that has a great taste i drink it almost every day 
positive,18/6/20,i saw this tea from my friend s room and asked for a couple she has the super slimming tea and the detox tea i usually combine the two it made me go to the bathroom more frequently than usual but i feel much relieved like more refreshed my pimples went away and my back acne is non existent the store in my area stopped selling this kind of brand sucks i have to purchased it on line now 
positive,20/8/20,these are my favorites and i have reordered more than once perfect for desert without all the calories and is soooo good cannot find these locally so go to amazon for my candy fix 
positive,1/6/21,nature s path makes some excellent cereals and this is definitely one of them i really enjoy it because it has great flavor a good crunch and is a very healthy food in fact this is my favorite cereal hands down i totally recommend buying the pack of a penny saved is a penny earned besides it is not like the cereal is going to go bad it will keep for months until you break the seal 
positive,4/7/21,i recieved the delivery quicker than i thought i would i was concerned with how the food item would be packaged the gyro slices were still frozen when i recieved them the gyro slices were delicious they taste better than most of the restaurants i frequent 
positive,5/2/20,excellent product great taste perfect portion only calories in a bag i microwave it for and it comes out perfect each time fills a medium tupperware bowl and it was an very good value only for boxes shipped only cents for each bag 
positive,22/7/19,i was placed on a severly restricted sodium diet three years ago and one day at my local market happened upon this product it was like i finally had stepped back into the world of taste if you have ever read nutrition labels on soups you know a sodium restricted diet does not allow for the vast majority of them so now i can have a healthy organic warm bowl of comforting soup whenever i like and if i purchase it through amazon by the case shipping is free making it a lot less expensive then my local market give it a try 
positive,2/2/20,i am on a low sodium diet and this still has plenty of taste without salt
positive,22/11/20,since i have to watch my sodium i have looked for a very low sodium soup for quite awhile campbell s made one but no longer does if you had tried theirs this one is far tastier and better 
positive,1/3/20,this was a great sampler of green coffee to roast i have not tried them all yet but i liked the variety of regions and it really was a great product for a great price 
positive,23/11/20,taken is taken but after you have a lot of different kinds you tend to establish a taste favorite basically if the price is good go for it 
positive,5/4/21,this grain is an excellent substitute for rice it only takes two cans of chicken broth to one package of quinoa to make a lot of very tasty and filling finished product which can be used with gravy sauce mixed vegetables or anything you like 
positive,27/4/20,ok folks listen up for special occasions we will spend the big bucks and get a rack of lamb you are lucky today if you can even find it in the stores it is so expensive often at per pound so the very last thing you want to do after spending all that money is ruin it with the wrong flavoring colorado spices new zealand lamb rub has the right blend of herbs that goes well on just about any meat we just used it on some fresh bluefin and yellowfin tuna and it was fantastic my year old mother who cooks every day and is not a huge spice fan she is used to plain new england cooking loves and uses the rub on chicken lamb and fish she is having me order another case and loves the individual packets as the rub does not lose its taste or flavor and stays fresh this is a great product 
positive,8/3/21,i have never had any hot chocolate that tastes better than this not homemade not from starbucks not from swissmiss this is hands down the best i have ever had i go through so much of this stuff because whenever friends come over they go straight for it but what happened to the price most k cups run from about but amazon has these things going for even bed bath beyond has them cheaper than that bring the price back down to something reasonable and your star review will return 
positive,30/1/20,this is a fantastic soy based product that is not too sweet is very smoothe and wonderfully chocolaty i highly recommend this 
positive,22/7/19,my year old loves to make a cup of this before school every morning the cocoa tastes wonderful and brews up nice we add a splash of milk to cool it off and it is so good i do not taste anything artificial in fact the quality is great we will bring this camping for the younger kids with the powders we always had clumps this brews a great cup every time and tastes like the expensive coffee shop stuff 
positive,2/2/20,the local auto shop offers this free to it customers i have tried it twice and liked it both times perhaps if i had to pay for it i might not love the price but i would still enjoy the flavor 
positive,2/9/20,our beloved bengal kitty isabel is years old and suffering from kidney stones which are inoperable in felines for years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health declined our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she would eat she might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years so we offered her one soft food after another she turned up her nose at the expensive vet sold brands and repeatedly rejected one national brand and flavor after another finally to her gustatory delight and our great relief she made her choice this particular wiskas version is the only kind she will eat day in and day out it must be whiskas with the turkey and giblets in gravy the gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she cannot resist we surmise that like humans our pets have food preferences linked to palate pleasing aroma and taste this whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our izzy no it is not the best choice for managing kidney stones but she is got to eat so you will not worry that we are ignoring her renal problems she is on daily medication and is doing quite well it is not an inexpensive cat food but its packaging is very convenient and space saving the amazon auto ship program is a life saver the cartons always arrive on time and the per package bulk rate is lower than the price of small quanities also our local target was the only place we could find this exact variety and now the store no longer carries it remember our cat demands giblets and gravy and accepts no substitutes give autoship a try the price is better and you can easily adjust the quantity and frequency of shipment or cancel altogether 
positive,26/1/21,great cheese wonderful flavor made my spaghetti meatballs better than it is ever been made the lasagna even better fast delivery 
positive,9/1/21,i recommend using half water and half skim milk i usually mix oz water with oz skim milk and heat in the micro for two minutes add the packet and sugar or sweetener great for a quick cup of coffee without the hassle of cleaning the machine 
positive,30/7/21,this honey granules is tasty and a welcome alternative to cane sugar i use it in my morning oats steel cut oats bird s custard and tea one or two teaspoonfuls go a long way it is better stored in the refrigerator consider it in place of over processed store bought cane sugar 
positive,30/10/20,i am a peanut butter fanatic and i get excited every time amazon offers a bulk order of peanut butter at a low price i use peanut butter as a mid day energy boosting snack straight off the spoon and without any other food to supplement it it is just that good to me i was more than happy with skippy reduced fat creamy i like the smooth texture it has and it has a great mouth feel that is not the thick stick to the roof of my mouth kind that requires a glass of milk to be able to eat i do not feel that skippy reduced the flavor from its original peanut butter along with the fat to make this product it tastes delicious and satisfying if you are a peanut butter lover like me please look out for the fantastic prices amazon has on skippy reduced fat creamy you will not regret buying it and the reduced fat intake is a bonus 
positive,3/8/20,this is the first redued fat peanut butter that i have thought was a good peanut butter i will buy it again when this is gone 
positive,29/1/21,this pb tastes good and is goood for you it makes good sandwiches i only wish it were in stock more often 
positive,24/10/21,hemp foods are great the slightly nutty taste is always something i enjoy i almost rated this item four stars because it does not have a strong hemp seed taste but after some thought it is probably best that way i add a bit of brown sugar and one packet will fill me up not true with most other oatmeals 
positive,24/10/21,great taste almonds are high in overall fat but low in saturated fats that most contribute to weight gain buy a case they stay pretty fresh when sealed for months
negative,16/10/21,there are several types of teas in the world indian ceylon scented teas like jasmine there is oolong black green but one thing binds all these teas together they taste like tea this substance has no flavor only an astringent quality it is not drinkable plain which i suppose is why people require all sorts of recipes adding sugar or spices anything to give this tea some flavor and take away the horrid bitterness i think it is even worse than the bagged lipton tea if that is possible in the bagged tea they do not put dust in the teabags because it would fall right out of the bag but since this is loose tea lipton saw fit to add dust twigs anything but the actual leaves what should you drink anything you like i suggest browsing this site called the english tea store no affiliation just to get an idea about what types of teas it is possible to purchase i astounds me that anyone could drink this substance and call it tea it is not tea it is particles of bitterness dust pieces of twigs black and tasteless leavings of what used to be a tea plant what the hell is wrong with you people to drink this stuff by the way i have nothing against some lipton tea but when you drink this stuff you need to add lemon sugar or cream something because it is awful stuff trying to drink it on its own if you have to buy tea at a supermarket try the twinings darjeeling that is a decent blend you can drink 
positive,24/10/21,if you like a strong but smooth flavorful coffee this is it i have tried others and just keep coming back to this one my second joice would be the starbucks italian blend 
positive,25/9/21,i am on a gluten free diet and find most gluten free snack high in calories and fat these cookies are awesome the serving size is cookies calorie count per serving is between and and fat is between and great flavor and crunch and almost healthy 
positive,19/10/21,what is not to like delicious smokehouse almonds in the perfect size package i keep them in my locker at the gym for a post workout snack they are very smokey do not leave an open package in your car like i did it made my car smell like cigarettes however this is unlikely to happen as it is hard to only eat part of the package as they are so good 
negative,20/10/21,these were fair i do not feel they are aa quality would not repurchase 
positive,19/10/21,very beautiful and added a wonderful appearance to some of our christmas cookies tasted good as well with no bitter or chemical flavor a good alternative to all the frosting that is popular these days on cookies 
positive,15/6/21,i switched my cat to halo s salmon indoor formula and have noticed a marked difference in her coat and reduced smell from the litter box cats are snobs when it comes to food switching them to a new food takes at least a week more if you have a picky eater like me start small and work more in each day if you moved from a diet of raman noodles to a high protein high fiber diet instantly you would not want to eat it either you get what you pay for when you buy food for yourself or your pet 
negative,4/8/21,first of all the tea is gross it tastes nothing like bubble milk tea secondly the seller must know this product is less than expected because they sell it in incriments of two bags now i am stuck with two bags of this junk i want my bucks back 
positive,4/8/21,as other s have mentioned this is available in other stores for much cheaper so i recommend to shop around before buying on amazon when it comes to the actual product i highly recommend buying this if you own a keurig you are able to discretly hide so many of the keurig cups the carousel is a neat product but when you do not have counter space it just does not work this unit is pretty great quality but i do find that it is tough to slide sometimes the material that they use on the top of the tray makes sure that your keurig does not move at all highly recommend that you pick one up whether it be from bbb or amazon 
positive,18/7/21,i eat these cookies frequently using the subscribe method the nutrition provided is high quality i recommend all the erin cookies for a snack or meal 
positive,18/10/21,i am surprised by how good this breakfast cookie s flavor is it has depth of spices and textures and is truly delicious calories seemed a bit high but i ate one with a large glass of water and it has been hours and my tummy is not growling yet i even worked out too i love that it does not have any freaky ingredients and it was very soft and moist i gave a little pinch of it to my toddler daughter and she enjoyed it too i prefer to have actual oatmeal in the morning with fruit and yogurt but these breakfast cookies are great if the morning goes sideways and i do not have time or opportunity to fix something the problem i found with other protein bars and such is that in about hours i was feeling peckish and looking for snacks until lunch i did not have that problem with this breakfast cookie it may have more calories than i thought i wanted to spend but it is very worth it since it keeps me out of the kitchen until lunchtime another nice thing there are not any chips or icing on this cookie to melt in the mid day heat so you can keep one of these in the purse or diaper bag without creating a big mess for yourself later i keep them in the freezer for freshness they are really moist and chewy once you let them thaw or microwave i put one on a saucer and nuke for seconds from frozen solid it turns out like its warm from the oven i do not recommend keeping them in the fridge baked goods and bread will get dried out if kept there update i have lost pounds in the last year with very minimal changes and these cookies have helped me go from not eating breakfast and snacking all morning to eating breakfast no matter how busy and not needing to snack or eat until lunchtime they are very filling and are perfect for when you do not have time to make anything 
positive,15/6/21,so far have tried two flavors this and oat raisins and prefer the other better this flavor tastes a little bland compared to the other for some reason even though it has more ingredients but it is not inedible or anything just a little bland as for whether it helps you feel full i would say it does not for me because it is just a size afterall and i am used to eating a lot more but i always skip breakfast so eating this is better than nothing considering studies show breakfast is the most important meal of the day eating breakfast also helps you lose weight and raise metabolism i would give the taste stars but bought it for amazing cents each cookie so price gets stars which average out to stars 
positive,4/8/21,i first purchased erin baker s breakfast cookie in the caramel apple flavor while it was tasty and very fulfilling i was not forsure if i was in love with them and really why waste your time eating something you do not love so based on customer reviews i then tried the morning glory breakfast cookie i loved the bits of nut and i have to say it is tasty and fulfilling it is my favorite cookie and i easily give them a star rating i again began browsing the cookie flavors and spent time reading customer reviews and decided to try the peanut butter chocolate chunk and all i can say is third times the charm these breakfast cookies are knock your socks off delicious i plan on stocking up so that i do not have to order over the hot summer months as i have read on some of the cookie reviews that because these cookies are so fresh and have no preservatives to prevent spoilage that they are prone to mold if left out to long so i figure why take the chance i am just going to make several purchases before summer gets here i totally recommend these breakfast cookies my only wish is that they came in a variety box so one is not forced to purchase a whole pack to sample one flavor yes they are a little high calorie so you might not want to use them as a snack but for a meal replacement they are fantastic i love the natural ingredients and i know these cookies are fresh makes you wonder how fresh those meal replacement bars are that sit on the store shelf for months 
positive,8/6/21,these cookies are tasty but just a little too gooey and the calorie count is for one cookie this is a bit high 
positive,15/6/21,this has recently become my staple breakfast cereal after trying many high on taste low on nutrition cereals i decided to find one that fits my needs i am a regular at the gym so i have to watch what i eat this one is not only high in protein and fiber but also tastes much better that the other similar cereals with high fiber it can easily become addictive as it has the right balance between taste and nutrition the price is affordable too and the product can be easily found in grocery stores 
positive,4/8/21,sustainably caught off the california coast packaged as disclosed in a previous review i feel a tad guilty buying at at time at the local co op but they are simply the best tasting sardines distinctive and flavorful you know you are buying premium product compared to the plethora of sardine purveyors out there nordic portugal mediterranean etc the cool waters off the california are well known for sardines
positive,25/9/21,just had a can of these and wanted to confirm the great quality of this product excellent taste and three big sardines barely fitting into the can i will get more 
positive,19/10/21,i love this coffee it has very good flavor for decaf i have been looking for a good decaf coffee because i have been trying to give up caffeine and this is the best one i have found so far 
positive,4/9/21,i looked a long time for dark roast decaf that tasted like this one does the package does not say where it is grown but it tastes like columbian beans to me i hope amazon keeps handling it great coffee gerald
positive,31/8/21,great product our dog is loving a tasting treat that is good for her year old bones
negative,9/10/21,i have tried several different types of sugar free chocolates and this is one of the worst instead i recommend the dove dark chocolate and the russell stover coconut 
positive,15/6/21,i like these they are not gas producing and they hold shape ok for canned beans flavor is good love that they do not have added salt 
positive,4/8/21,i bought these on super sale because i needed them for a pie crust and they were cheap i got the pack and was at first dismayed to find that they were not packed like other graham crackers are usually packed they were loose in a bag not stacked in bricks to fill the box this meant there were many less per box than i had anticipated but when i tried one i was immediately impressed they taste fantastic these taste nothing like the kind of graham crackers we were fed in kindergarden they have actual flavor and are much more than just an ingredient or child s fare what these lack in volume they make up for in quality i immediately ordered three more packs while they were so cheap i have a toddler at home and am happy to supply us all with these wonderful graham crackers they do not have any scary fillers or ingredients they are made with butter and not trans fat and you can snack on nine of them with your coffee for only calories not bad they also make a pie crust that is noticeably better than what i used to make dessert crusts with i was so impressed at what stonewall kitchen could do to a graham cracker that i am going to check out other products they make 
positive,15/6/21,this tastes great at first it tastes a bit strange but i enjoyed the slight coffee taste i mixed the amazing green superfood the chocolate version with it which made the amazing green taste much better i need to buy more of this hemp shake since i am out it really makes the amazing green taste much better i mix it with milk using a little wisk which works well i recommend this to anyone trying to be healtheir boost their immune system and it is a great snack try both the products together it is a great combination i have been using it regularly for a few months now and i have noticed that i have stayed healthy i even managed to go to disney world during the new year holiday without getting sick as a teacher getting sick is common for me but i have noticed that i have been healthier since using these products give it a try 
positive,4/8/21,i agree with the others that say this is one of the best hemp shakes out there i started off with the original nutiva hemp powder and once i finished that i decided to try the chocolate it is amazing it is much easier for me to gulp this down in the morning i mix it up in a blender bottle also sold on amazon with a little water and some type of milk i really like mixing it with vanilla hemp milk or whole grain rice milk but regular milk works fine too nutiva is the least grainy hemp shake i have come across yet i have tried several kinds and even though i can drink them i much prefer nutiva over any other 
positive,15/6/21,originally tried this because it was on sale and i figured that even if it was gross i would only be out a buck happily it tastes great mainly have used it in coffee and tea just ordered my second box 
positive,4/8/21,how nice it is to no longer be deprived of pasta and noodles if you follow a low carb lifestyle then house foods shirataki tofu noodles are heaven sent i have been enjoying this product for well over a year and i am so very happy to have found it i heard about it on the dr oz show and ran right out and bought some i have tried the fettucine and spaghetti noodles also but the angel hair is the most versatile people who found them too rubbery probably did not follow the package directions for best results they have to be thoroughly rinsed and parboiled for at least three minutes i am also amazed at how forgiving this product is once i got distracted and let the noodles simmer for almost minutes and they still turned out fine maybe even better if you want that ramen like flavor do this after parboiling and drying saute them over high heat in a skillet with peanut oil and or sesame oil or hot chile oil add a few shakes of salt onion garlic powder and toss then just carry on with your recipe they are very much like rice noodles so you will not miss a beat with stir frys and noodle soups i have also had great success with italian dishes i have used them with meatballs or italian sausage in marinara sauce also with shrimp scallops in a cream wine sauce just to name a few topped with grated melted cheese i got all of the joy and practically none of the carbs however one package really only serves one this is an excellent healthy alternative to pasta and noodles that will not wreak havoc upon your glycemic index good cooks will have no problem incorporating this into their menu planning 
positive,1/10/21,i cannot recommend this company enough i always receive my pepsie s within two days the price is far less than i pay for it here plus i get it delivered to my door 
positive,1/7/18,great flavors and crunchiness sometimes gluten free food can be bland but these are really flavorful this is also a great buy if you compare only buying one bag of these to the variety that you get 
positive,10/8/18,this salt is so good you could almost eat it plain i am telling you sprinkling this with your fingers onto salads chicken fish is amazing definitely do not waste this by cooking it where you could use regular salt this salt needs to be tasted as it really brings out the flavour of food in a really beautiful way this is meant to be sprinkled on foods after they have cooked roasted chicken for example or on raw vegetables like tomatoes or cucumbers this is the foodie s salt now i have noticed this salt is easier to buy in the regular grocery stores so if you can buy it there where it is cheaper to do so 
positive,1/7/18,i bought these to share with the office and the disappeared almost instantly they are very good and contain enough protein to keep people going while suppressing that snacky feeling these are a great snack to carry with you as they are very light for example on a flight or road trip i highly recommend that you try a few of the other flavors as well they have this snack in chicken turkey and beef in various flavors 
positive,10/8/18,we have been looking for a cracker for our daughter whom we have just put on the gfcf diet the glutino cracker is about as close to a normal cracker that we have come across the rest of us who are not on the diet even think these are good they have a yummy buttery and salty taste to them we bought them here on amazon com in a case of boxes for very reasonable highly recommend to anyone on the gfcf diet who misses their crackers makes a nice snack to pack in the car for road trips or flights 
positive,13/9/18,i bought this product for my son who is in grad school he said emeril s k cups were the best tasting ones he has tried so far i will definitely buy them for him again 
positive,17/7/18,tried a new coffee recently and have to say that emerils gourmet coffee was just what i expected a dark bold flavor that i love 
positive,16/1/19,i am a coffee fanatic drink it day and night no coffee does not keep me awake i am enjoying the flavor of emerils bold when i got my keurig it came with a sample pak and in it were two samples of emerils coffee i immediately went to amazon to see if i could order larger amounts than at the keurig site i am so glad i did as yes amazon had larger paks at a very reasonable price this will become one of my repeat orders in the future 
positive,16/1/18,we love this product our baby is months old and we are introducing new foods to her so far she has tried the pumpkin and she cannot get enough she grabs for the spoon we love that this product is organic and that use can use breastmilk to mix so your baby gets added nutrients it is portable compact and you can take it anywhere if at a restaurant or away from home simply warm up your milk and combine it is really fantastic 
positive,16/1/19,if you used to buy old el paso refried beans with sausage and liked that product which they do not produce anymore this is the next best thing i tried these and they are very good better than any home made stuff i tried to do i tried special ordering with my local grocery but they said they could not get the product in and amazon has a better price than the website for latin products i would definitely recommend this product and will purchase again 
positive,1/8/20,pamela s makes some of the best tasting cookies i have ever had i have never tasted a bad product from this company all the cookies are great but this one is my favorite of all time they are moist chewy and a much healthier choice than most other cookies on the market so if you are on a diet or not if you are sensitive to wheat or not these taste great i look forward to the day that pamela s expands their product line 
positive,1/7/18,i love pineapple juice and drink it every day fresh is the best but this is surprisingly good i usually keep some on hand for convenience it is so much better tasting than the stuff from concentrate the price on amazon is kind of high though i find it is cheaper just to stock up at our local grocer 
positive,10/8/18,this orzo is absolutely great this is the first time i have eaten it and it blends beautifully with vegetables i love salads and this is the way i used the orzo orzo salad cup orzo red and green pepper amount you want onion amount you want celery amount you want yellow squash amount you want black beans drained and washed white shoepeg corn drained and washed tlbs red wine vinegar tlbs of olive oil packet of splenda salt and pepper to taste bring enough water to boil that will cover the orzo about and inch over the top add the orzo to the boiling water and salt to taste boil for to minutes do not overcook chop the veggies and add the corn and black beans drain the orzo run cold water over the pasta and add to the veggies mix the vinegar olive oil and one packet of splenda together salt and pepper to taste drizzle over the veggies and orzo mix well will keep well to days in the ref tip you can subsitute any vegetable you prefer as peas cauliflower broccoli carrot etc 
positive,15/2/20,very nice product for those wanting to enjoy the pleasure of lasagna but are on a gluten free diet great alternative 
positive,22/4/21,this is very good maple syrup but like most pure maple syrup it is very expensive my husband and i duped ourselves when purchasing this product we did the math wrong and though that we were paying about for a half gallon rather than only oz man was i surprised to see how small the jug was when it came in the mail 
positive,25/9/20,i really like the pamelas products whenever bars they have a chocolately coconut taste and not too sweet which is great only grams of sugar it is filling and i would order these in the future 
positive,16/11/19,these are actually pretty good i was not expecting to like them i do not like chocolate and coconut together but i did they are soft and chewy and great for a snack they are wheat gluten and dairy free so they are pretty good for those with allergies or food sensitivities each bar has calories which is pretty standard they do have calories or grams of fat of which are saturated the rest of the contents are pretty good with of sugar and of whole grains the ingredients are all things you can pronounce and has none of the weird chemicals the bar is pretty chewy and tasty i liked it and may even buy them 
positive,9/9/20,these bars are a perfect healthy snack for satisying a sweet tooth they are moisty chewy and just sweet enough they do not contain corn syrup and you will not miss the wheat or dairy 
positive,1/7/18,this snack was tasty and seemed to be healthy however i would not rate it as being special or see myself making it a go to energy bar right now i prefer clif bars and powerbars 
positive,10/8/18,every pup i have ever owned loved these treats they will do anything for them and only like this brand i tried another and they refused to eat them if you love your pups and treat them like children buy these mine are not too spolied diva and tiffany they get them every holiday and i am never without a supply on hand try greenies too 
positive,15/1/20,forget cheetos these are the best ever same price or less if on sale and better for you i could eat a bag by myself but the kids beat me to it 
positive,1/9/20,i was able to try these chips from a food show sample and i fell in love they taste great plus they are much healthier than the average chip definitely recommend this product let us get these in stores 
positive,22/7/21,my parents love this stuff and they are actually asians so that speaks volumes it is such an easy quick convenient food to stock up for them for whenever they drop in to visit me and i have not nothing but white people food lying around but i am sure that it will go a long way toward feeding the starving college student types as well i think that it is a perfect combination of flavor for price but i have to admit that i would not purchase this item at amazon as it is far more affordable if you buy from an asian grocery if you found this review helpful please let me know 
positive,1/7/18,i had this for lunch and i enjoyed the flavor and the spice level it was a little salty for my taste but not too bad some people suggest not to use the whole flavor packet to reduce the saltiness but that would also reduce the amount of heat the bowl was easy to prepare and it was enough for me for lunch given the hagh salt content and low nutritional value i would eat this occasionally not often to satisfy a craving 
positive,10/8/18,bought this in the maui costco and thought it tasted so great we dragged home the unfinished huge bag of oatmeal went to our local costco and they did not sell it but another type of cut oatmeal which is not nearly as good and a different texture this is a fine tasting healthy oatmeal 
positive,14/5/21,one of my favorites hopefully this continues at a reasonable price each k cup brews perfectly well pleased will continue to order as long as it is a suscribe and save item 
negative,17/10/19,i have fgound the cure for drinking too much coffee inthe morning get this one i thought when i first had this that i had accidently wiped the sugar spoon with a mr clean cloth but the next day i had one cup of tully s and made the second cup the green mountain breakfast blend the disinfectant taste was back i would not buy this one again 
positive,3/10/21,i love this coffee it is my favorite so far i want to try them all i do not like strong coffee and i hate bitter after taste coffee to me this is the perfect cup of coffee i am not telling everyone to go out and buy it this is my own opinion 
positive,15/9/20,this is the food my vet recommends it is produced about or miles away from where i live and they source only local ingredients nothing comes from china so it is a food i feel very comfortable with i know that this company cares about my pet s health and takes it seriously and it is very reasonably priced at one of my local pet food stores now there are those who would point to the oats and vegetables and declare it unacceptable but my cat never throws up or has diarrhea with eagle pack he seems to do best on the lamb variety and the duck variety the turkey one gave him slightly softer stools for some reason i think the price and quality make us both happy for now i would love to feed him the optimal diet probably raw but i still have some reservations about it that i would have to come to terms with so for now we are sticking with this 
positive,30/8/20,for someone with a gluten problem this is the best spaghetti on the market without a doubt 
positive,1/7/18,how much can you say about a drink it tastes pretty good it is got a nice flavor sweet but not overly so and there is a good amount of fizz there is a lot of sugar for the amount of drink you have and at only fluid ounces there just is not much there what is there is good though 
positive,10/8/18,this is a good drink tastes like soda but fruity i really liked it nice alternative to soda 
positive,5/12/19,this is very good a nice berry flavor with just a hint of kiwi and very sweet even with no added sugar the fruit flavors are strong but very natural without the unpleasant mouthfeel and aftertaste some fruit beverages can leave you with the carbonation is nice it is not too bubbly but just pleasantly effervescent this is a product i would definitely buy at a convinence store instead of a soda but i had to take away one star since i think it is a bit overpriced for what it is 
positive,21/10/19,let me start out by saying that one can of switch just was not enough at least not when you are sharing it in order to properly review this i had my children join me in a little taste test of this product well the best litmus test of whether something is good or not is if your kids want more and mine both did but i was not sharing any more of this delicious drink no sir i am happy to report that the remainder of this libation was imbibed by yours truly i am not generally of big fan of the carbonated juice drinks but switch could switch my mind the kiwi strawberry taste was just right not too sweet and blended well with the carbonation for a drink that was tasty and refreshing in fact this drink would be great for a hot day or after a workout when you want something with some bite and do not really want or need another soda this is good stuff get some 
positive,8/9/20,i have to admit i liked the watermelon strawberry flavor better than this one kiwi berry but this was just as flavorful and just as pleasant just the right amount of carbonation and sweetness and i really loved the fact this has no corn syrup or refined sugar the small can size is also very handy because it is easy to slip into a bag and it is exactly one serving size as i mentioned with the other flavor this drink does not have a weird aftertaste or leave a lingering flavor on the tongue it is very clean and refreshing 
positive,22/9/21,great combination of coffee chocolate and raspberry flavors stays fresh in the bag for a long time a bit more astringent than i usually like but still very good 
positive,2/10/20,i tasted this last week and thought it was excellent the fact it has fiber is goodness that said i will be going with the peach flavor because it also packs a bit of protein 
positive,25/7/20,i was a biscuit and gravy person before i found out that i was gluten intolerant this is the best biscuit mix i have found so far 
positive,4/7/21,not much to say good stuff amazon s grocery concept is great and i look forward to ordering more now if only they offered coffee mate s vanilla chai spice creamer that is some amazingly delicious powder right there try it if you have not yet 
positive,11/9/21, the gluten free pantry chocolate truffle brownie mix ounce boxes pack of my daughter was recently diagnosed with a wheat allergy as well as some other allergies such as the hormones and antibiotics in milk and eggs so we have gone organic it has impacted our food choices but she is and we did not want her to feel as though she was different we began the search began for tasty treats that she could eat without pain we found this item and it is the most wonderful thing we could have tried for her we throw in an extra egg and a bunch of chocolate chips i have never been much of a brownie fan but these can fool even the most die hard they are fantastic she loves them as do all of us i feel like i should advertise for this company absolutely amazing 
positive,4/7/21,this brownie mix is super easy to make you only add ingredients to it and it only takes a couple minutes from mix to oven it has real chocolate chuncks in the mix which melts to make it a very yummy tasting brownie even our friends who do not eat gluten free prefer these to regular mixes i always keep a case of this in the closet 
positive,21/9/21,i have tried these and this is a very good mix i add more chocolate chips and they were very chewy and moist 
positive,11/9/21,this is a nice ground coffee and the price is very reasonable the grind is finer than what is normal for auto drip makers which is good because i can use less so it goes much further making it even more economical i have purchased it on more than one occasion and would definitely buy again 
positive,12/10/21,buy it now please these are just great with perfect flavor and texture i keep them in the refer where they are even more refreshing try them with different things in salads with crudite with good dark chocolate with your tea in the morning as we do a 
positive,11/10/21,good substitute for sugar i like it much better than stevia which to me has an awful after taste i did notice though that the erythritol is not quite as sweet as sugar which can make it just a little expensive 
positive,28/9/21,i could eat this right out of the jar i am using it to replace the natural oily peanut butter i use in my smoothies it is alot less messy and tastes delicious even my husband is surprised love it 
positive,19/10/21,love love this item i bought the regular and chocolate and enjoy them both i mix mine equal parts powder a water and it is perfect on crackers as a dipper or just off the spoon for a quick protein rich low fat snack i have also used it in protein shakes and diped raw apple and pear slices right into the powder too yum try it 
positive,4/7/21,it really does taste good i do not like to measure anything so if you put in too much water you can just add more peanut powder to make it thicker though if you do not like the creamy kind of peanut butter and only like the chunky kind this might not be for you 
positive,11/9/21,i was sceptical of this product when i received it but was sold once i gave it a try a little bit of water and you have peanut butter that your diet will like it is great in protein shakes baked items or just to eat by the spoonful reconstituted of course i have been reccommending it to everyone 
positive,12/9/21,these beans were really very good added a ham slice while cooking and came out great each time i have made the soup it is be consistently yummy 
positive,13/7/21,our family loves these chips they are light not too greasy and the seaweed taste is fantastic my wife is from japan so she turned us on to these chips 
positive,23/10/21,i have been drinking celsius now for around months prior to that i had tried several of the other energy drinks out there and always regretted it later because of all the extra calories in them when i first found celsius i figured it was too good to be true it claims to actually burn up to calories per can while i cannot comment on the calorie burning effect i do find it has a great taste the best of any energy drink out there that i have tried and does give me a boost of energy i drink one every morning overall i love this product i will purchasing this from amazon which was almost cheaper for the pack than the store i normally go to on a regular basis from now on 
positive,22/9/21,this stuff is good and i mean really good my husband drinks diet soda which contains aspartame a known neurological toxin and i wanted to provide a much safer alternative i found this at pcc and he loved it i cannot stand the taste of artificially sweetened things and i usually end up with a nasty migraine and this did not bother me one bit the taste is fantastic in my opinion but this seems to be a flavor you will either love or hate which is why i would recommend picking up a pack at the market before ordering a pack of 
negative,4/7/21,unfortunately i am highly disappointed with this product it is devoid of flavor they pride themselves on the history of the product i could have done better at my grocery store in the candy aisle i would have actually preferred a heath bar i tried it on three different days thinking possibly it was me then i had a couple friends try a couple pieces and my assessment was proved to be correct i threw away the majority of the two pound container one hour before the trash collectors arrived so the raccoons which often find their way into the garbage no matter what precautions you take would not have to suffer eating it what a waste of my hard earned money you will notice if you search google how dominant this company is believe me i nor will anyone i know ever waste a penny on this product again yes this review seems harsh but i rarely take the time to do this the only reason i have is so you do not waste your money regards to all ron
positive,11/9/21,this recipe is my favorite i bought boxes of this flavor during last years deer hunting season everyone who tried this was impressed with the flavor i did add some liquid smoke some salt and additional cayenne pepper to some of my batches i make enough deer jerky to fill up gallon bags every season and this is by far the best i have tried to date
positive,8/8/21,i received this product in record time i tried it once and ordered again in bulk and am hooked love the product and the company is excellent as far as packaging and the swift arrival time of my purchase i would recommend to all my friends 
positive,9/7/21,i drink coffee in the morning for the kick i ordered this coffee because the low acid twist intrigued me promptly forgot about that aspect until it was time to reorder which was sooner than expected because i started enjoying a second cup per day yes there is definitely something to the low acid as my stomach can tolerate two cups per day but i want that second cup due to the coffee s taste quite flavorful with good depth 
positive,24/10/21,i found this while stationed in italy and really missed them when i moved back to the states i was discussing them the other night and decided to order some from amazon they are still fantastic i eat them as a treat or as a pick me up when coffee is not available it is a shame they are not more widely available in stores the small amount of coffee filled with ground beans is a wonderful treat 
positive,4/7/21,my puppy a week bernese mountain dog has a very sensitive stomach and frequent diarrhea so she was on an expensive vet prescribed diet for the first two weeks that i had her eventually she needed a more growth oriented food so i switched her over to eukanuba large breed puppy on the recommendation of the vet but she still rarely had solid stools also each day her coat seemed less shiny she had a ton of dandruff and scratched like crazy after only a week on canidae i am gradually mixing more and more of it in and decreasing the eukanuba she is stopped itching and her poop is way more solid and far less frequent i know there is no perfect pet food but if you have a dog with a sensitive stomach and or possible allergies i am thinking corn or another filler that eukanuba and iams uses canidae could be a godsend it has been for me every dog deserves a better quality food than one with by products and a ton of fillers and some like my pup simply cannot handle that low quality stuff 
positive,11/9/21,these pouches are the next best to homemade when i do not have time to steam and blend my own baby food i always reach for happy baby 
positive,24/10/21,my cats are very picky but they love this food it is very dense and provides a large amount of good quality food for my two cats i especially like the fact that there are garden greens inside the food it is good for their digestion 
positive,22/6/21,i believe this is the same brand a lot of coffee shops use sugar free tastes great at the price i paid it is worth having a coffee shop at home 
positive,30/7/21,i have chf with cardiomyopathy i have to limit my sodium to under mg per day because of great products like this ketchup i can do that pretty easily most days my cardioelectrophysicist had never heard of no salt ketchup he thinks it is great heinz no salt ketchup tastes wonderful it has a slightly stonger tomato flavor but i would not have guessed it was no salt i use it for homemade bbq sauce french fries etc it is awesome highly recommended 
positive,10/7/21,tasty and simple everyone loves a bite so make an ugly one you can justify trying out
positive,4/7/21,this was not what i expected it is very sweet with bits of candied orange rind and garlic but i really did not notice any chili with chili in the title i expected some heat but there was none definitely needs heat 
negative,11/9/21,purchasing the glace de volaille gourmet gold roasted turkey stock from amazom i used the reccomended old world gravy recipe of sauteing onions carrots in duck fat with a cup of wine it did not inspire me the traditional basted american turkey with pan drippings for gravy cannot be substituted the aroma of a fresh turkey in the oven stirs the senses exciting the cook to prepare for a perfect gravy this cannot be duplicated in a gravy package that is designed for a gourmet market that prefers its gravy deaden in wine brown onions and thyme maybe the old world tastes are more astute but my american gravy will remain simply traditional the glace de volaille gold roasted old world gravy recipe well it went into the trash 
positive,20/9/21,i have suffered from heartburn for years and never thought that it might be due to the coffee i drink so i was very excited to give this a try i loved the taste of the coffee and my heartburn might have been a tad bit better but it was not significant i guess it is possible that my heartburn is due to something other than the coffee i drink i would still recommend this product though because it is very good coffee 
positive,13/10/21,i have been trying to find a good coffee that would not set off my ulcer and still tasted good puroast low acid coffee french roast is perfect for me it tasted rich full bodied and no harsh afterbite and it does not make my heartburn flare up you will never miss anything this coffee has to offerr except your heartburn 
positive,2/8/21,preferences for type of coffee varies from person to person so i am not surprised some people like this brand and some do not i drink coffee every day and have tried many different types i have never tried low acid coffee before so was not sure what to expect in my opinion this was very good it has a rich dark roasted starbuck like taste i recommend trying it 
positive,11/6/21,i only got to drink one cup of this to make this review but i thought it tasted great what i like about good coffee flavor is that earthy rich coffee taste that comes from quality coffee and just being fresh brewed i tested this right after the coffee maker had finished so it was as fresh as it could be i like a little honey and fresh cream in mine and i was sad i only got to have just one cup i had to share with others at home and they all liked it as well i could not tell if anything tasted different since it is supposed to be low acid it tasted like regular coffee to me 
negative,2/8/21,with both a stomach problem and a love of coffee i thought this would be a great solution i was wrong i just did not care for the taste i recommend trying some low acid coffee once somewhere you can get a small cup before purchasing a pack of bags for home brew 
positive,18/10/21,i like these potato chips they are very tasty and natural i can not find them in russia and so i will order again and again from usa 
positive,23/7/21,i remember the old shake n bake commercial from when i was a kid it is shake n bake and i helped and was curious to try it again my sample pouch had enough to coat boneless pork chops each almost a half inch thick each pouch is designed for half inch thick bone in or boneless chops it was quick and easy to coat the chops in a zip lock bag after moistening the meat with water no messy clean up and the pork chops baked up tasty and moist in just a couple minutes more than the recommended minutes i used a thermometer to check for the recommended degrees the flavor of the coating enhanced and did not dominate the flavor of the pork and it was not too salty for a quick weeknight meal i will buy this 
positive,8/7/21,i love this item the pork cooks very tender and the shake n bake adds a great flavor rather than eating plain pork a butcher recommends this to his customers a nice break from steak chicken and fish 
positive,11/6/21,i have been using shake n bake with my chicken for year but never thought to use it with pork chops until they released the original pork flavor this product is as easy to use as their other products pour the shake n bake into a sealable bag put the pork chops individual shake and then put them in the oven the package says it can be used from four to six pork chops and after using it with four i would not be surprised if i could have been able to coat four more pork chops with one package the taste is so similar to the chicken version there were some bites when i forgot i was eating pork chops and was eating chicken with shake n bake on it much like the chicken version the breading can fall off while cutting but that is really the only negative i can say about the product 
positive,25/6/21,i have only praise for this product i give it stars and not for it does not come with a bag it is called shake n bake but there is no bag to shake it in other than that this product is great it is so easy to use i used nice thick boneless pork chops and after shaking the coating fully covered all four it only needs to bake for minutes and the meat does not need to be turned over at all during the cooking i found the coating to be delicious it had a light seasoned taste that was very tasty without overpowering the taste of the pork the coating mix also kept the pork inside tender and moist without getting too crispy on the outside just crispy enough it certainly added just the right flavor to the light taste of the pork i added baked potato peas and a salad and had a very tasty meal i had not used shake n bake since i was a kid and then tended to use the chicken more i will definitely use this product on a regular basis now as well as give the chicken a go again highly recommended very easy and quick to use providing a delicious way to cook your pork 
positive,2/8/21,i have not used any shake n bake in years and when i did use it i used the version for chicken so i was curious to see how the product was after all these years i have to admit that i was pleasantly surprised it has a light flavoring tasty but does not overpower the flavor of the pork and using the coating kept the meat juicy and it was very easy to use like the name of the product says shake on the coating and bake it is easy to use and tastes good it does not get any better than that 
positive,11/6/21,we have used the pork pouch on porkt chops and believe it or not we have used it on chicken both were juicy and had a great flavor easy to use without a lot of mess you cannot go wrong with shake n bake 
positive,9/7/21,love this dip my husband is nuts over it has been eating it quite often since receiving the package all wise products have been fantastic 
positive,22/6/21,we all have our vices mine has always been chips specifically bettermade bbq chips so as i am trying to eat healthier i have tried to find a replacement for that craving i decided to give the popchips a try thinking if they were at least okay i could replace my cravings for them they are better than okay these little guys are full of flavor and crunch and not to sound like a pig but i could eat a half a bag of bettermade in one sitting but these little oz bags even though they are small they fill me up i was shocked i am not kidding i am eating healthier giving in to my craving and getting full from one small bag you cannot go wrong with these even my kids love them i am thrilled to have found a healthy alternative to fatty chips 
positive,2/8/21,these are super tasty treats for days when you want something crunchy and salty i did not find them overly salty as some commented they are very good and i would buy them again and again if the price were lower i got them as a special single serve bags for and would buy again at that price just to keep around as snacks each bag is cals and you actually feel like you are getting a real bag of potato chips yummy 
positive,11/6/21,these remind of a product called munchos that i liked a long time ago in regards to flavor great crunch and salt level i wish they packages a bit bigger than the and smaller than oz the is not quite enough and the is too much about oz would be right for my appetite 
positive,8/7/21,cannot find these in individual size packages locally so this has answered my family s needs have tried most of the varieties but we prefer the original flavor 
positive,28/9/21,they are not too salt and vinegary but still have the flavor of it very good tasting crispy 
positive,23/8/21,i have tried every variety of popchips and this one is by far my favorite the pepper gives it just the right amount of spice if you love your food to have a little kick to it then you will love these chips 
positive,1/8/21,the first time i tried this i thought wow this is great it is as satisfying as eating regular potato chips but sweeter and presumably healthier so had i written the review then i would have given it stars the reason i hesitated was that i took it with me to work and the more i tried it the more i began to question the sweetness there is no question that sweet potatoes are slightly sweet but i felt it only fair to let readers know that they might find this product to be too sweet hence the reason for the stars it is still quite good but if you find sweetness to be cloying you might not like this product for long but all in all i would still recommend it 
positive,16/7/21,this syrup is a graet value the bigger more expensive coffee shops use this same syrup to flavor their coffee drinks with additional expense to the consumer bottles are plastic instead of glass for easier shipping to consumer have these auto shipped to my home every three months 
positive,2/8/21,great portion control nice that you do not have to keep it in the fridge or freezer i am reordering some right now 
positive,11/6/21,caution do not use ice cubes in any zevia soda i am hooked on zevia sodas because their tastes are not heavy each flavored soda seems to have just the right amount of taste once you add ice the taste seems to get watered down zevia is my new soda of choice 
positive,26/6/21,this is going to sound like a broken record but this stuff is great my german shepard like the others has horrible food allergies i tried the royal canine venison which was ok but when i tried this my dog who is never that excited about food went crazy he loves the taste his stool is finally solid and his coat has become shinier yes it is expensive but worth it 
positive,20/8/21,for fans of black licorice and ouzo oghi this candy is for you very natural tasting and a nice and interesting change from the usual mint my grandmother got a pack and quickly needed me to buy more as we have not been able to find a store that carries it in town
positive,25/8/21,very fresh and tasty will buy again soon since i ordered it in dec shipping is a little later then estimate better order it earlier 
positive,19/10/21,these are really tasty and make a great high protein snack i order them regularly and keep them in my desk drawer they are really filling and taste great 
negative,2/8/21,i have eaten a few of these and while they tasted interesting at first i cannot bite into one now without gagging i am not a vegetarian but i was looking for some high protein snacks so i picked these up a vegetarian friend of mine tried one and instantly hated them calling the taste disgusting and the texture too much like meat the taste is not something that grows on you and i can not recommend these to anyone especially at this price 
positive,11/6/21,i was happy to see that i could purchase this on amazon previously had to go to our local health food store price is about the same more convenient to come to the house high protein low fat tasty and give a energy boost on intense bike rides or anytime snack when you do not want a carb rush 
positive,22/10/21,we were pleasantly surprised at how good these tasted the dv for sodium is so while not excessive we limit ourselves to one at a time 
positive,6/8/21,i purchased this for some family members that only like instant coffee they have really enjoyed this and i tried it and found out it has a great taste i would recommend this to anyone that wants a great cup of coffee without having to make a full pot when they only want a cup 
positive,24/6/21,nescafe taster s choice instant coffee is as good if not better than the local coffee shops plus nescafe taster s choise cost less than cents per cup ron jones from texas
positive,17/4/21,i have tried many of the various coffee sticks out there but these are the best tasting not that strong but not like water either perfect for me to me it tastes like the coffee you get at the tgif restaurants so that is why i like it easy and tasty just how i like my women 
positive,10/3/21,this jam is amazing great flavor great texture and spreads well on anything might i suggest to put it in some vanilla ice cream for your very own huckleberry ice cream definitely recommend this product now only if i bought more 
positive,17/4/21,this cereal product is delicious and is a nice change from so many gluten free cereals that have a cinnamon flavor i really liked the fact that it is a high protein cereal which helps to control blood sugar levels 
positive,21/1/21,i gave this product a try since being a gluten and dairy free person limits snacks this tastes really good and its hard just to have a few i will continue to purchase this product 
positive,30/1/21,you can add ground turkey to this and it tastes wonderful i was not a big ground turkey fan until i tried it with this mix if you do not have ground turkey you can boil a chicken breast with skin in the cups of water then discard the bone and skin and add the mix i have made it both ways and they are both good i also tried it with ground beef but like it with turkey the best 
positive,13/2/21,i do not know what possessed me to try this but am sure glad i did i made it per directions just adding water and a can of tomato paste i would not change a thing i did not tell my so there was no meat in it and thought it was awesome could not believe the very low calories and high fiber a definite keeper and will be a staple in my pantry 
positive,15/1/21,my dog loves this food and it has really cut back on the tear staining issues the staining was a big problem and i did quite a bit of research to find a solution i considered a few products that you add to the dog food or come in pill form and several of these apparently work however many of them are actually antibiotics i am not sure it is a good idea to use very often my research led me to antioxidants like blueberries and avoiding wheat to cut back on the tear stains and give him a healthier coat this food is not only grain free but is also loaded with blueberries yes the first ingredient is potato however in firstmate s defense most companies include several non protein ingredients so that they can put them lower down on the list thus making it look like there is more protein than anything else also meat meal is a much more concentrated protein than regular meat somewhere in the range of more concentrated 
positive,6/3/21,this was their first product it is filtered hence the clear color and while does not have the same nutrients as their unfiltered product for taste it cannot be beat i would recommend to those trying to get off soft drinks and something marginally better 
positive,8/6/21,this tea is amazing i cannot believe the price the price i paid is less than half of what other companies charge and this tea is delicious i love it fast delivery too great job 
positive,7/1/21,this is a quality rock candy product and a very large amount for the price i would deffinately buy this product again if needed purchased as a gift and the person was more than thrilled
positive,17/4/21,every year for the holidays i buy my brother a pack of these chai tea packets for him to use at university he loves them 
positive,10/3/21,can you really ever go wrong with the most trusted name in oatmeal in fact can you ever really go wrong with oatmeal it is pretty hard to screw up oatmeal the only factor at play here is if you like the flavor i really enjoy oatmeal but i hate the effort that it can take compared to getting a bowl of cereal these instant packs take virtually no time and you do not have to mess with extra ingredients like brown sugar and maple extract etc they come in many different flavors and if you like oatmeal and you like brown sugar this is a quick and easy way to satisfy your morning hunger 
positive,14/1/21,the taste is great the shipment came in fast i love it and so does my entire family the beans are on the smaller side but it does not matter to us 
positive,24/5/21,we have a standing order for the beef sticks but always run out before hand and must order sooner love them 
positive,14/10/21,my husband complained that split peas did not have any taste anymore he really likes these and said they taste like split peas used to taste seem to be very good quality 
positive,7/2/21,this is great convenience to have on my counter next to my keurig and kcups i really think this is a great value too 
positive,29/3/21,this tea has lots of flavors i first started loving chai tea about years ago i have tried many of the boxed liquid teas and i do like them i have preferred the brand einstein bagles uses but since i have a starbucks close by have grown to like the one they use as well my favorite is the masala tea made my a local indian restaurant this most closely approximates that i am still trying to replicate it but for now this is the best i can do i really like this tea as a bonus if i forget to empty the basket when i leave work when i get in the next day the whole area smells great 
positive,17/4/21,it is tasty although they say a medley of oranges mingled with piquant leaves i also enjoy it because it is caffeine free good for chilly nights 
positive,10/3/21,this is a great tasting tea the taste is not too strong or overpowering and not too weak i will be purchasing more 
positive,10/7/21,i love a good strong cup of morning coffee and this one comes as close to perfect as one can i usually set my machine to make a mug of coffee the first cup i had of this brew tasted just a little stronger that my usual one i then dropped the cup size down one notch made a second cup and found what i was looking for tried my usual coffees with the smaller cup they did not compare to the rich aroma fine taste that i am now getting with revv
positive,27/1/21,anyone shopping for chives in the grocery store knows how expensive chives are i am almost surprised restaurants do not charge extra for them these chives are a steal compared to the grocery and taste as good as mccormick s at probably a of the price also the shipping was very fast i would buy again without a doubt 
positive,1/6/21,great tasting pecans though it would be great if they were larger packing would have been better in boxes instead cos quite a few were turned to pecan dust i would buy again though since they are really good to eat as a snack or cereal topping 
positive,20/8/21,this gluten free bar is much better than most a rich combination of just what it says fruit and nuts however the unit description is incorrect it is not boxes but one box of eight bars 
positive,14/8/21,this fruit and nut bar by kind is very very tasty travels well even in the heat no problem with melting or not being able to handle due to the heat nuts do require chewing so would not recommend them to anyone with chewing issues otherwise they are superb 
positive,21/4/21,this is a great cereal i could not find it for over a year i was on amazon and just happen to search for the item and they had it i am so happy i can still buy this product 
positive,1/4/21,if you like popcorn you have to try this we have an counter top popcorn machine and it work s great try it you will love it 
positive,17/4/21,this popcorn rivals that of movie theaters even the so call people selling movie theater popcorn cannot hold a candle to this popcorn 
positive,10/3/21,we have been using this product for over a year now and that should speak volumes because we are a popcorn loving bunch the convenience of having everything measured and ready to go at a minute s notice is great i have a popcorn machine in the media room and so we love to munch popcorn while watching movies we feel we are at a theater eating the real deal i will continue to purchase even though it is not the most figure friendly popcorn taste outweighs the waist tee he 
positive,22/4/21,i would say this is the best tasting popcorn have eaten it to me is better than movie thearte popcorn it has the right mixed of salt and oil to give it a really good flavor
positive,25/4/21,i have a waring pro and this stuff is fantastic it is salty and buttery and tastes like movie theater popcorn some complain it does not all pop that is because some of the kernals are thrown out of the kettle while the others pop it always fills the tray that comes with my popper all the way up i love it 
positive,1/4/21,we use these popcorn packs for our party rental business we can keep enough in stock they are easy for our customers to use and taste great 
positive,30/6/21,great taste and easy to use i did find that if you let the package soak in hot water for a few minutes before use it makes the oil come out of the package easier 
positive,1/3/21,this popcorn tastes great its so easy just cut off the top and pour in the contents i will for sure be buying more of this popcorn 
positive,29/1/21,this popcorn tastes great the only complaint i have is that it is way too salty and we like salty all we do is pour out a tiny bit of salt before adding it to the kettle and it is perfect 
positive,17/4/21,i use this with a whirly pop and it is a great combination as others have said tastes and smells just like theater popcorn due to the use of coconut oil very few un popped kernels and total cooking time is just about minutes on medium heat i just dump the whole packet into the popper and start cranking i do not think it matters if you dump only the oil first even though it is pretty thick but once heated it thins out i will not use microwave popcorn anymore the taste cannot be compared to this no matter what brand you buy we have a large family and have tried all sorts of brands of microwave popcorn and none come close in taste to this i would estimate that one pack makes just short of microwave popcorn bags update ok here is the scoops on this product i have tried to duplicate the taste by buying coconut oil popcorn and flavacol salt flavoring cooked it exactly the same the taste is close but nope not as good as this product from great northern of course the final price is cheaper if you mix it yourself but the end taste is not as good i have tried the act ii buttery flavor popping oil instead of the coconut oil and still the taste is not the same as this i often use whirl butter topping on my popcorn which tastes fantastic but these bags from great northern do not need a thing as far as topping trust me you will not go back to microwave popcorn again while cooking you will swear you are in the movie theater 
positive,10/3/21,got a popcorn machine as a gift for a basement family room have tried a few different popcorn oil products and been disappointed with the taste probably a little pricier to buy everything prepackaged this way but the best flavor we have found very happy with our purchase will definitely buy again 
positive,30/5/21,bigelow vanilla caramel tea is the most delicious tea i have ever tasted i use silk soy creamer with the tea to add an extra vanilla taste i make my cup pot of tea every morning using bags of the bigelow caramel tea with bags of bigelow decaffeinated english tea i like my tea slightly decaffeinated i wish you made a decaffeinated caramel vanilla tea because the taste would probably be mind blowing 
positive,28/9/21,chewy tasty just the right amount of brazil nuts and love using the little hammer to break apart the toffee
positive,6/5/21,this tea is really quite good it is a quality black tea with a subtle cinnamon flavoring definitely one of my favorites as with many food items sold on amazon i would recommend trying a single box from your local retailer if you can find it before committing to a whole six pack once you know you like it however the value of this offering really cannot be beat anywhere 
positive,20/4/21,this is hands down the best gluten free bread mix on the market if you are on a gluten free diet and make your own bread you have to try this 
positive,20/4/21,i really enjoyed this product it is very easy to mix and bake the taste and texture are very close to that of a wheat flour based bread 
positive,21/4/21,i like these bars but would rank them second to the think thin peanut butter variety those are great these are very good both offer up a good amount of protein for people who need more in their diet such as vegetarians 
positive,2/5/21,what i enjoy most with this variety pack is the varieties i do not get bored with just flavour and there are some flavors i cannot find locally 
positive,18/12/19,outstanding product the greattea gives me a warm comfotable feeling and makes my senses come alive the bags are quite large that is a good thing because i get a bigger cup of tea with full flavor just fantastic 
positive,19/1/20,first time we have used chebe produce we loved it has great taste and easy to make will buy again 
positive,19/1/20,awesomely tasty cereal cocoa beach is my favorite all time and also by kashi kid cereal for adults schweet
positive,31/3/20,i loved this cereal so did all the family we just cannot have it any more due to dietary restrictions too much sugar would love to have in the house again 
positive,18/12/19,this is a great bbq sauce that even our kids really like a little kick but not spicy great alternative for those looking for a low carb product without chemical sweeteners 
positive,13/10/19,this is genius i purchase angel hair first and after that bought a big box of angel hair and fettuccine the product is amazing do not get fooled by all these negative reviews if you like asian food you probably already know that their pasta does not taste like american european kind it has a different texture and taste so these noodles taste exactly like the ones you order at big bowl the comments about the smell are ridiculous how many raw uncooked food smells good are you kidding me for instance i love steamed broccoli but it smells bad while steaming please follow the instructions rinse in cold water for at least seconds and boil for one minute dry in paper towels if you do not follow instructions you will ruin any food even your most favorite since the pasta is calories i finally could indulge myself with a really good pasta sauce no low fat anymore or some seafood alfredo the possibilities are endless please note that the noodles even better the next day since they easily absorb all flavors absolutely delicious and guilt free 
positive,28/9/20,people who complain about smell need to read and educate themselves yes when you open it smells that is how they are packed all you have to do is rinse yes read instructions then i throw in a skillet for a bit usually with garlic and seasoning because i did find hard to pat dry if you throw in a skillet for a few it takes the step where you pat dry away there is no smell just eat however you want just don t write negative comments if you don t read the site or directions the site alone will answer any questions quickly m
positive,16/11/20,i was having trouble locating apple chips locally and was happy to find these at a good price amazon i love the chicken salad a chain restaurant sells that have apple chips on top and wanted to try to replicate the recipe at home these work well and taste great the only issue i have is that they really are not the healthy option i thought they contain oil and sugar bringing the calorie content to per bag it is better to eat an apple but these are a mighty tasty snack 
positive,27/2/20,i love these biscottis they are calories each and taste wonderful because there are so few calories these falls under a diet product which means they are not cheap however i got them here for about less than the other vendor i used online 
positive,26/2/21,justin s individual nut butter packs are delicious and perfect for back packing trips i bring them every time without dissatisfaction highly recommended product 
positive,18/12/19,i have tried so many different jasmine teas and this one is my favorite there are some i just do not like this brand has a wonderful flavor i have been drinking this for about years now it is a good deal if you buy this from amazon on auto ship you cannot beat the price 
positive,19/1/20,this tea is very refreshing and i love the mint flavor i use it for ice tea i especially like this brand of tea 
positive,13/9/20,i love these bars this is a smaller company producing an extremely high quality product you get what you pay for i am glad to pay for such a great product and will continue to purchase these thank you for such an outstanding product 
positive,10/7/20,these tomatoes seem very soft for dried tomatoes which is great they are also very flavorful i have been using them in a coconut curry and i do not even bother soaking them to soften them i just throw of them five halves in the vita mix with everything but the coconut milk blend for a minute and then simmer together with the coconut milk delicious i originally purchased these because i had some raw food recipes that called for quite a bit of dried tomatoes and these seem nearly perfect for that the thing that makes them less than perfect to me is that they are not organic but pounds is still so much i gave one bag to my boyfriend who thinks i am weird for giving him a pound of dried tomatoes but once i give him the coconut curry recipe he will be thanking me oh and the bags zip lock shut after they are opened which is a nice touch 
positive,14/4/21,i cannot say if it gives sustained energy as i just had my first pack i will say they were crisp and tasted great i am always looking for portable energy food that is not low calorie these are about calories per pack and since i take snacks like this hiking backpacking that is a good thing so far i really like them perhaps i will update after i take them hiking and see how they hold up 
positive,24/4/21,if you love chocolate and fruits this is the product for you i have just finished my first bag and i still cannot get over the taste the candies are bite size and even though i hate using cliches you simply cannot get enough of them the chocolate does not taste bitter but it is not too sweet either and the pomegranate enhances the flavor with a slightly sour touch overall just like those commercials say your mouth will thank you 
positive,28/4/21,bought these at costco for a few cents less and figure they will either double in price or never be in stock again glad to know they are here on amazon they are addictingly good the deep dark chocolate flavor is haunting i was looking for choc cherries but these will do nicely
positive,12/7/21,i bought this chocolate for my parents as a gift they loved it it has a little sour taste and good quality of chocolate 
positive,18/12/19,this makes a good quick and sustaining meal with flatbread or rice we have found that adding liquid such as milk converts it to a very tasty soup i could undoubtedly make something better with fresh ingredients but that is not always feasible and for convenience and reliability the koi line is hard to beat 
positive,19/1/20,i found this product at a little tiny store i bought it figuring what the heck my hair is damaged and a little bit fried this product gave me shine it calmed most of my frizzies and a wonderful subtle scent to go with it i love this product the only down side is its a little bit hard to find 
positive,28/4/21,this is pretty good tea i use it to make iced tea i will usually use two of these tea bags with a few of the cheap plain tea bags in order to make mango tea that does not taste like mango juice good stuff at a great price 
positive,8/8/20,received my order of honey pepper jerky a couple days ago the jerky is sweet and the pepper is very good without being overwhelming i generally prefer jerky that is very dry and chewy but i really enjoyed the taste and texture of this product i would not hesitate to order again or recommend to others 
positive,22/5/21,this is a very nice hot cereal the five grains give it a somewhat nutty flavor and a more complex texture than regular oatmeal and it is quick to cook on the stove at only about minutes i like adding wyman s frozen blueberries and strawberries i add those when the oatmeal is done cooking but the heat is still on so the frozen fruit can thaw a bit as well as a bit of maple syrup and milk mmm mm mm 
positive,18/12/19,is this the healthiest breakfast no of course not but does it taste great yes i have a minute commute and drinking my chocolate protein shake makes the drive much more enjoyable and cuts down on my getting ready time in the morning at home i have one for breakfast every day and my husband has one for lunch every day we love them i prefer the chocolate and my husband drinks the vanilla and strawberry neither of us love the dark chocolate definitely try these 
positive,19/1/20,this is a tasty treat with a thin layer of sugary jelly in the middle no oozing jelly or anything as i have initially thought for pcs i think this item is too expensive and would not buy again 
positive,3/8/20,i am quite fond of these bars they are not full of nasty ingredients like most commercial cereal bars the only downside is that they do not fill me up at all they are good as a snack but i cannot eat these for breakfast without being hungry soon afterwards 
positive,29/7/21,great way to keep fruit in your diet if you follow weight watcher this is a good snack for you three point and you get more fruit in your diet 
positive,8/7/20,we use this as a base for sauces and in soups and other meals its very flavorful and delicious its even a good price with subscribe and save would buy again 
positive,13/4/21,this sauce is awesome i went on a month long quest for the next best table hot sauce i read a million reviews from different hot sauce sites only to order product after product and finding it flavorless under powered over powered or simply disgusting this is the most versatile hot sauce out there it makes a fantastic table sauce as well as an excellent marinade for some wings it showcases the cayenne and garlic without making the cayenne or garlic so much that it is unwelcome it is an immediate medium burn and should satisfy anyone seeking a nice well rounded table sauce by the way these independent hot sauce reviews non amazon were hard to go through a lot of them are video reviews why do people reviewing hot sauce think we want to see them eating hot sauce on a cracker over a crappy webcam and then they review the sauce while continuing to munch on a mouthful of hot cracker gross 
positive,20/2/21,i discovered ambrosia custard while in ireland and absolutely love the subtle taste and smooth texture ambrosia is a great light dessert when looking for something with minimal sugar and the taste better than birds i am going to i would like to be able to purchase it in the aseptic boxes sold in the uk but am happy it is available at amazon 
positive,9/12/20,i add this to sugarfree cappuchino and it tastes great it tastes just like the brands in the gas stations when i get a cappuccino there 
positive,1/4/21,i ordered this jerky because it was the best price per pound and i had never had brown sugar jerky it was surprisingly good the jerky was not too dry and did not have an overly sweet taste i would recommend this as an option on road trips or as a snack that increases your daily protein intake i have even added this to amazon s program that automatically sends it to you each month i definitely got my money s worth 
positive,25/2/21,i used these as a healthier option than chocolate for some cake pops the yogurt is strong and tasty i would buy again 
positive,18/12/19,i got these from the grocery store when i could not have milk because of the baby i had to have some chocolate this is some really tasty chocolate i mean real good i can have milk now but i still buy these love them 
negative,19/1/20,searching for a replacement for ghirardelli s excellent but discontinued expresso escape bars i tried these unfortunately i ordered of them i tried parts of of these and could not detect any hints of chocolate or coffee in any of them i kept trying them because i could not believe what i was not tasting ended up throwing the rest away 
positive,14/10/20,this cereal has no artificial sweetners is high in fiber but has a great taste a hard combination to find 
positive,10/3/21,i am becoming one of goya s biggest fans i had seen these on the shelves and they were really inexpensive but i opted for a test can of vienna sausages instead they were so good i went back the next day to get this tin of sardines they have a great sardine flavor not fishy or oily at all and the tomato sauce is thick and rich i am of the opinion that sardines make everything taste better and these go great just on a regular saltine great for snacks or a pack lunch or road trips i will probably edit this review sometime in the next month to give this product stars because i see addiction ahead lol
positive,15/8/21,this has been my staple breakfast cereal for a couple of years now i love the taste 
positive,27/4/21,very delicious cookies both sweet and crunchy i got these for christmas gifts to go along with tea i think the receivers will really enjoy these 
positive,24/1/21,i have purchased the lemon raspberry and shortbread cookies and liked them all what i like the most about the brand of cookies is that they are not too sweet perfect for my taste 
positive,14/7/20,new look but same taste a wonderfull cup of tea whit black cherry berry flavor it is a must to have 
positive,5/6/21,this does not taste at all like cough syrup as the other reviewer stated this is the best gum out there and i highly recommend it i am not a plant i live in austin tx and bought a pack of this in san antonio i just ordered a box on amazon this and the lemon are the best flavors orbit makes john
positive,9/7/21,my cat loves it my neighbour s cat loves it just be aware that feeding fish product exclusively is unhealthy for your cat i think aside from this pack you should also get the chicken etc pack for a balanced diet 
positive,5/6/21, great taste great taste dissolves well etc highly recommend i can sometimes buy at kroger i usually add to more wter than recommended thanks hansen 
positive,25/7/21,i use this powder to make the jamba juice equivalent of the matcha green tea blast it does a great job in reproducing the taste i would recommend this supplier 
positive,13/7/21,best tasting agave so far and i have tried many of the popular store carried brands 
positive,9/7/21,i never realized this but the salt and mineral concentration of seawater is different in each part of the world and therefore the taste of sea salt varies based on where it comes from to me french gray sea salt is delicious the flavor is more gentile than regular salt and has a slightly tangy taste with just a hint of minerals the price may seem high compared to table salt but amazon s price is low compared to other places i have bought it definitely worth it in my opinion one thing to note is that this sea salt is very moist so it does not work well in a grinder or shaker sometimes i will serve it in a salt cellar but generally i just keep it in a glass jar by the stove for cooking and use regular salt at the table 
positive,8/7/21,this is a fantastic product my bull terrier was capable of spitting out a pill no matter what it was inserted into peanut butter steak chicken hot dogs you name it i have tried it now he patiently waits while i get his pill ready and gulps it down absolutely amazing i will never be without this product 
positive,15/7/21,i read the bad reviews on this coffee and am glad that i did not let them dissuade me from buying this product i like the natural fusions vanilla coffee by starbucks and this one is just as good it is a pleasing coffee with subtle caramel undertones i will buy it again in the future if it is available 
positive,6/7/21,my name is patrick and i am an american shorthair of indeterminate age and semi discriminating tastes my human asked me to write this review for the instinct raw boost bites chicken formula she got through the vine program because she is unable to sample them herself i gobbled up the portion my human gave me right away as far as i am concerned these deserve two paws up my housemate tiger also enjoyed the bites she has a more discriminating palate than me but she liked these just fine we think they compare favorably to other feline brand snacks like pounce and temptations each piece is larger than say a pounce pellet which our human broke into smaller pieces so one or two make a more than adequate snack according to my human the package says that the treats are grain free and are made from minimally processed freeze dried raw ingredients ingredients include chicken turkey vegetables like butternut squash and broccoli ground flaxseed salmon oil and mixed tocopherols with citric acid i am not entirely sure what all that stuff means but i would recommend the bites to other cats who enjoy chicken flavored snacks that are meant for cats 
positive,13/8/21,much more buttery taste than all other light butter popcorns by far the best light popcorn i have tasted 
positive,5/6/21,some of the best coffee i have ever had smooth and full of flavor it does get a little bitter if you weaken it too much but any coffee will 
positive,9/7/21,i need a filler and this was on sale at the moment for for it is worth it add water chicken potatoes carrots and mumble jumpbo result is good and tastety individual package serve about meals and it can not be save for long after opening so plan carefully 
positive,17/6/21,love this stuff i bought it because it was cheap but it tastes great it actually comes from india and the ingredients on the package are all things i can pronounce and recognize i have been eating indian food for a long time and this was my first successful attempt to make it at home love it 
positive,31/8/21,simply put these packets are easy to use and yield a good result when you want indian in a pinch i modified the recipe on the packet by adding chopped onion and some leftover roasted potatoes making the result more of a complete meal the salt content is a little high but overall the quality is excellent for a concentrate 
positive,7/8/21,i received my two boxes of coffee quickly in and in perfect condition this is the best deal i have found for this and will be purchasing coffee this way in the future 
positive,6/9/21,i have been drinkin this coffee for about three months and in my opinion it is the best coffee i have ever tasted i used to wake up with headaches almost every morning and now the aches are gone i have lost weight about pounds pounds and what i really like about this coffee is that if i do not drink it for a couple of days i will not get those i need cafeine headaches in the morning 
positive,5/6/21,i gave half of the pack to my friend visiting from tokyo we both love them although it would be nice if they came in bigger cans 
positive,9/7/21,these almonds are so yummy i ordered them online because both of my stores were always out walmart and target is where i get them i go through these very quickly i like spicy foods so to me they are not hot but just right 
positive,19/6/21,love the taste not to hot but a little tangy price is good and really good service 
positive,5/9/21,these almonds just have a great flavor just the right amount of heat it is hard to stop eating them good thing my wife is here to stop me 
positive,10/10/21,i love the strength and taste of pg tips i grew up in england drinking this tea and when i came to america in i just could not drink the weak tasteless tea that was being sold on the supermarket shelves i have introduced my wife and friends to this tea they now cannot drink anything else 
positive,29/9/21,i like this flavor a lot when i make this i add about cup of regular old fashioned oats it makes it not quite so sweet and i like the texture of the non instant oats i just add water and cook in microwave for minutes i have no idea what someone said meant about the fake flavoring smell lingering for a week i did not have any problem with the smell 
positive,11/9/21,i am very happy with this product it tastes really yummy and does not have lots of extra ingredients i love the variety in the ella products and that my baby is getting lots of healthy foods in one meal also it is very easy to just squeeze it onto a spoon to feed no mess 
positive,5/6/21,this is an great green tea choice if you like a blend of different teas i thought it was well balanced and tasted great overall 
positive,9/7/21,i have tried other root beer popsicles before but they were not as close to being as good as a w s it was very easy i just put them in the freezer and then after dinner my family eats them 
positive,26/8/21,this cheese had a great smoked flavor not over powering as some can be it worked very well with must of my grilled recipes 
negative,26/7/21,i was quite excited to try these cocoa roasted almonds out i love almonds and i love chocolate and most reviews of this product imply that you get your fix of both without the extra sugar well there is definitely a whole lot less sugar in this thing it tastes pretty bad to me and i was quite shocked i guess i need at least a little more sweet but i am shocked because i am not that much of a sweet tooth it is the bitter after taste that really bothers me with this product i really could not take it so just fair warning to those who might think this is going to be a great combo of chocolate and almond think again this is really just cocoa and almond and for me that left a very bad taste 
positive,11/9/21,these almonds make a good snack the cocoa coating is not sweet in fact it is vaguely bitter and it is not overpowering the nuts themselves were good and fresh my wife and i both liked them on the other hand my daughter said i do not hate them but i do not love them either save these for the adults they would work well with red wine or sweet cocktails 
positive,11/9/21,i like these like the packaging too these are not chocolate dipped but cocoa powdered and the flavor is cocoa not chocolate very sweet probably good because a few go along way very flavorful 
positive,15/9/21,these are exactly what they say they are cocoa roasted almonds people expecting an overly sweet chocolate covered almond are going to be disappointed they do contain artificial sweeteners which seem to be one of the biggest complaints but i would also counter that with the argument that normal chocolate covered almonds have it too overall they are sweet but not overtly so a good snack for people looking for a slightly less sugar loaded version of a sweet almond 
positive,5/6/21,love this sauce taste is perfect i use this sauce with so many food but mostly with macaroni cheese so go for it best sauce 
positive,9/7/21,love the taste of this sauce we have been using this for over a year great price good quality using this makes the pasta very yummy a great buy 
positive,14/9/21,i purchase several types of snacks for my hubby and i but find this product to be one of our favorites it has lots of sesame sticks which we love also the idea that four packages are included in the price is a good buy i would definitely buy again 
positive,29/9/21,my husband loves these granola bars he uses them to satisfy his sweet tooth and his chocolate cravings and i do not mind because they are a lot better than eating a candy bar the price is a decent savings from what i have seen in stores but i have not been able to find this particular kind locally anymore so i will continue to buy from here 
positive,10/7/21,highly recommend this flavor pack absolutely love each of them my and year olds love them so glad i went with these vs the other brand 
positive,1/3/20,love the hawaiian shaved ice flavors and so do my kids they have a rich not watered down taste that you cannot beat 
positive,28/7/20,this is by far the best product on the market i have purchased this item several times and have never been disappointed one time my lab got to the package before me and he enjoyed it as well but seemed to prefer the cherry the most hawaiian shaved ice syrup is awsome its number one at my house for the kids and sometimes my dog 
positive,28/7/20,we had a yard sale and sold snow cones with hawaiian shaved ice snow cone syrups it was a huge hit i especially liked the choice of flavors i will definetly be ordering more as we will be having several more yard sales before the season is over 
positive,10/11/19,we decided to try our hand at snow cone making this summer since the money we spent last year at our local stand could have bought a small house this was our first purchase of syrup and we are so pleased with the quality it tastes exactly the same as what we have enjoyed in the past the banana is delish and my kids have loved every flavor we have tried thus far wonderful product 
positive,1/3/20,as a hot drink this made a great alternative to tea it is spicy and somehow refreshing it tastes mostly natural and it is said to be but i did not have retail packaging nor are the ingredients listed online so i have no idea what is actually in the product and i would want to know for sure before buying very much of it i also would like to try it in carbonated water to see if one can make a more naural less sugary ginger ale 
positive,3/8/19,this ginger lemon drink is a foil packet of instant powder that only needs a cup of boiling water to make a hot tasty very flavorful drink with the honey already included it is excellent if you feel a scratchy throat or sniffle coming on i think you will like it as much as i did 
positive,6/2/21,i love ginger especially the crystalized ginger candy and this beverage tasted just like those candies to me i tried it hot and cold i love it both ways but maybe the cold a bit more how nice it would be to take some of these packets on any type of trip that would get me sick from motion sickness it tastes so good that i would drink it just because but to know it is good for my digestion makes it all the better if you like the taste of ginger you will love this drink tastes so natural and good 
negative,24/2/21,i only had one packet to test of this product and i put it into a glass of hot water it is mostly ginger flavored with just a hint of lemon the ginger is so strong that it actually tastes a bit like sweetened pepper and it leaves a kind of nasty taste in your mouth after it goes down perhaps it might be better if you only added a bit of the packet to tea or only used a bit of the packet in the water because the ginger is very overwhelming i was hoping for more lemon flavoring to balence out the ginger this probably is good to settle the stomach if you can stomach the flavor so this will not be a product that i would use again 
positive,13/5/21,i received this product as part of the amazon vine program excellent taste and wonderful to take with you i get just order some hot water at any restaurant and bring my own pack 
positive,1/3/20,milo was my daily equivalent of coffee back in singapore but now that i moved to the us i was shocked to find that the grocery stores near where i live does not sell this drink so i was glad to find it on amazon and it tastes as great reminds me of home too i hope it gets restocked soon though 
positive,28/7/20,i liked this a lot and will keep this in my tea stock the bergamot is strong and compliments the full bodied earl grey tea well 
positive,13/5/20,very pleased with the smooth not too weak slightly bolder taste of this yuban dark roast right where i like the taste of my coffee at a price point that i can enjoy as well low acidity too perfect 
positive,26/3/21,very tasty our family loves this soda i especially like that it is all natural no hfcs it is very light and fruity and not too sweet it has a very pleasant light pink color 
positive,29/8/19,i love coconut and i love cashews if i could eat only those to things for the rest of my life i would die happy this is a great bar if you enjoy coconut flavor cashew flavor 
positive,7/2/21,well i am just going to go on faith that the carbs carbs i do not have a lab at my house and it tastes great 
positive,14/10/21,so far i like this cherry juice best i was expecting it to be thinner and watered down compared to the concentrate i had been mixing tart is smart concentrate cup per qt of water which i believe is what they suggest but this tastes much better and stronger perhaps tastes better because it tastes stronger to me the tart cherry juice works better than glucosamine for me my knees creak far less and i am much more limber when i wake up i cannot say anything about sleeping better as i slept fine before i started drinking cherry juice 
positive,7/8/20,it works and the taste is very pleasing i will order again to get through those occasional sleepy afternoons works faster than a cup of coffee 
positive,1/3/20,my months old enjoys all earth s best products so i decided to get this one too he really likes it although i think his favorite is apples and apricots like all the other products i bought from this brand i was not disappointed 
positive,28/7/20,the best coconut water it is much better in the bottle than the paper box i would recommend it it even tastes great at room temperature 
positive,14/9/21,the taste is really good i do love coconut but this has just enough balance where the coconut does not overpower it helps with my heartburn as well 
negative,17/12/20,it does not taste like pure coconut water its taste like some drink with coconut flavour i would not prefer these bottles instead i would go for zico smaller packs they taste better than these bottled drink 
positive,2/5/20,so healthy and good for you and it tastes great i know that is a personal view but this is my favorite of all the coconut waters i have tried no added sugar and so not too sweet the pack of six x cartons are great value too 
positive,14/7/21,i took a few sips of this stuff and could not help but wonder what all the reviews were for to me the taste kind of reminds me of those chocolatey breakfast shakes however by the end of the bottle my opinion was completely changed it has a very good sweet chocolate taste even better this stuff is killer for hangovers i was walking around with a headache and general malaise all day picked up one of these drank it and within an hour or two my headache and general unease was completely gone i am sold on this product 
positive,18/7/19,zico probably has the best taste of the coconut water brands i have tried this passion fruit flavor is great refreshing not too sweet i am not a fan of the unflavored kinds i have tried zico s mango but prefer the passion fruit over it 
positive,1/3/20,very tasty and filling if you are watching your diet it has a lot of flavor and satisfies that craving for chocolate 
negative,28/7/20,i was excited to find zico on auto delivery but really disappointed in the new packaging and recipe i ordered boxes and they had a plastic after taste i thought maybe it was just this batch so i waited for my next order same thing taste like plastic and made from concentrate it use to be so good cancelled my subscription today 
positive,13/6/20,not sure where all the bad reviews are comming from i bought two cases to take camping with me the first bottle tasted just as good as the last 
positive,10/3/20,came quickly tastes good and pops well i like the separate flavor package for easier use i am ordering a second case 
negative,9/5/20,consistency is ok but product is absolutely tasteless might be possible to add to other cereals but not much fun to eat by itself
positive,14/5/19,these banana nut bars are soft and chewy with a nice banana bread flavor they go great with a cup of coffee for a quick light breakfast or an afternoon snack 
positive,19/10/20,i received a sample from influenster and i have to say these are my new favorite breakfast bar i love banana nut bread and these have that same flavor great for on the go and they are healthy for you too i keep one in my purse in case i ever need a quick snack definitely recommend these 
positive,1/3/20,i recently tried the quaker banana nut bread cereal bar and was pleasantly surprised from first bite i felt like i was really eating banana nut bread and it was simply delicious 
positive,28/7/20,quaker soft baked cereal bar banana nut bread are great tasting and perfect for on the go they are a great healthy snack and a better alternate instead of s candy bar or something high in sugars this a perfect snack for the whole family 
positive,7/3/20,these quaker banana bread bars are so tasty and i just love that they are low calorie giving me a guilt free snack 
positive,4/8/20,i was a little wary trying these because i do not like dense chewy bars that hurt your jaw to eat and that is what i really thought this was going to be i could not have been more wrong i bit into it and got a crunch from the almonds on top and i had to check the ingredients soy crisps inside i received one bar as a sample and went out and bought an entire box that same week however even though on the package it says that it tastes great heated up i did not like it heated up it lost the crunch and seemed to become that dreaded chewy bar i still give this product stars though because heating it up is definitely not something that you have to do 
positive,26/12/19,this bar is sooooo good it said to heat it up to taste better but i just ate it out of the pack it was very filling for me it does taste just like a banana nut muffin this bar was moist and soft my husband loved the bar as well i would take this bar on the go or just have as a snack it was filling with a cup of coffee i will be purchasing more yummy 
positive,28/3/21,i tried the banana nut bread soft baked cereal bar and it was so good if you like banana flavored anything you will love this this is perfect for breakfast on the go for people like me who end up eating on their commute or for an afternoon snack it is sweet enough to satisfy a sweet tooth it reminds me of a healthier version of toaster strudel the best part is that is contains protein b vitamins and fiber i cannot wait to try the cinnamon pecan 
positive,6/2/20,i bought these as a way to supplement my meals as well as get more fiber and protein first of all these bars are fairly nutritious they are made of natural ingredients and whole grains just like the cereal each bar contains of fiber and of protein considering most people in the united states do not get enough fiber that is a very decent amount previously i was eating the fiber one bars oats chocolate count boxes pack of while you get more fiber in those bars you only get of protein the kashi bars are made of better and more nutritious ingredients and they taste better as well each bar has only calories but they are very filling due to the fiber and protein although a bar made of brown rice and oats does not sound very tasty these are some of the best bars i have tried as the name implies they are not chewy but not too crunchy either below is the main nutritional info calories total fat sat fat sodium carbs fiber protein 
positive,25/4/21,after doing some of research both taste testing and strictly from a nutritional standpoint these kashi golean bars in chocolate caramel seemed to rise to the top of my list there were definitely some bars that offered more protein or fiber or even less calories or fat but overall this seemed to be the best all around for me it comes in with calories less than most of competitors grams of fat less than a lot of competitors grams of protein more on par with many of its competitors and grams of fiber more than a lot of competitors oh yeah and they taste pretty awesome as well 
positive,3/8/20,my husband worked for this oreintal family who gave him a oz package of noh hawaiian iced tea he raved on how good it was i did not believe him until i actually tried it ummmm great cool taste and refreshing ice tea i would definetely recommend
positive,15/4/19,the aroma is just super the flavor is great also i am using it to make iced tea but i am sure it is good hot also loved by everyone who has tried it has a very mild lemon taste well balanced flavor 
positive,9/3/18,nice assortment one cheese got molded before opening about days after arrival i gourmet replaced it promptly nice grouping for a wine tasting party 
positive,18/5/18,do not be fooled buy the calorie count on this product most people consider low calorie products to be less filling i am surprised at this tasty and filling meal in a can i purchased this item on a whim and glad that i did will purchase again for sure 
positive,9/3/18,quite flavorful it jump starts my day certainly recommend it i like a stout cup of coffee and would definately reorder it again 
positive,27/2/18,these are one of the best tasting potato chips that i have tasted nice and crunchy a little thicker than other chips and just the right amount of salt while these are certainly not a health food the current packaging boasts that they have less fat than regular chips the package also boasts no artificial flavors no preservatives no message no trans fats made with all natural ptotatoes and seasonings one serving has fat of which only is saturated fat sodium sugar and protein for potato chips that is pretty good shop for price the printed price on a oz bag is and i can get these for less on sale at my local supermarket 
positive,20/2/18,went to italy this past summer and again in september so i became addicted to expresso and ordered about worth of pods when i got back and i really really enjoyed this one my father and grandfather also like it born and raised in italy will be ordering again 
positive,22/3/18,i just brewed my first cup and the aroma and flavor both speak of autumn and harvest i love the flavor i would highly recommend this herbal tea 
negative,12/3/18,i tasted wonderful cheese popcorn at the palmer house in chicago and thought this might be the same when sprinkled on hot buttered popcorn sorry i had to purchase six as i cannot even give them away absolutely no taste whatsoever even when you use a massive amount of it on popcorn do not waste your money 
positive,9/2/18,i bought this brand without having tried it beforehand because i could not find any mulling spices in bags in the local grocery stores last month and i was ready for some apple juice and mulling spices it tastes very good much the same as another brand a friend shared with me last year i have tried other instant brands but did not care for them these are perfect for me although the amount i had to buy here on amazon was really more than what i wanted 
positive,7/12/17,these are pretty good some of the individually wrapped pieces must have tiny holes as some of the cookies are no longer crisp and fresh but for the price they are pretty great most of them are good 
positive,24/5/19,these are very good crackers with a very italian cheesy taste all boxes had quite a few crushed at the bottom of the boxes bags bags inside the boxes i liked them much better than just the regular cheddar ones 
positive,9/3/18,this is a very good rice and i will be ordering more good flavor and it is always a surprise at a dinner party 
positive,18/5/18,i do not eat chips often but when i do these are some of my favorites they have all the flavor and texture of traditional tortilla chips but it is the subtle lime flavoring that makes them special the lime flavoring appears to be a seasoning that has been sprinkled on some chips seem to have minimal flavor and i find myself looking for those with the most still none of them have quite enough for my tastes i wish that these chips had more than just a hint of lime 
positive,23/3/18,crust is a little bland but the middle is great i wish it were in stock more often 
positive,8/9/20,these are the best quick boil udons i have ever had the noodles are just right and the soup is pretty good you can also skip the soup base and add your own stuff i like adding tofu and tempura fish balls with my udon if you are fortunate enough to have a ranch market or nijiya market nearby save yourself some money and buy the udon there since they are sold for only cents a pack 
positive,23/2/18,this is an awesome product dissapointed only by cans being dented they were usable though great buy compared to stores 
positive,18/7/20,best tasting green tea around a bit pricey i tried yogi green tea because it was cheaper it was good but not a smooth and rich tasting i will stick with traditional medicinal from now on 
positive,14/6/18,taste like fruit like the texture kind of like gummy bears love the calories great snack and easy to travel with had these before and this is order
positive,2/11/18,i have wanted to find a stevia sweetened soda for a long time but i do not like typical colas or lemon lime soft drinks i had hoped this would taste a little more like that other well known dr drink but to be honest it just does not i guess my slight disappointment with that difference led me to knock off a star in my rating all in all however it is a good flavor bit of a cherry with a hint of citrus 
positive,14/10/18,this is one of zevia s more successful flavors it is more reminiscent of the flavor of dr pepper than a clone but it still tastes very good i do not notice any kind of aftertaste i have bought this on its own before and will again it is one of my favorite flavors 
positive,6/4/20,my only complaint is that on the bottom of the package the expiration date is i do not think that is correct i made several cups of tea before i noticed it and figured that since i had not had any adverse effects either it was incorrect or it did not matter it tastes refreshing and smells great the combination of coconut and green tea is awesome 
positive,9/3/18,these are very good not too sweet like most fig newton type bars and not gritty like some high fiber or high protein bars we eat them for afterschool snacks or breakfast on the run 
positive,18/5/18,these candies are small which i like since i do not want to scarf down a candy bar that has calories these candies are about calories each the flavor is a mix between coffee and cream which you already know but the sugar content is not so large as to make you feel the candies are nothing but sugar you can eat of these candies a day and have no guilt the hardness of the candies is great because they last awhile and unlike other candies they do not stick to your teeth and torture you for minutes geeh i am sounding old but i cannot buy the junk from a vending machine at work and enjoy it and most candies are huge in size and calories so these candies seem to be ideal 
positive,7/3/18,this is the only protein powder that i have used that tastes great even mixed with just cold water and a shaker 
positive,24/1/19,the product taste great for a meal replacement powder this works for me as i work and go to school fulltime and have less time cooking or preparing food it satisfy my appetite for hours 
positive,27/2/19,love this stuff try used shaker cup to mix would recommend using electric wand mixer to create milkshake effect and the chocolately taste is yummy
positive,19/4/20,this is an ideal bar for someone that wants the taste of a nutty candybar but with of protein tastes like a payday high fat and sugar content are the downsides though 
positive,17/4/20,decided to try this out with no information on the product or past experience with the company because i am familiar with powdered soup mix in general and if this one specifically tasted weird i could probably do something myself to make it better the soup is good four stars because the garlic and onion flavors are a bit strong if you are on a low sodium diet you will want to steer clear because the sodium content is pretty high to be expected with a product like this but you never can tell over all i do not regret my purchase and may even buy again in the future 
positive,3/4/20,i love this stuff i brew several pitchers of iced tea from it every day and it has become my standard beverage now i have had plenty of white teas from the various folks who mass produce them like lipton but this is the first time i have bought it loose and brewed it up myself rather than pre brewed or in tea bag form so point is i am an amateur i do not have experience with other loose leaf white teas to compare but i find this stuff divine it is mild yet tasty and i do not ever get any caffeine effects that i notice now if you need something to wake up in the morning i could see that being a problem but as something i drink all day long i definitely do not want to have to worry about getting jittery or cutting myself off at a particular point in the evening i have never had a hard time going to sleep after drinking this tea and that is great in my book there is some debate as to whether white tea has lower caffeine content than other teas like black teas but i can only go by personal experience and personally i find that black teas like english breakfast when i brew them up give me a very noticeable caffeine kick this does not in any way this tea seems great i wish i had the expertise to know whether i am enjoying something that really is awesome or some shoddy imposter that y know simply makes me very happy to drink but has no real quality to it i suspect this is pretty decent quality and i hope once the two pounds run out to try some other brand at least in a limited quantity to see how they stack up to one another oh and a side note turns out throwing out your first brief steep will not make the rest caffeine free read more here if you are interested also one of my favorite aspects of this white tea and i assume it is true of most white teas is that there is almost no bitterness black tea is not exactly like tonic water but it does have a bit of a bitter taste and i found that i really enjoyed it once that bitterness was gone even though i did not know or think that black tea was unpleasantly bitter i now notice it quite a bit a case of one of those you do not know what you could have done without until it is gone sorts of things i guess happy brewing 
positive,7/8/19,i love honey and i often buy expensive gourmet types i decided to try this one because rain forest sounded unusual and also because it is labeled organic this honey met my best expectations it has very nice texture and aroma to it for this price i could not believe it it does taste like a gourmet honey i disagree with one of the previous comments this honey s taste is not overbearing at all good quality honey should have a distinct flavor that is what sets apart honeys coming from different areas and flower types and that easily recognizable flavor is what is valued in each type of honey 
positive,9/3/18,this is a good as it gets next to starbucks and since it is in your own home it is even better 
positive,18/5/18,while the coffee is very tasty with lots of flavor i cannot help being bothered by the high price everywhere on line or in store and the official site has it for box with capsules of which only is the coffee the rest is the milk well we need that too still 
positive,27/1/19,i love all the dolce gusto milky coffees but this is my favorite pricewise and tastewise this beats the expensive coffee shops any day 
negative,10/11/19,the coffee is great tasting but is expensive in my book if nestle had not sent me the machine for free i would not have bought it it leaks and is not a great machine for an office our office does not like it because you have to keep going to the bathroom to refill it with water because it only holds two cups worth of water it does make a hot cup of coffee in a very quick time though 
positive,8/11/19,for a great appetizer stuff these little guys with goat cheese or goat cheese mixed with cream cheese and a little fresh basil just put the cheese and basil in a plastic baggie sqish to mix add mild if too thick cut a corner from the bag and squeeze into the drained peppadews they will be the hit of the dinner party for style points serve in a long skinny olive dish 
positive,25/10/21,these are fantastic better than regular pretzels i was expecting them to be hard and grainy like everything else gf but they were not they are made with potato and corn starch instead of rice flour seriously these are really good 
positive,8/5/20,this cheddar cheese tastes great it is not truly a sharp tangy taste but it is cheddar the drawback is the shipping cost of nearly for eventhough it arrives virtually over night the nutrional label is as follows for a size cube calories total fat saturated fat grams trans fats cholesterol sodium total carbs less than g protein grams this cheese cannot be frozen as the label states it can be stored in the fridge up to one month but we consumed this in a week for a special party i included the nutritional content due to the marketplace did not state the facts when i bought this hopefully this helps other consumers 
positive,28/9/18,i love this stuff it is like the sencha shot but with a bit softer flavor profile still fills in like an energy drink but without the weirdly contrived and overly sweet flavors of those drinks this stuff is also actually good for you 
positive,29/7/19,product tastes really good just like regular pasta if you ask me however it does take twice as long to cook which is fine by me if it has lower carbs 
positive,9/3/18,realllllly good i saw this reviewed on seattle coffee gear s site and being me i thought oo i wonder if its on amazon sure enough they had the whole bean version which i wanted more but but no grinder yet so i bought drip and since i had not tried it before i was wondering if it was really good or if it was just meh this is awesome coffee the drip grind is really great too and strong i learned quick that you do not want to use too much now if your big on strong coffee go nuts i used a cone type filter and used tablespoons and i did not really level off much and it was sooo strong but not bitter it was super smooth and it was chocolaty really good love this coffee plan on buying more if you cannot find it on here just go to their website 
positive,18/5/18,this is a very tasty powdered instant decaf chai tea mix it blends easily and well and tastes delicious i like to take a few packets when i travel
positive,17/5/20,as other reviewers have noted already this seems to be kellogg s attempt to replicate honey nut cheerios at least in appearance nutritionally the two are also very similar crunchy nut tastes sweeter and i found myself eating it as a snack i cannot say the taste is too similar to hnc so just because you like one does not mean you will necessarily like the other overall it is definitely to my liking and i can see myself buying both crunchy nut and hnc 
positive,26/3/20,we cannot believe how flavorful this kraft thick and spicy brown sugar barbecue sauce tastes i used this to cook some very meaty chicken breast and the flavors popped it is not too spicy for us and i assume it is because of the brown sugar you cannot go wrong with buying a product from kraft foods 
positive,24/2/20,i started drinking this tea about weeks ago and have seen my acne slowly fade away my co workers even mentioned how bright my complexion was looking 
positive,3/5/19,all the cures work and taste great i like hickory smoked flavored items so this was great for me great seasoning 
positive,27/3/20,absolutely the best nutella alternative i actually prefer it over nutella it tastes so rich and just plain phenomenal a bit more hazelnutty than nutella gah just great 
positive,31/12/20,great size to try out xylitol before making a larger commitment i like that it is birch and not corn and made in usa you should be aware that xylitol has a spearmint type sweetness to it it may alter the taste of some foods because of this trait i use it in my coffee as a substitute for regular sugar and i am completely satisfied you need to add slightly more to get the same level of sweetness but its close 
positive,13/1/20,these bars all of the roll types are hard to eat that is actually part of why i like them so much because they take some effort to bite into and chew they basically force you to eat slower as a result you feel more satisfied at the end of eating one than if you had scarfed down a candy bar in three bites i do not find them hard as rocks though just very chewy if you do not like chewy food then these are definitely not for you i also really like the texture contrast between the crunchy crispy outside and the chewy nougat inside of the bar there is a bit of a mess factor involved in eating these as noted by one reviewer the caramel is sticky and sometimes leaves traces on the wrapper and the outside crispy crunchy coating tends to crumble off a bit if you want to keep the inside of your car spotlessly clean you might not want to chow down on a go lean roll bar while driving nevertheless i still think these are some of the best bars out there they are not discernibly chalky nor do they have a strange chemical aftertaste the way that many protein or energy bars do they really are like fortified candy bars and they pack quite a high protein and fiber punch for only calories each while only having about mg of sugars about tablespoon per bar i was expecting more like mg when i tried my first one the chocolate turtle roll is my favorite flavor but honestly i have tried every single flavor of the go lean roll bars and they are really all quite good 
positive,21/9/20,i have been receiving this product via auto delivery for about a year now i try to eat one of these bars as my lunch at least days a week it tastes like a candy bar and provides enough fiber protein etc to replace a meal i think it is a great way to help me lose weight 
positive,2/12/20,my wife and i are senior citizens on a fixed income though not as fixed as it was six months ago if you are like us and looking for a reasonably priced and tasty source of protein in a well rounded package with other vital nutrients look no further this stuff is delicious do not be surprised when unsuspecting dinner guests ask for the recipe we just reply that it is a family secret the only con i can think of is having to choose between the beef the lamb and the turkey but why choose just buy all three 
positive,20/11/19,this dressing is awesome it is very tasty and not so full of chemical ingredients as other dressings we wish we would have discovered it earlier 
positive,2/12/20,i love the taste of this green tea it has a natural sweet mango taste and not the bitterness of plain green tea i use bags to make a pot great tasting and good for you 
positive,11/12/19,i love to eat it as a snack while reading before i know it the jar is empty but i buy it from plum market online for 
positive,20/11/19,as a big fan of arnold palmers half lemonade half iced tea over ice i am pleased with this k cup variety i add a bit of sugar after brewing it over a big cup filled with ice and its a great alternative to soda or trying to mix an arnold palmer myself at home 
negative,28/6/20,thought it tastes funny not like iced tea not like lemonade and no where in between there are much better flavors out there
positive,8/8/20,i just ordered these vanilla caramels along with a bag of the sea salt kind although i am more partial to the sea salt avenuesweets caramels these are also great very fresh soft and chewy with a hint of vanilla 
positive,14/7/21,i cannot get decaf at the stores here and love this tea i am now well supplied and can share a box or with friends you can make it with just water or for a special treat use milk add some honey and top with whipped cream very decadent the price is very good and i got free shipping 
positive,2/12/20,this is some of the smoothest coffee i have ever tasted for people who do not really like the taste of coffee i would highly recommend this coffee it does not have any bitter aftertaste it really is incredibly smooth 
positive,20/11/19,i tried congo bongo in my friend s house and absolutely love it but since i prefer green tea i have ordered fiji it has great taste hope the quality of the tea also good love fiji and going to try some other flavor from serendipitea 
positive,1/3/21,i bought these in response to a just for you recommendation and was very pleased the product was fresh and gummy not stale at all i was surprised at how brightly colored these bears are i admire their tasty tasty glow just before i pop them into my mouth i was home when the box arrived and since it was a warm day i was glad i was the bears were crammed together at one end of the packaging and very warm so i popped the unopened bag into the fridge for a while when they had cooled i opened the bag it is not a resealable bag and divided the bears into ziplocs eating the ones that fell onto the counter for ummmm health and safety reasons hopefully this will keep them fresh a long while 
positive,5/5/21,this is the only food i have been feeding my dog since i took him off puppy chow he loves it his coat is soft and shiny and i have not had any health problems he is a year old mini dachshund so this small breed formula works well for him 
positive,2/12/20,i cannot believe how great this water is i got the apple pear flavored water and am really into it i put a couple into the freezer and get them super cold and then take them with me for the day i also really love the way the bottle fits into a back pocket let us me be hands free 
negative,20/11/19,i did not like the taste of this very much it was ok but it tasted a little odd i loved their white lightening chicken chili but do not recommended the chicken noodle soup 
positive,9/10/21,ultra light weight and real live fruit a great combination the fruit is freeze dried for those of you that remember space ice cream it is the same idea the fruit is sliced and placed in a machine that freezes the fruit and then a vacuum pulls off the water the process retains a lot of the original flavor and preserves the fruit for almost eternity well about two years expiration date on the pouches without using any chemicals the taste is really nice these are all crisp fruit pieces not the gummy fruit leather food banana strawberry is probably the tastiest and most fragile the strawberry flavor is strong and the bananas are subtle without picking up the strawberry flavor apples come in a nice second the pieces are thick and about two inches in diameter the pears are good maybe a touch tart and have the same texture as the apples the fruit is completely dry and absorbs water in your mouth very quickly if you eat it too fast the strawberries coat your teeth a little bit the others are very clean to eat i like these packages in my carryon bag for plane trips they make a great emergency snack take up little space and weigh nothing number two son packs these in his lunch almost every day now he likes the strawberry banana the best i really like all three flavors the pouches list that they are a product of china i list that as information so you can be aware of where this fruit comes from and make no value judgment for you the manufacturing process has been around for a very long time it is a very safe process and as long as the fruit going in is good the food should be good so far every pouch has been consistently good i like these a lot they make a great snack 
positive,6/3/21,the dried fruit are very tasty the individual pkgs are handy and convenient great for people on the go i recommend this product 
positive,12/2/21,whoa a really nice sweetness it is softer than the raw organic cane sugar i am presently using and it has no aftertaste i never could get used to stevia in my coffee but this is delicious just a very good product 
positive,2/12/20,this is a staple item at our house i use it in soups barbecue meatloaf and anything else that we want to spice up pure tasting w o any other spices overpowering the flavor you apply as much heat as you desire and still maintain the integrity of your recipe the small jars were timely and intact when delivered 
positive,20/11/19,i have tried many pancake batters and this one is up there as one of the best great flavor the texture is a little fluffy and stretchy but maybe because i added an extra egg the batter needs a lower cooking temperature though otherwise it burns rather easily easy to work with though and best of all no sugar only granulated honey 
positive,25/6/21,these are fantastic they are a good price for what you get i made sugar cookies and the kids drew on them 
positive,17/3/20,the taste of gloria jean s butter toffee is so wonderful as soon as it begins to brew you can smell it throughout the kitchen the taste is deep rich and sweet 
positive,20/10/21,gloia jeans butter toffee coffee has a great taste the smell of the aroma as the coffee brews starts an enjoyable experience sit back relax and enjoy a cup 
positive,21/7/20,this is a very tasty tea i served it at a bridal shower and it was one of the favorites my husband loved it and took the remaining tea bags to work we will be ordering more 
positive,22/2/21,my grandson loves the strawberry kellogg s special k bars but the strawberry flavored are sometimes difficult to find in the grocery store i was thrilled to find them on amazon and be able to buy them by the case on a regular basis heaven forbid that nana be caught without a strawberry breakfast bar at all times 
positive,8/6/21,my first time eating kelp noodles they taste great now i just need to find them locally so that i will not have to place an order for food nevertheless recommend this company and their kelp 
positive,2/12/20,this is by far the best teriyaki jerky i have tasted it is a thick cut salty sweet and tender the price is the only thing that is no good i would buy more if it was bulk or reasonable but this seems to be the only place to purchase i am a repeat customer and will continue thanks 
negative,20/11/19,like eating soft plastic we pored them in a big pile in the back yard under the trees the squeals will not eat them 
positive,25/1/21,i have been a marzipan fanatic for over years while there are finer and fancier marzipans in my opinion for the money this is a very nice dependable product i buy a pound wedge every year and make candy gifts for family and friends and always get compliments and cheers if you are a serious gourmet you might not care for it but for most people for general use it is quite nice 
positive,1/7/21,only calories and no trans or saturated fat i love these things but i cannot eat just one so watch out 
positive,30/9/20,i was following a diet where no sugar was allowed i tried this product and it has a good taste with out sugar i also used to put some other mint flavor herb tea mixed with this to get my own flavor worth trying 
negative,15/3/20,well do you know how difficult it is to find white rice puffed rice only company that does it is quaker millet does not cut it sorry will not but it again have tried all the puffed rice products most do not tell you that these puffed rice products are brown rice puffed rice truth in advertising i think not brown rice puffed just does not have the taste of white rice puffed i can still find it at albertsons at around bucks a box 
positive,6/7/21,i ordered this for my diabetic daughter i found some not so great reviews from people so i only ordered one bottle my whole family loves this stuff i even like it and i am not a sno cone fan it has an excellent flavor the syrup is light and does not overtake the ice i will order all of my syrups from back to basics sugar free collection from now on i highly reccoment this product 
positive,29/6/21,i add this to my kids milk for added protein and calcium it clumps together so you have to mix it up in a blender but it tastes great and is worth the price to avoid hormones in non organic milk it is hard to find around here and i am glad amazon carries it they offer it cheaper than special ordering it from the health food store i add it to homemade icing and ice cream too 
positive,29/6/21,great seller a great customer service outstanding value good tasting italian coffee i will be back after i drink all of my coffee that i purchased to purchase another back from the seller i have advise you people to do the same 
positive,26/7/21,these are awesome our golden lab loves them and eats one daily they definitely make his breath smell better which is why we got them in the first place great product not smelly to humans do not make a mess when eating 
positive,21/10/21,i have never had mallomars before i live in wisconsin and do not know if they make it all the way over here the only time i ever remember hearing the name before is in the simpsons episode hurricane neddy when nice guy flanders finally snaps and cusses out the whole town upon getting to the portly police chief wiggum he says the only case you have gotten to the bottom of was a case of mallomars i assume by what i have read that they are a fall only type product like the mcrib i am also informed by the box that they are a new york kind of thing regardless i am glad vine gave me the chance to try them because they are so good the crunchy dark chocolate coating over a marshmallow lump and thin crunchy cookie gives a s mores like experience that truly satisfies an excellent snack buy a box today 
positive,25/10/21,i was told about this stuff at a party and as a lover of mayonnaise thought i would buy some i do not use it a lot but it is pretty good on fries i imagine it will make a great tunafish sandwich too if you have never had it before it tastes a lot like traditional mayo but considerably more vinegar y some people who do not like mayo have told me they like this 
positive,29/6/21,i discovered these at my local trader joe s but then they stopped carrying them i hunted and located them under their original colors they make a very tasty vegetable broth carrot and onion flavors are not too strong as in some other broths 
positive,5/7/21,i enjoy bloodymary s but at times making a mix from scratch is too timely so i settle for something different i have tried several other bloody mixes with poor results the zing zang bloody mix is the closest i have come to homemade it is extremely tasty no more skipping an urge for a bloody when this mix is at hand highly recommend
positive,17/9/21,this is the easiest and tastiest applesauce cake with out the hassle everyone will think you made it fromscratch 
positive,18/8/21,this is a great chai tea it is very aromatic and flavorful but not overpowering strong like some can be 
positive,31/7/21,this sauce with lobster added was the hit of the night paired with pasta and garlic bread my family could not stop raving about it i managed to save one jar for myself 
positive,18/10/21,despite the poor review below this instant udon bowl is suprisingly delicious this instant udon bowl is so delicious most people cannot tell the difference between udon served at a restaurant and the udon from this bowl i love adding an egg to my meal with this udon i just plop it in there with bowling water and boom fresh udon with egg cannot be beat enjoy 
positive,29/6/21,i used to be able to buy this in the grocery stores but no longer i do not know why since it is the best pepper out there for cooking and flavoring it is easy to use grind is just right and more flavorful than bland black pepper i use it in salads and whenever i am adding pepper to a recipe 
positive,16/9/21,it is hard to rate and review a cheez it if you like the white cheddar or monterey jack kind then you will like this one too these are just a little bit milder 
positive,24/8/21,the new cheez it mozzarella flavored crackers are great tasting the crunch was transformed into a creamy cheese flavor as i greedily shoveled them into my mouth i had to shovel them because the crackers were broken into crumbs when i received them this however in no way detracted from the flavor or deterred me from the swift completion of my appointed task wait i think i missed one mmmmm
positive,24/6/21,i came home from a hot morning in the arizona sun and opened my illy issimo coffee drink nice and cold from the fridge i found the expresso taste strong but refreshing and the amount of sweetness just right great product 
positive,27/9/21,very deep and tasty caffe drink it is got just a hint of sweetness and a hint of chocolate taste not too much fat and less sugar than most drinks of this type even my husband who does not like coffee likes it it reminds me of a starbucks double shot but less sweet and it has less cream i would definitely buy these and try them again 
positive,29/6/21,switched to this melitta lite coffee from dunkin donuts coffee delicious flavorful smooth brew without leaving jangly coffee nerves or early morning digestive difficulties the low acid and reduced caffeine really help highly recommend 
negative,5/8/21,very little taste weak and no caffiene that i can tell i even emailed tao of tea about brewing suggestions and got no reply 
positive,29/6/21,my year old has been eating this soup since she was about year old she absolutely loves it and so do i it is organic and very healthy with lower sodium than just about any other canned soup on the market 
positive,31/7/21,great way for kids to get in their fruits and veggies i add to yogurt smoothies 
positive,11/9/21,my husband and i love to cook jarred sun dried tomatoes available in our area grocery stores have been a disappointment not these flavorful and easy to use in a variety of dishes the flavor is a burst of summer sweetness often these are eaten as chef s treats during cooking price is more than fair i will keep these on hand always 
positive,12/8/21,this tea is very flavorful the pyramidal tea bags seem to allow more flavor to infuse i would buy this again 
positive,31/7/20,i love this balsamic vinager it has a great flavor on par with some of the more expensive ones i have tried 
positive,13/6/20,not to sweet not too bitter the blueberry is not overbearing but yet you know it is there overall i like it 
positive,31/7/20,i like cashews any way so i am biased i really enjoyed these they do earn the name of salty though so this product is not for those that need to eat low sodium but for the rest of us they will be a tasty treat 
positive,13/6/20,i was pleasantly surprised by this product i like salt and pepper flavors in general but this one has a bit garlic and onion flavor to it that i liked a lot the pepper is not too hot but it gives it a nice kick the pepper flavor does not compare with freshly ground pepper naturally but it is pretty good for a commercially made product it is a tiny bit too salty for my taste but i know that tends to be personal preference that is different for everybody the nuts are well roasted and crunchy they are also a really nice size too often i see tiny nuts that do not have much flavor these nuts are tasty i would get these again these would be an interesting snack to serve to guests 
positive,26/9/20,i have been partial to emerald s products so my favorable reaction to this one comes as no surprise to me however i would warn that this may not be to everyone is taste at least at first the sea salt definitely has more kick than the usual salted nuts and the pepper gives it a decided bite for those whose taste in nuts tend more towards sweeter concoctions this may be a bit much but for those who like dark beer strong coffee and snacks with attitude this is a welcome treat 
positive,17/10/20,first of all i am a cashew lover so i figured i would like these nuts what i did not expect was how much i would like the sea salt pepper combo there is a slight twang after eating a handful of these and they are great with a cold beer or soda each nut is big and bold no little pieces in this jar the packaging is great good for taking along on trips the twist lid is easy on and off if you enjoy spice go for these the pepper does give a little extra kick 
positive,14/12/20,i ordered this from another website and my newly diagnosed to need to be gluten free year old son loved it when returning to the other site to no longer find it there i returned to my old friend amazon com i am impressed with all the gf products that i can get on here and even more excited that i can use the subscribe and save option to have a continuous supply of mac n cheese always in our house thanks 
positive,29/5/20,just tried my first cup and it is as good as the restaurant stuff i typically pay a premium for for with ice i am loving it update i tried the pantainorasingh brand which is not nearly as good as this brand sadly i may end up throwing away the other brand even though i hate to be wasteful the taste is very different 
positive,9/12/20,this tea is very tasty it does not have the unappealing fresh paint smell that some other thai tea mixes have i am very pleased with it i agree with the other reviewer that the price is high for shipping in my area i could not find it in the asian stores so i have to order it for three bags the shipping was just more than the shipping for one bag so i bought three to offset the shipping cost i also agree with one of the other reviewers that the tea should be brewed very strongly then add water or milk to it later i love the tea hot or cold with or without cream the lovely orange color shows up better when you use cream or milk and the color is part of the charm of the drink 
positive,4/8/20,i do not know if this product tastes exactly like the thai tea in the restaurants nor do i know if i am brewing the tea exactly the way they do but it tastes very good and i look forward to drinking it it is a personal treat it is best served with regular half and half not milk or fat free half and half i brew it using my coffee maker i put the filter paper just as if i were about to brew some coffee i use my judgement with the amount of tea to water ratio and i can now visualize the amount i need for a specific strength all in all it is a good product only had a problem with the shipping i live in nyc and will perhaps search for this product in china town next time but until then i have two bags to keep me busy 
negative,31/7/20,it is not worth the money it does have a terrible taste i bought one so far and stopped buying it and threw the unused coffee in garbage if you want a good tasting instant coffee try nescafe classic or nescafe gold available everywhere on earth but parts of the us 
positive,13/6/20,i have a puppy that absolutely loves them she considers them her personal reward for everything she does a good training aid 
positive,21/11/20,i am more concerned with sugar than fat and this is a great sugar free item best tasting creamer without sugar not too sweet just perfect 
positive,25/5/21,i have been searching for a good tasting protein drink since i had a gastric bypass years ago i saw this product on another weight loss surgery blog and decided to give it a try you can drink it warm unlike most other protein drinks or cold and it mixes quite easily if you use a container with a blender ball i thought it was a bit too thick when i mixed it according to the directions scoops in oz of water so the next time i used more water others might prefer the thicker version though i also added crushed ice after i mixed it which kept it cold longer and made it more like an iced coffee drink when i travel i take my empty blender ball container in my carryon bag stuffed with ziploc bags filled with protein shake powders but on my next trip will be taking these packets instead 
positive,25/5/21,i was just introduced to these olives on a united flight this week probably the best tasting green olives i have ever had i usually never eat green olives i was so happy with them i purchased two snack pack boxes with the olove packs on my return flight to share with my wife and kids i am thrilled i am able to purchase these on amazon and really suggest them to anyone looking for a great snack 
positive,20/1/21,i used this in cakes cup cakes and candies its great in drinks i found as well as long as your making mixed drinks i really enjoyed this produce and i urge people to try this and experiment with it be adventurous with your cooking and the flavors you use its truly worth it 
negative,15/1/21,tasted bland did not have the freshness and aroma of sping onions would not buy again
positive,8/2/21,my dog loves them loves them loves them i find them a bit pungent they are fish after all but my opinion is not the one that counts 
positive,10/2/21,we picked some of these up this week they are very convenient and quite handy to have around just to grab when you are walking out the door the taste is about what you would expect from hershey s chocolate milk it is chocolate it is sweet and it is really good it is nice that they do not need to be refrigerated either at least until after they are opened on the one hand these are better for a child than cola but on the other hand there is still a lot of sugar in them and calories in only oz i am looking at the servings right now and for one container it has g of sugar i will grant you it is not empty calories because there is of the daily intake of calcium but still if you can train the kid to drink skim milk that is fewer calories for them when i was a kid my parents used to give me skim milk with not much chocolate powder in it my real treat was the chocolate milk at school but it was fairly rare to get it they would have chocolate milk maybe once a week these things probably are not all that bad by comparison to some of the junk food kids eat i just feel a little wary if feeding them lunch for lunch because the calories do add up i would never tell anybody how to raise their kids or what to drink themselves but i for one plan to have these as a treat every now and then instead of as a regular part of my diet anyway they are tasty and i would recommend 
positive,9/10/20,my wife does not like chocolate but she likes granola i love chocolate and i am fine with granola here is a granola snack we can agree on she tasted it and pronounced it pretty good i am a big fan of chocolate bars with add ins like bacon or fruit or chili so chocolate with berries is right up my alley i like it and i do not have to feel guilty when i eat it now if i can just get our year old to try some i can share the whole family s opinion 
positive,31/7/20,i am always looking for healthy snack alternatives but healthy snacks are not always very tasty this one was it has a good crunch factor and the chocolate and berry flavors stood out without being overpowering my two teen aged sons fought over the bag one enjoyed is as a cereal the other just as a snack i myself enjoyed it sprinkled over some fat free frozen yogurt the serving size cup is a little small it would be easy to eat the whole bag without even realizing it but it is perfect as a topping for yogurt or ice cream my boys have asked me to add this to my regular shopping list 
positive,13/6/20,i bought this product as a gift for my son who is away at college he liked the tea and enjoyed having a varity to pick from i will re order this again two thumbs up 
positive,5/12/20,this mix is exactly as advertised i decided to add chopped onion sesame seeds and a small amount of chile paste and the results were outstanding i also used lbs of ahi instead of the full lb and it worked fine i would buy this product again 
positive,1/11/20,without my miracle noodles i would go crazy my cravings pasta are under control with miracle noodles they are delicious with any sauce or olive oil 
negative,14/1/21,honestly i used to buy this frequently before they stopped caring it in my grocery store so i was actually quite excited to see its availibility online i am not exactly sure what is up with it but it has absolutely no taste whatsoever very big disappointment o 
positive,6/6/21,this is a chocolate donut flavored coffee it is not pre sweetened has a great aroma and flavor it is perfect for someone who likes it dark or likes to add cream and or sugar on his or her own i have tried other flavors like this and this one is by far the best 
positive,21/7/20,we love k cups and the ease of using them the donut house collection chocolate glazed donut is great tasting i would highly recommend these k cups
positive,5/1/21,this coffee is excellent it is a lighter blend so those who prefer chewable coffee may not like it it has an amazing scent of a chocolate donut i am new to the k cup but so far this is one of my favorite flavors 
positive,23/1/21,i got a really good deal of this item in amazon amazon provides must cheaper price than local stores the noodle includes two separate soup powders that make the taste so amazing 
positive,31/7/20,fairly easy to cook a little nutty in taste for some 
positive,13/6/20,these flakes are smaller than i expected for something called large but they taste great straight out of the package throw them in your hot or cold cereal on top of ice cream or mix them into yogurt they are a sweet crunchy healthy treat 
positive,1/12/20,this was good honey in a nice package i used it as a compliment for the beer i made called honey britches i taped the sticks to the side of the bottles and it added a nice little sweetness to the beer that already used orange honey in the brew process honey ferments completely so there was very little residual sugar left which this item helped remedy 
positive,30/1/21,this is my favorite snack bar the price is about the same as the sale prices i find at the supermarket on a per unit basis 
positive,1/1/21,at cents a piece these are a good deal they contain all natural ingredients which sounds like something for a tree hugger which i am not it actually makes them good and not disgusting like some other granola type bars i am torn between the apple pie ones and these which are both the same price one of each makes a good cheap lunch 
positive,11/1/21,the cinnamon roll flavors are not quite as good as the other larabars there is just not enough cinnamon for my tastes however they are still very tasty 
positive,31/7/20,several people have written in to say that their larabars were old and crumbly i just received a box of chocolate coconut chew larabars and they are in date moist have a good consistency and are delicious this is a perfect mid morning or after workout snack i love that they are raw vegan kosher contain all natural ingredients and have no processed sugar these taste better are healthier and have a better texture than most lines of exercise oriented energy bars 
positive,13/6/20,best energy bar ever healthy tasty less than ingredients what could be better than that great taste too 
positive,14/1/21,i am a marathon runner and diabetic i have spent years tinkering with different energy meal bars and eventually settled with clifbar which is not bad though it has many sugary ingredients like rice syrup etc i was extremely excited to discover larabar it is delicious contains no added sugars and provides an excellent source of energy for training definitely the best bar on the market 
positive,7/12/20,this bar is good it tastes like eating a banana mixed in with some nuts i like that it does not have any sugar added and it just uses the natural sugars from the banana to flavor the bar 
positive,5/5/21,i was so hoping that starbucks would come out with a mild blend for k cups starbucks has exceeded my hopes this coffee is delicious thanks starbucks
positive,23/11/20,great to have a sugar that tastes great cooks with everything and has not yet been cooped by the gmo crowd of producers we will order again and enjoyed the speedy delivery we wish this came in larger bags for truly bulk orders lbs bags would be great 
positive,29/8/20,not my favorite but for the price great product and it is handy stores well and works well in coffee and other foods i have added distilled water and used in my cereal straight is fine but i am calorie conscious so i prefer to add a little water organic valley is the best but for obvious reasons it cost more 
positive,18/1/21,my year old really likes them they are worth the price good packing and fresh to taste i highly recommend this product 
positive,18/6/21,i have never used gluten free pasta before i absolutely love this pasta i enjoy eating spaghetti once in a while and this satisfies that craving it is very important to make sure the water is boiling prior to putting in the pasta i say this because my daughter decided to make spaghetti for herself and added pasta in pan of water before it was boiling well what happened was a glob of gooey mess lesson learned 
positive,18/6/21,i made this purchase for a visiting relative and although i did not drink it she enjoyed the tea very much and ordered her own when she returned home 
positive,7/7/21,i received this product as part of the amazon vine program this lipton to go decard tea is good and is refreshing i wished it had less ingredients but overall is a better alternative to soda pop and less calories 
positive,18/6/21,i really liked the taste of this i mixed it with water bottles cold from the refrigerator i found it took quite a bit of shaking to mix the powder in and never did get it completely dissolved as there were still tiny bits that settled to the bottom i think if you drink some from the bottle before adding the drink mix it would allow more room for mixing in the bottle the strawberry taste was excellent not too sweet and no strange aftertaste i really like that it is low calorie without artificial sweetner it makes drinking my daily intake of water easier the packets are small enough to tuck in a pocket for use on the go the package has a notch to make opening easier i will definitely buy these i would have given five starsnif it was easier to dissolve 
positive,7/7/21,this product has great taste and not too sweet the tea mixes up in your water like coolaide and comes in individual packets so you can take it along with you however the packets do not tear by hand but you must use a knife or scissors to get them open that is the only thing that needs to be improved 
positive,1/7/21,this tastes like a tropical cocktail all it needs is the alcohol did not try adding that the mango flavor is pungent and if you like that flavor you will like this tea very enjoyable taste 
positive,7/7/21,when i try a powdered drink mix i am interested in three factors first i want the stuff to taste good second i want it to dissolve well third i would rather drink something without a lot of calories this drink satisfied all three conditions for me so i would be interested in buying more in the future the drink tastes good it is a little sweet for one packet mixed into a drinking glass but there are enough fruit flavors to make the sweetness a bit complex and worth tasting i did not taste the pineapple at all but the mango flavor was nice and pronounced not quite overwhelmed by the honey taste it does not taste like home brewed iced tea but it was closer than i expected from a powdered mix the box warns that the powder needs some extra mixing to fully dissolve but i had no problem at all stirring it in a glass for a couple of seconds there was no grainy layer at the bottom of the glass and my drink was smooth finally each packet is only ten calories so this still counts as a viable low calorie alternative to soft drinks there are lower calorie sweeteners out there but ten is close enough to zero that this mix is a viable beverage for those who prefer to drink water most of the time this is not a must drink experience but it is very good by powdered drink mix standards and i recommend it 
positive,23/7/21,this has lots of flavor and is great that it is decaf i do not like drinking caffeine throughout the day i would recommend this as it is easy to carry with you in your purse briefcase or tote bag and it adds a lot of flavor to your water it only adds calories though great stuff 
positive,20/7/21,normally i just do not like powdered drink mixes but these are really good the package says that half a packet is for ounces of water and has two servings per packet i used them in of water the first time however it was sweet enough that i cut back to a little more than half a packet for and it still had a nice sweetness it is a great product and i would purchase it without any reservation 
positive,19/7/21,i often buy products like this to use when traveling because it is cheaper to buy a case of water and use a drink mix than to buy sodas and drinks on the road this tasted like fresh brewed tea and disolved completely i was not stuck with a residue on the bottom just the right sweetness level and a tasty mix of strawberry flavor 
positive,18/6/21,i was surprised at how good this tasted it is sweet and you can really taste the pineapple it also has only calories per serving better than soda and it mixes well in water the tea also does not have that strong instant tea after taste i would definately buy this again 
positive,7/7/21,this has a great flavor if you are concerned about what you give your kids and do not like all the extras that are put into kids foods you will love this i have been looking for these for a while my kids love the flavor of these in their lunchbox and i do too they taste fine with no extra junk in them 
positive,27/6/21,the packaging makes this great on the go the applesauce is tasty i think it is green apples so it has a little green apple taste but not sour kids like it and like the squeezy action involved the amount is great for a quick snack it would be easy to use while walking runny biking as an alternative to the energy shot gel things that some people like to use 
positive,21/7/21,taste is much better than competing brands and has a good shelf life subscribe and save let us you be sure to always have the right amount on hand at the best price 
positive,18/6/21,we have been getting these crisps for some time now and we love them i also ordered some for my granddaughter they make a great healthy treat for her and she loves them too 
positive,7/7/21,it tastes great dissolves just fine and provides the jolt i need to start my day 
positive,30/6/21,when i was a kid post used to make a cereal called c w post it was a granola type cereal that was the absolute best it disappeared from the grocery shelves sometime in the s fast forward to today walking down the grocery isle i noticed the single row of just bunches high on the grocer s shelf over the years i had tried to find a granola cereal that could live up to the legend of the c w from my childhood sampling all that i could find i had no luck equaling that wonderful crunchy taste likely this new find just bunches would also disappoint but i figured i should give it a try to see if it came at least close to what i remembered it was from the post people perhaps they reached deep into their cereal recipe box and revived an old flavor from the past one could only hope it the parking lot of the grocery i cracked open the box to give it a taste instantly i was transported back to my childhood munching on cereal and watching saturday morning cartoons the road runner bugs bunny it all came back i had found the holy grail of cereals ok maybe that is taking it too far but man its really good so good i subscribed for auto ship every month 
positive,1/7/21,so far these have become my favorite granola bar from nature valley or anywhere else i just discovered them a few months ago and since my supply was getting low i went to wally world today and bought them out except for one box that was way in the back and beyond my reach sometimes i will have one in the morning and do not feel hungry for hours they are very crunchy and take awhile to chew since i do not want to do any damage to my teeth and also have high fructose corn syrup wish it was honey instead but i like them 
positive,24/8/21,very tasty it is hard to find something which has as much protein as sugars i just wish that the sugars were really sugar instead of corn syrup also it would taste even better in my opinion if it had as much sugar but still the best snack bar out there 
negative,21/7/21,i have a picky dog with tummy troubles who has to eat a prescription diet she loves the newman s treats but they are too hard for her since she is missing half her teeth still occasionally i hear a crunching sound and she is munching down a newman s i was hoping she would knaw on these treats and thought the center would be a little easier to eat here is how the trial went me opening the bag you want a treat dog tail wagging ears perked up and looking at me intently me i pull one treat from the bag and hand it to her dog she takes it carefully and sets it on the floor sniff sniff she looks back up at me sniff she walks away and lays down in her bed me i pick up the treat and sniff and do not smell anything this does not mean much since i am not a dog i pull on the outside wrapping it is pretty tough i push the middle up a little it is hard i was expecting a softer middle i taste the middle it is tasteless i tried again to tempt her with one of these treats by giving it to her in place of our nightly bite of cheese ritual once again she just sniffed of it and then ignored it the other treats i have tried with her beggin strips puperoni blue bison apple yogurt biscuits milk bone she will either attempt to eat or carry around in her mouth for several minutes looking for a safe place to hide it these treats do not even get the honor of being buried 
positive,25/6/21,i had a recipe for a pear pomegranate pie which required this ingredient i also used it in a blood orange pomegranate fennel shallot beet feta cheese and toasted almond salad i served both of these with a crown roast of pork with cumberland sauce for christmas dinner this molasses is sour and sweet simultaneously and imparts an interesting taste but could if used too lavishly overhwhelm a dish 
positive,13/9/21,this is my favourite tea at work i sometimes cannot get to it right away and it does not matter how long it sits it does not get that bitter bitter like your drinking a dandelion taste it is refreshing and i cannot start my day without it 
positive,18/6/21,i do not eat right at all i am very picky and i use these to supplement my diet great source of vitamins for on the go i actually drink one for breakfast and one before bed i buy at sams in bulk
positive,7/7/21,the taste of the onions in this first jar is not up to the standards i have come to expect with my many jars that i have purchased through the years 
positive,15/7/21,having usually eating store baught peanuts i would have to say the taste was much to my supprise very fresh and tasty their about times bigger than regular peanuts i am glad i got them with the skins they were very tasty the salt just right 
positive,11/7/21,i cannot get this panda express in stores or restaurant locations anymore it is fantastic stir fry sauce i ordered it on amazon price was good and shipping was fast will be ordering again 
positive,7/10/21,these cheese balls are hard to find and these are so good they melt in your mouth and are very cheesy if you love cheese this is a must buy 
positive,6/7/21,everyone that tastes these chips love them they all ask where they can get them thank you for the email on when they were back in stock i will be ordering more my grandkids children raid the cupboards for them when they come by 
positive,18/6/21,i have bought a few of these along the years just from local stores and the flavor has been hit or miss but these are great hold flavor and gives the right amount of heat to your food i will buy this product again once i run out be sure to keep in fridge or freezer to keep oils fresh 
positive,7/7/21,i ate some raw and roasted most of them at low temp and put in the frig nuts can go rancid so have a plan to preserve and store in frig or freezer when buying this amount of nuts good buy tasted fresh 
positive,27/7/21,mi del old fashion swedish style lemon snaps are a crispy chewy lemony delight if you are always in search of healthy snacks that are not short on flavor these are the cookies for you these lemon snaps are made with organic unbleached wheat flour canola oil and natural lemon flavor there is no artificial lolly pop lemon taste here you can just imagine squeezing the lemon into the mix yourself five cookies have calories so it is not too much for a little something to get you through your day or after dinner as a light dessert without the guilt highly recommended yum 
positive,13/7/21,i had a variety of granola and this one ranks of my top most favorites it is a very crunch granola with a coconut main taste it is sweet but not overly so i eat at as a snack when i am craving something fills you up very fast and satisfies any sugar cravings 
positive,13/9/21,this chipotle sauce is very tasty and it can be used with many different things however i loved it the most with vegetarian meat i am a vegetarian living healthy and all grins and this sauce is amazing in a veggie sandwich or with cooked vegetarian meat however this sauce is very fattening hence why i took one star out it contains grams of fat in tbsp so one needs to be careful to have it in very small portions or make sure to have a good workout session after indulging in a good hearty meal containing this sauce overall i love this chipotle sauce very tasty 
positive,7/9/21,i have tried using this on chicken and hamburgers and really liked it it is a nice change from ketchup and bbq sauces the chipotle has a spicy tang but it is overwhelming it is probably even milder than the spicy sauces in an actual taco bell restaurant it actually has a slightly sweet taste it is a bit salty and creamy for those who are health conscious but i find that even a small bit provides a lot of flavor and can be spread quite far over your meal the bottle seems a bit smaller than you might expect but other than that i would recommend this 
positive,17/4/21,mexican spices are so good on many foods this chipolte sauce has a great flavor unlike other hot sauces not very hot quite mild but intense i have put it on everything not just tacos 
positive,10/3/21,i was pleasantly surprised by the taste of the chipotle sauce it is kind of like a spicy mayonnaise i used this sauce in tuna salad on sandwiches and as a salad dressing similar to mayo almost all of the calories come from fat i think it is tastier than mayo and has a nice amount of spice you can taste the pepper in the sauce but it does not leave your mouth burning it is a good balance of flavors 
positive,17/4/21,i cannot say i would have purchased this in the store but having received it to taste and test out at home was certainly worthwhile surprisingly flavorful with a slight kick at the end this sauce makes a great accompaniment to chicken sandwiches salads even chili yum yum 
positive,21/1/21,this sauce tastes pretty good it is creamy spicy but not overly so and has a nice flavor that pairs well with burritos and other mexican style foods that said i think it is a little bit overpriced for what it is the bottle is quite small fluid ounces is the two thirds the size of a soda can so the amount of sauce you get really is not very much at all they make the bottle wide and skinny so that it has the appearance of capacity the concave curves on the side further deceive the eye so in summary what we have here is a tasty sauce offered for a high price i would recommend perhaps looking for a single bottle at your local supermarket before committing to an entire six pack to see if the flavor is worth the cost for you 
positive,30/1/21,this is a great tasting product it can be used on more than just mexican food tried it on hot dogs and it was great not too spicy give it a try 
positive,13/2/21,this taco bell chipotle sauce is quite enjoyable and has the tangy yet not very spicy taste you would expect i have used it on burritos and as a dip there is no question that if you like the flavor of chipotle sauce you will enjoy this but it is high in calories which i expected and did not mind for you do not need a lot too enjoy the flavor yet two tablespoons of this sauce contains calories from fat and a total of calories per serving size the serving size is the aforementioned two tablespoons it taste great just be aware of its high fat content and calories when serving size is measured by the spoon full you know the calories are high and even so i would get this product again 
positive,15/1/21,taco bell s bold creamy chipotle sauce is perfectly described in its name this is a thick sauce with a strong smoky flavor and although it is quite spicy there is little heat i first used it to spice up black beans being served as a side dish for tacos the beans are so bland they always need something and this sauce was the perfect addition the sauce also worked beautifully with falafels again just the right amount of spice and it gave the pita bread sandwich stuffed with lettuce tomato cucumber and falafel balls a needed jolt finally i used the sauce on a veggie burger and it also worked beautifully there too i was pleased with the results each time i used it and found the sauce very versatile the only negative is it not low on calories two tablespoons have calories and of those are fat calories so i use it sparingly that said it is sufficiently spiced so that a little goes a long way 
positive,6/3/21,this is a wonderful product and i am not one who dines at taco bell i used to eat there when i was younger in college but have not in years so i was pleased to try this product and find that it was great first i like that the bottle is not so huge because the taste will stay fresh instead of getting stale from lack of use i have many dressings and toppings etc in my fridge so it is nice to have a smaller bottle second the taste is excellent i love the creamy texture and it has just a little heat from the chipolte flavoring to be interesting but not too hot i used this on a home made taco salad but i also used it as a sauce on a noodle dish i made that was like a south of the border spaghetti grandchildren like noodles so we made noodles and taco flavored meat and this sauce with a few veggies thrown in and had a mexican style noodle dinner that they loved so i highly recommend this product 
positive,8/6/21,this is a great sauce to use on sandwiches to give them a little extra kick love it with grilled chicken lettuce and tomato i would thin it a bit to use on a salad but it is just right with a sandwich could get creative with it meatloaf maybe 
negative,7/1/21,i ordered this product hoping it would really change my mind about using whey or soy i did not i have to mix it with my other protein just so i can drink it it taste like dirt and grass not s very good product 
positive,17/4/21,these noodles take just a couple of minutes to make and there is only one flavoring pack indomie noodles are absolutely fantastic and cheaper but take a little more effort to make i buy both brands and use as the mood strikes me the reason i am writing a review however is more about the price every asian store i have been to that sells this noodle pack charges around so it is definitely worth buying these at an asian store though not all asian stores sell sapporo i am hoping amazon will start selling the boxes of these for less than the asian stores sell single packets hint hint amazon just a note too indomie noodles are about half the price of these at least at the asian markets 
positive,10/3/21,easy to use because of the pre measured packets the smell and flavor are just like at the theater very good popcorn on the negative side there are two comments i only put half of the seasoning because it is way too salty too many unpopped kernels otherwise makes watching movies at home a lot of fun 
positive,14/1/21,everyone in our family liked these chips great taste and healthy compared to other chips if you like spicy food you will enjoy these 
negative,24/5/21,i typically go for breakfast blends but this coffee simply tastes bad i would recommend trying some variety packs rather than buying one big pack as i did 
positive,14/10/21,this brand has always amazed people with their coffee flavors and the vermont country blend is just one of them my husband and i tried it for the time and we loved it 
positive,7/2/21,i love this raw cacao this is a really good value this is so much more expensive in whole foods i make a banana ice cream pudding with it that tastes amazing frozen bananas pureed with teaspoons of raw cacao and a pinch of salt i place it in the freezer for a bit to set simple healthy and toddler approved 
positive,29/3/21,mat eacute is an awesome drink and rosamonte makes an affordable and good tasting product i would recommend this product to my friends and family 
positive,17/4/21,never just made the orange by its self miked it with the cream soda made by the same company people were begging me for the recipy i never follow the instructions i have tasted this brand of soda prepared very poorly not by me though tip pound of sugar per gallon no more no less that is the master rule 
positive,10/3/21,i actually liked the taste of this drink i would drink it without the energy factor the taste alone is the reason i give this product four stars there are two servings in one can i only drank one serving at a time i could not detect any extra energy or alertness i am a coffee drinker though it does have caffeine in it but not an excessive amount probably just the right amount so it does not give one the jitters i liked it 
positive,10/7/21,this tastes great i cannot say too much about the energy factor although i should point out that energy drinks do not usually do much for me it has a very nice mango flavor and does not taste like weird chemicals try it 
positive,27/1/21,this product has a very good taste not like many of the other energy drinks it tastes like berries and is smooth not tart at least to me i had four ounce glasses during the day i did not notice a huge spike in energy but i did not need an afternoon nap either it did not make me jittery etc and i slept well at night i wish it came in a diet drink no calories i would recommend this for the taste 
positive,1/6/21,i enjoyed the taste of no fear but i cannot say that it gave me any more energy than the other energy drinks on the market today since i do occasionally indulge in a few energy drinks from time to time i can say it delivered as much energy as other supplement brands the four stars were mainly for the taste 
positive,20/8/21,this brand of energy drink tastes good and really gives you a jolt of energy i did not have jitters afterwards and i noticed a difference in focus i have problems with some of them making me jittery but this one really worked with no side effects 
positive,14/8/21,we really enjoy de boles angel hair pasta it is not heavy and it is very tasty my kids are picky and this is the best product we have found to appease their request for quick and easy pasta 
positive,21/4/21,this is the best angel hair pasta as far as i am concerned the taste and texture are great 
positive,1/4/21,this couscous is absolutely wonderful the couscous is large pearl and is delicious served hot or cold cooks beautifully delicious plain with mushrooms mint or any one of a dozen other additions highly recommend it 
positive,17/4/21,i usually order this product from the actual gevalia site because this flavor is quite yummy i also order the cafe sperl which is also known as viennese coffee when you first open the bag the nose is tickled with the pungent smell of chocolate and a lighter aroma of raspberry the coffee tastes unique because of the raspberry flavoring but it is enjoyable either freshly brewed or chilled 
positive,10/3/21,i love this dressing it has such a good fruity flavor i have already recommended it to friends 
positive,22/4/21,i bought this for my hubby he loves dark rich coffee dark magic offers it great convenience of the kcup makes it that much nicer 
positive,25/4/21,i love ordering on line esp from amazon just as i am about to run out of coffee i get a email re special deals and i simply order and in a day the products are shipped this coffee is fantastic try it also donut shop is great
positive,1/4/21,i am grateful for my keurig coffee maker the taste of green mountain brand dark magic is terrific got used up real fast 
positive,30/6/21,first the nutrition facts serving size cup servings per container about calories fat sodium carbohydrates dietary fiber sugars other carbs protein this granola is really very tasty the chocolate chunks add a nice flavor and texture and the granola is very crunchy it comes in a plastic zip seal bag with so much chocolate and sugars this is by no means a health food but it is a great snack that at least has some nutrients unlike candy bars for instance and it tastes just as good if not better disclosure although i was not paid for this review i received one pouch of this product for free 
positive,1/3/21,i confess i do not eat this granola from a bowl with milk i keep it stored in an airtight container and use a shot glass to scoop out an ounce at a time for snacking very easy to toss back using the shot glass and my fingers stay clean it is very good and has no bad ingredients 
positive,29/1/21,this product is an alternative to eating granola bars the only downside is that portion control is easy with a granola bar whereas once you start eating this product out of the bag it is difficult not only to stop but also to gauge how much you have eaten unless you first scoop out what you want put it onto a plate and weigh it on a food scale which i doubt most people will do this is very tasty and is about the same calories as a granola bar for a similar portion while some of the pieces are chunks other pieces are single granola flakes or chips though this did not really bother me much as i like this since it is not superior in taste to the chocolate chip granola bars that i eat and since it is just too easy to eat a large portion for now i will stick with my granola bars but if portion control is not a concern then this is a great snack 
positive,17/4/21,i am by no means a granola connoisseur but this stuff is pretty darn tasty this product is made with all natural ingredients there honestly is not a lot of chocolate in it just the right amount it is dark chocolate but is not too bitter or too sweet overall it is just a very nice blend and tastes delicious maybe a little pricey but not a dealbreaker when considering it is made with real ingredients i would say for taste for value recommended 
positive,10/3/21,this granola is a mix of rolled oats and semi sweet chocolate chunks i could not find a description on the bag as to whether it is a snack or a cereal as a snack it is a bit dry for my taste and is not as sweet as the delicious quaker natural but i quite enjoyed it with milk its crunchy texture is just right and the chocolate is a treat if you like granola this is a good one a good source of fiber 
positive,30/5/21,i am typically a tea drinker after the first pot i made coffee every day until it was gone would definitely recommend 
positive,28/9/21,i am a cherry nut all the soda i drink has some sort of cherry flavour so i wanted to try this too great taste and how can i go wrong with vitamin c thrown in for good measure will be most popular with those that already drink heathy sodas such as airforce nutrisoda flex black cherry and apple ounce cans pack of 
positive,6/5/21,i tried another of these switch products and was less than pleased but maybe it was the flavor which i think was supposed to be watermelon the black cherry went down a lot easier although it is still a tad too acidic for me but it tastes good you know like black cherry brian w fairbanks
positive,20/4/21,i tried samu on a whim thinking that it would taste like many of the other coconut water drinks out there perhaps healthy but not terribly tasty to my surprise samu is fantastic it tastes fresh has the right amount of sugar and brings a subtle pleasantness along with it the design is pretty cool and my purchase supported an independent label i highly recommend this product and am sure that i will continue to purchase it 
positive,20/4/21,this is a great quality olive oil with a slightly grassy overtone to the flavor it is obviously a bit more expensive than your average everyday supermarket olive oil but it is well worth the money 
positive,21/4/21,these are really good tasting lentils the first thing i notice was the lack of that shinny coating you see on store bought lentils when you open the big you can tell right away there is something different about these they cook easily and hold their shape and taste great 
positive,2/5/21,excellent snack that is healthy and nutricious my son loves it it is a tad pricier than other brands but it tastes better 
positive,25/5/21,this french roast is by far my favorite i like a strong tasting coffee i also like the new packaging but i am glad that i did not buy a keurig k cup holder the way this coffee is packaged you will have to put it in a covered container this type of k cup recycles better too 
positive,7/9/21,this product exceeded expectation makes you feel better after drinking will buy again thank you dr oz for talking about it on your show 
positive,25/5/21,coffee preference is just a matter of taste so my opinion regarding taste probably does not mean much you would have to try this coffee for yourself what i can tell you is that these soft bottom cups are certainly different from the usual all plastic k cups i was initially concerned about how well they would work in my keurig but after making about fifty or more brews they work perfectly no loose grinds left behind in the pod well my mug or anywhere else they cost a little less than k cups so that is a nice plus for me the minor drawback is that they come to you in plastic bags that once opened allow exposure of the pods to air simple fix i just put the remaining pods in a ziplock bag i like the taste of this french roast coffee and the fact that it is also cheaper than the competition hopefully when the patent on k cups expires this september we will see more vendors offering better prices this is probably why keurig recently came out with a new brewer the vue that uses different and patented cups 
positive,22/5/21,i received my package today fog chaser and was the first cup really good full body and full taste just like it came ground fresh and no i do not know or work for the company just thought you would like an honest review from someone that buys boxes of k cup coffee a month i noticed no sediment in my cup and yes they cut the corner by leaving off the pastic cup to avoid the copyright that says they would then owe kuerig a percentage which drives up the price of all coffe in k cups it is not a k cup but will fit a k cup maker and that is what they advertise i can live with putting the filter cups in a baggie i do not need to show off my coffee in a carousel so this is just great to get a subscription discount for this good of a coffee that will fit my k cup brewer 
positive,19/7/21,was buying the kona blend until it dried up and then the price went through the roof tried several different k cup coffees until i found the fog chaser now i have it on my subscribe and save list i have it sent to my office my home my son s home every month it are not kona but it is almost as bold the aroma fills the kitchen in the morning and that first sip is great every time and at the price of the kona it is the best bang for the buck i will never go back 
positive,7/9/21,as many other reviews have mentioned these are not the normal k cups but they work much the same i generally drink the stronger k cups emeril s jet fuel kona etc and i find that these fog chaser pods compare very favorably there is no bitter aftertaste just smooth flavor i have not had any sediment at the bottom of my cup i have had sediment from other k cups i think people are a bit thrown by the smell of the coffee bag when they get it as it is a much stronger smell than you will get from a box of k cups it does smell like when you open a fresh bag can of ground coffee which is sort of refreshing after using k cups for years we have just finished the first bag of days which we kept in a ziplock bag and the last cup tasted as good as the first i already placed a subscribe and save order for the french roast to try out i will be keeping my subscription for the fog chaser as it is quite good 
positive,25/8/21,this product makes a great cup of cofee bold but not bitter no bad after taste the smell starts the experience and the satisfied full flavor follows i will buy this product as long as it is available 
positive,6/9/21, pink edible pearls are a wonderful addition to cakes cookies they can instantly add sophistication to any piece 
positive,25/5/21,i just have to say that i agree with the first reviewer i really had a good experience with this product i was buying it for a friend it came very quickly the product is unique and it is something that everyone can use the customer service was outstanding 
positive,7/9/21,great tasting kids love them and i do not have to worry that there are any genetically engineered ingredients a little pricey if you do not care if they are organic 
positive,13/10/21,out of all their different kinds of cookies this is the one that rocks you would never know this was gluten free 
positive,2/10/21,i got this as a small gift for my girlfriend who was always forgetting to buy more cheap popcorn at the store i thought she would enjoy some unique and gourmet popcorn and i was right she really liked them especially the purple kind we cook it on the stove with oil and it worked perfectly however do not be an idiot like me and splash oil all over your face does not feel good popcorn has a great distinct flavor and i think we will be returning for more 
positive,23/9/21,this product is pretty delicious i love using stevia instead of other fake sugars because it is a natural product and seems less likely to because cancer i wish more things would use it instead 
positive,26/6/21,if you love the flavor of toasted pecans this coffee is for you great flavor good coffee taste it was very easy to brew the right strength what a pleasure to wake up to the smell of toasted pecans and freshly brewed coffee this is the second time i have purchased this coffee and i will definitely do it again 
positive,25/5/21,i received a small box of these ginger and honey crystals and i fell in love with them what a great way to bump up your cup of hot tea they are strong and i would recommend starting with a small portion i ordered two bags of thirty packs and now my daughter in law wants a pack love it 
positive,7/9/21,we can get these crackers locally but the price is a lot higher i absolutely love these crackers and they have a deep rich cheese flavor i will continue to purchase these crackers from amazon to complement any holiday 
positive,15/7/21,i am thrilled with this extract i ordered it on a tuesday night and had it by friday afternoon it came wrapped nicely in plenty of bubble wrap and tissue paper and was accompanied by a nice little note from the seller thanking me for my order it smells wonderful it smells just like cocoa powder and i use it in all my baked goods and even savory foods added to gravy it gives it that little something extra and it is phenomenal in whipped cream cookies brownies sweetbreads cakes even coffee and hot chocolate it is not a sweet extract so it gives some depth to foods without adding additiona sugar i will definitely be ordering this in the future and definitely ordering from this merchant again i am very impressed with the quality and the customer service provided 
positive,3/6/21,very flavorful and gives amazing taste to salads and food in general just a pinch make a huge difference in the way your food tastes like this is the only type of salt i am using since i discovered it i put it on meat fish veggies salads soups etc everything tastes better with this salt i wish they would offer it in bigger sizes i usually order at a time so they last for a while since the size is small you will not be sorry for ordering this salt 
positive,27/9/21,we love these little figs they are a great snack and a pop in your mouth size will definately buy them again 
positive,19/6/21,i got this for my kids easter basket just to have something different and they loved it it tastes great and even travels well this is a great treat to take in the car or stick in a purse for that time when you are craving ice cream but cannot have it 
positive,25/5/21,true the flavor does not last for a long time but it tastes great and lasts long enough 
negative,7/9/21,first let me say i am a huge fan of endangered species chocolate this is my first time however trying this particular mixture i love orange and chocolate as a combination but this one definitely falls short unfortunately from what i can gather and the type of bitterness it is i am guessing they add too much of the pith while creating the orange oil it has a smooth delightful start but the more you eat the more pronounced the bitter taste becomes i am disappointed by the purchase and will not order this type again 
positive,3/8/21,i use this treat as a reward for getting on the grooming table my three dogs line up when i pick up the grooming brush what a treat 
positive,5/9/21,very good tastes like original jack links only with a little more flavor very tender and not dry but a little on the salty side the bag is huge though and there is a tiny amount in the bag it is disappointing 
positive,25/5/21,after having been diagnosed with a thyroid nodule which later turned out to be cancer i thought i had better try to get more iodine in my and my family s diet after researching some i found that dulse is a great natural source of iodine i tried a package of this and found that it is pretty good the package came with a suggestion to stir fry it a few minutes in a hot skillet to make it like chips which i tried i and my family enjoyed it much better that way the quality of this dulse is great and the price seemed comparable with others i could find i ordered more of this and am using it as a regular supplement to our diet 
positive,7/9/21,this is a must have snack if you like lemonheads and almonds you cannot go wrong i found these in walgreens so i decided to give them a try i was hooked they are addicting i have been looking all over for the lemonhead almonds luckily amazon came to the rescue and i was able to purchase two bags you will not regret buying them yummy 
positive,11/9/21,my son loves this food combination and eats it without any complaints the ingredients are simple and the taste is straightforward no funky baby food smell like the normal food in jars often has i will buy again and again 
positive,13/7/21,the taste of this balsamic vingear is very good for the price vinegar comes in a spray bottle wonderful for salads cuts down on waste when you added to anything else vinegar comes in a six pack each bottle ounces price for six pack but some of the very best sells for over a ounce bottle i never tasted that quality but like i stated earlier delallo tastes deliteful its made in italy 
positive,22/7/21,being diabetic i always carry one of these little delicious no added sugar snacks in my purse in case i need a pick me up to prevent low blood sugar another thing in its favor is this snack is gluten free ordering from amazon is fast and they always seem to have the food products that i need 
positive,22/6/21,these cookies not only taste great but they are prepackaged so you can just throw them in a lunchbox when you have a child on a gluten free diet saving time on food prep is always appreciated they are definitely a favorite in my house we love them they are small in size but are the best tasting chocolate chip cookie so far that we have found gluten free 
positive,28/7/21,these chips make a wonderful snack they give you the crunch and saltiness that you need at times without a lot of calories they also contain protein to keep you from getting hungry again until meal time they came in a single serving size package which is nice when you are mindful of portion control i would order them again 
positive,13/10/21,these treats are great the dog is crazy about them they are small but he really likes them you can also use them to conceal small pills if you need to give your dog medicine 
positive,19/2/21,i ordered the hot mix by mistake because i did not read carefully enough it did not matter this mix is great and not burn your face off hot which i hate super easy and quick to make and very tasty highly recommended 
positive,14/12/20,these pistachios are a ton better than you can get at trader joe s high quality and great taste 
positive,14/12/20,these were the best and somehow fresher tasting that we have enjoyed yet a good buy 
positive,19/2/21,it tastes great i have only used it as a supplement and not in cooking also some people had given concerns over packaging but mine was completely fine 
positive,10/1/21,this curry paste has a geat taste we use it in soups stir fries vegetable dishes and anything you would like to add some extra zing to 
positive,26/3/21,if you like spicy then these are the snack crackers for you so hard to find anywhere else a really good price on here 
positive,24/3/21,amber our golden retriever ate this food right up she gave it stars and said it was delicious we noticed that the food is puffed up that is neither good or bad just an observation i suppose if you have limited storage space it would be an issue the food we normally give her is definitely more compact and less airy 
positive,24/2/21,i bought this vita coco pure coconut water for my husband he loves it he tryed all different kind of coconut drinks but there were with some preservatives and other junks there were not tasty at all this one taste great and is healthy 
positive,19/2/21,i love this stuff i could drink it all day long nice and smooth going down and extremely refreshing the amount you get for the price is just perfect i have caught flack because it is expensive but this is the best coconut water on the market 
positive,14/12/20,shipping was fast the taste is great and reminds me of drinking from a real chilled green coconut on the sidewalk in thailand 
negative,19/10/21,this is mostly dry croutons with very little flavor i need to try to find some way to salvage this mix as no one will eat it the way it is right now i was expecting something more like chex party mix but was greatly disappointed it should have much more flavor spice to be enjoyable as a snack mix as it is it has less flavor than a bag of salad croutons or plain pretzels 
positive,18/5/21,an other reviewer was right these are better then wheat thins and i bought those for a long time for the crunch i think it is the sea salt that makes them tastier 
positive,19/2/21,i have been trying to give up soda and i found that the sparkling ice spring water is a great substitute love the taste bob
positive,14/12/20,kraft homestyle mayonnaise is rich and creamy a very good quality mayonnaise i will certainly buy more of same previously i have bought mayonnaise that sits in the fridge for ages maybe for generations this mayonnaise will go fast because it taste so good i have used on tuna hard boiled eggs and salad i highly recommend 
positive,1/6/21,i always have a case or two of maruchan ramen in the pantry their shrimp flavor is especially good i always drain the soup off the noodles before i serve them i especially like it with some spinach sauteed with an onion and a head of garlic seriously try it it is remarkably flavorful and costs next to nothing or just the noodles with some chopped green onion to dress them up or with a little curry powder i have tried top ramen in the past but prefer maruchan 
positive,1/4/21,this is a very good product and comes very close to fresh from the kitchen but breaking the clumps adding the water to get the right consistency is not as easy as one would think 
positive,15/4/21,this is a very nice green tea i had to try it since i love anything mango the flavor is perfect whether its hot or iced or with some creamer it smells amazing as well just like a real mango i would like it if the packing was more eco friendly like celestial seasonings but its still pretty nice the packets are individually sealed and there are no staples on on the bag so you do not get any weird taste added to the tea 
positive,19/5/21,my kids love hamburger helper so i figured this would be a great new product to try since anything with velveta is good it was easy to make and only took a few minutes to complete the kids absolutely loved it and i thought it tasted great too my only complaint was that visually it was unappetizing it did not look like the picture on the box it was kind of a grayish brown color and actually worried me a bit before i tried it luckily my kids and i do not really care how it looks so we all enjoyed it but kraft would benefit by working on presentation 
positive,19/2/21,having a busy schedule i can appreciate an easy boxed meal to cook every now and then i would have to say i prefer this brand to hamburger helper because of the taste and the quality of the product instructions were easy to follow the food was tasty and it is a nice back up to have in the pantry when you do not feel like making a meal from scratch 
positive,14/12/20,my husband loves velveeta shells and cheese so we had to try these very quick and easy do not need anything but the meat but you may want to add a salad or some veggies for a round dinner 
positive,28/7/21,this is pretty tasty if you eat this sort of thing and i will admit it is a rare guilty pleasure for me as compared to the brand that is no doubt its main competitor i thought this one tasted better probably because of the already mixed almost cheese sauce that is included which also replaces the milk that is usually added it is pretty much a toss up in terms of nutrition given that we are not looking at a nutritional champ to begin with here as prepared this one has calories per serving the other this has calories from fat the other this one has mg of sodium the other one has the kraft velveeta cheesy skillet comes out slightly ahead overall with protein of g compared to the other s g and dietary fiber of g compared to less than a gram for the competitor these differences are probably attributable to the cheese sauce the sauce also pushes this one over the edge for total fat with g for this one and for the other after the ground beef is added the difference is of the recommended daily amount vs virtually none of it good fat in either one it is significant that although both brands claim zero transfat both also list partially hydrogenated oil as one of their ingredients meaning they certainly do contain transfat just less than the half gram per serving that would require full disclosure if you eat the whole package about cups so realistically with a dinner and a leftover lunch or two you easily might you could get whacked with as much as g of transfat not to mention the saturated fat in the ground beef you add to both at grams of sodium you probably need to skip another meal that day to avoid going over the recommended daily value for sodium too you might consider fasting that day if you plan to eat more than one serving but as i said it is a guilty pleasure by definition that is not the most nutritionally sound choice that can be made in any case all other things price availability being equal i will probably choose this one if i choose it again 
positive,29/6/21,i was skeptical to buy this because i have bought cheap coffee before i am always disappointed with its taste this tastes great and the environmental factor is just a bonus for me 
positive,15/10/21,i ordered this delicious kadayif dessert for my sister s birthday with her present that i also bought it at amazon took them to my parents house to celebrate at their house everyone at the party enjoyed this delicious kadayif i served it with some turkish coffee it was the best dessert i ever tried everyone said where did i buy it from i said amazon of course they have anything and everything you want to get quality exceptional prices very low my son told everybody that i live in amazon website because i am there looking at it everyday to catch those bargains thank you amazon as allways bringing us the international flavors to our homes 
positive,20/7/21,this was a very pleasant surprise i was a bit hesitant when i read through the ingredients sure it sounded healthy but would it taste good in a word outstanding good crunch flavor and just the right amount of salt great to see that there is snack foods available that are a lot better for you than the usual chips and nachos the only problem is that everyone likes them so they disappear quickly 
positive,12/10/21,i love tortilla chips just good old fashioned corn chips with salt on them i was curious as to how these fancy tortilla chips would fare before even tasting these chips the bag shows that the company is serious about freshness it is tough and a little slippery i almost could not open it by hand the chips are little hexagons about in diameter with the various seeds clearly visible in the chips while the corn flavor is dominant the various other elements of these chips really blend well to give them a unique flavor they are not overly salty indeed if i had any quibble it is that a little more salt would be appreciated these chips would be an excellent choice for finger foods for a higher end dinner party a date or just an evening when you want to treat yourself 
positive,19/2/21,i liked the flavor and texture of the tortillas they are not spicy but the taste is not bland because of the olives the chips are small and the serving size in the bag is just enough for a quick satisfying snack 
positive,14/12/20,these chip crackers were very tasty however people who have allergies or problems digesting corn like me need to beware if you just read the front of the packet it seems as if they are made without wheat or corn not true the main ingredient is corn 
positive,2/7/21,these chips are great tasting you have to try them if you like sweet potatoes 
positive,11/3/21,i am munching on these chips as i type trying to keep the salt off my fingers and from going on the keys i like the way they taste the flavors are mainly of stone ground corn but you can tell there are other ingredients as well there is a nice nutty aftertaste i like texture too just the right amount of crunch these chips are not overly salty either another plus nutrition wise these chips rank among the more healthy versions there are only calories in a one ounce serving a lot less than the normal i see on similar products and the amount of fat and sodium is a lot lower too it is got of fiber of an average daily requirement there are no trans fats cholesterol preservatives etc it seems that the foodshouldtastegood company made a sincere effort to produce as healthy a product as was possible given the ingredients and requirement to make something that tastes good one reviewer said the chips were too hard and tasted stale my own experience was that the chips tasted fresh and were crunchy but by no means any harder or crunchier than a regular tortilla chip the expiration date on the bag is in november with no preservatives it seems odd that the bag the other reviewer tried had an expiration date more than a year away my only hesitation would be the price currently these chips are not in stock on amazon and there is no pricing given so i would say you would have to evaluate whether or not you wanted to pay that much for chips even though they seem better for your health than other brands and they taste good as well 
positive,10/4/21,i just got home from a long trip and was faced with making dinner luckily the velveeta cheesy skillet dinner was sitting in my pantry i browned a pound of chicken breast strips and followed the directions it was a quick and easy dinner for the family and everyone enjoyed it the ingredients come in different packets the pasta orzo i think seasonings dehyrated broccoli and velveeta cheese sauce after browning the chicken just add the seasoning and pasta along with about cups of water and cover in about or minutes add the dehydrated broccoli and cook another minutes then remove from heat and add the cheese sauce my kids loved it and there was plenty for everyone i found it to be better tasting than chicken helper and easier to prepare my only complaint was the miniscule amount of broccoli it was more like a sprinkling of dried parsley than broccoli florets of course you can always add your own fresh or frozen broccoli or other veggies to make it healthier and heartier overall a good choice for a hectic night when you do not have much time to cook and a lot of hungry little mouths to feed 
positive,22/7/19,wanted apricots to try making gluten free granola while i would have preferred unsulphered apricots they are so nasty looking i did not think my family would eat them everyone loves these very good price too 
positive,2/2/20,i mix this seasoning with hunts bbq sauce and the mix taste great on chicken the only problem this product has is that if the enviroment you live is a bit humid the seasoning absorbs the humidity of the ambient and hardens 
positive,2/2/20,i have made these for friends both gluten intolerant and not and everybody loves these they do not taste like they are gluten free excellent job by nuffins to mix convenience with quality and health 
positive,31/8/19,great tasting rich flavor perfect for making a nice hot cup of mocha i bought this to test it against hershey s syrup for my mocha and there is an incredible distinct taste difference that is noticeable this is much richer and tastes more like chocolate and less sugary then hershey s syrup 
positive,22/7/19,gerber s peach cobbler tastes amazing just like real peach cobbler but without the added sugars and butter my husband and i tried it to see why our daughter liked it so much and we quickly figured out that it was the best tasting baby food we have purchased and at a great price 
positive,12/1/20,this soup is quick and tasty microwaves in no time let it sit a few minutes so the tofu and seaweed can mature to full blossom i purchased thinking it was a miso soup but it is not at least related to the miso soups i get at my local oriental restaurants 
positive,19/2/20,will definitely buy again i sent this to a deployed soldier who shared it with the other boys and they all love it great flavour 
positive,27/11/19,while these are expensive for the calories they are one of few foods that can actually be eaten before strenuous exercises such as biking i also like these at when i am rolling out of my sleeping bag to summit a mountain very tasty indeed 
positive,12/12/19,this is really yummy instant coffee i like the fine powdery texture however i am not convinced it is organic coffee as the amazon description states the can does not say anything regarding organic ingredients maybe since it is produced outside the us it is not labeled as such but i will not be re ordering due to that 
positive,26/9/20,these taste fantastic and amazon sells them for a less expensive price than my local health food store thank you amazon 
positive,22/7/19,these grapes are very tasty the right mixture of sweet and tart very light and so good i ate the whole bag in day i will purchase it again 
positive,2/2/20,coffee flavor is so personal i love the taste of this coffee i gave one to a friend at work and he thought it was much to strong he freely admits that he has no problem drinking the company supplied coffee that sits in the big metal coffee urn all day my other friend drinks this kona blend black and he loves it i am not a huge coffee snob i drink maxwell house french roast at home i look forward to having a good tasting cup of coffee at work and this really fits the bill i put sweetener and cream in my coffee so it is important to get coffee that has flavor can stand up to the added ingredients even with cream and sugar the flavor is bold and smooth 
positive,23/5/20,the chocorooms are so good and tasty with no cholesterol the kids love them and they are a perfect size for them to think they are getting a lot of sweets 
positive,22/11/20,these were pretty tasty they do not stick in your teeth like other fruit snacks which is a huge plus but even better they are all natural and good for you i will buy them again for sure soon when this box runs out 
positive,30/3/20,you can smell the spinach it seems fresh and tastes wonderful i fed it to my son when we were on the go during his babyfood stage and gave it to my preschooler as a snack now both often reach for these as a snack and i am happy to offer them something other than cheerios or graham crackers when we are on the go 
positive,8/7/20,my son loves these pouches it is a quick and easy way to get fruits and veggies into a picky eater he loves the flavor and will grab these from me and eat the entire pouch i love that it is organic and healthy the fruits overpower the veggies which helps in making the flavor more acceptable to younger children it is easy to grab on the way out of the door as a quick snack or as a complement to eating out i highly recommend 
positive,4/1/20,they used to carry a large jar of this at a local store but i never saw it again after a few years ago and was deeply saddened it is delicious with brie on a cracker though i found out i am allergic to dairy so no more for me but it can also be used as a glaze eaten on french bread toast or in spoonfuls from the jar i love this stuff i only wish it came in a big tub that would last you the rest of your life 
positive,30/1/21,this was the first time we have had tings a friend told us about them and since since they ended up being per bag we gave them a shot my daughter has a severe milk intolerance and i have a wheat allergy and it is rare to find something delicious that we can both have my daughter is years old and can now enjoy cheetos just like her friends and they taste wonderful i am so thankful for products like these that taste good help us feel normal and are affordable if i could give stars i would 
negative,2/11/20,the chips had an odd texture tasting nothing like a corn chip the seasoning was more of a salsa flavor than a cheese it was even difficult to give these away to people
positive,17/10/20,since i am vegetarian i do not use meat with this but rather a bunch of portobello mushrooms and a whole onion turns out fantastic and the leftovers are even better the next day could use a few more noodles in the box but i just buy egg noodles separately and add a few 
positive,22/7/19,i had these when in the phillippines and then when i came had to have some more even though this a large bag we go through these fast in about two weeks 
positive,2/2/20,much fresher than the usual sun maid i buy at store less sugar too so they taste at a much higher quality i will continue to buy these in bulk to save hopefully the seller is reading my interview and sends me a code for discount since i gave a generous review
positive,4/10/20,it is somewhat hard to find a macadamia syrup but i happen to love this particular flavor my first order off amazon of a different brand broke and was then discontinued so i gave this one a try and i am happy i did it is quite tasty and comes with a pump which is a nice touch there are quite a few servings in each bottle and it is perfect for italian soda also from a practical standpoint they are using plastic bottles for the shipped product which makes it much less likely to break in transit 
positive,1/4/20,this is absolutely delicious my husband has had it on vanilla ice cream every night since it arrived just the right blend of chocolate and raspberry 
positive,8/5/20,i love blueberry coffee and this was very good but if you purchase do not get whole bean get it ground before they send it the oils in the flavoring make it tough on some grinders 
positive,18/6/20,i bought this product from vitacost i really enjoyed the fresh healthy flavor i decided to purchse from amazon because it is in bulk thereore cheaper it sso worht it i have tried a lot this mix really impressed me no chocolate to melt in the car 
positive,20/8/20,my husband and i love this ketchup to me the taste is better than the regular heinz ketchup the color and texture are exactly the same but the flavor is better you cannot beat organic 
positive,1/6/21,the spice and flavor go hand in hand so i usually add all of the flavor packet i make these slightly soupy and i often discard a little of the broth to reduce sodium levels spare my digestive tract from the ravages of my taste buds also great and more of a meal with egg stirred in near the end i could eat these every day but alas that would have dire consequences taking the nutritional drawbacks as a given these are for price flavor 
positive,4/7/21,if you like spicy noodles and do not really feel like taking time to make it this comes really close instant noodle at its best just boil some water toss the noodles in add some vegie kamaboko tofu whatever you like and have that will actually look like a fancy bowl of noodles when you are done in less than mins 
positive,5/2/20,they are not for the faint of heart i get so bored with most foods that claim to be spicy hot but shin ramyun delivers and it is not just hot it is got great taste i have been buying them by the pack for years and loving every bite 
positive,22/7/19,this ramen is so good i also bought the neoguri also a good choice if you like seafood i would highly recommend this it microwaves well i use pyrex i am deployed on a ship and it was sent out here pretty quick relatively speaking ok lol and none of the ramen was damaged during vertrep it is spicy definitely seriously spicy i cook it with minimal water so it stays that way i love it will buy again it is pretty much the highlight of my day 
positive,2/2/20,i enjoy these noodles over most other noodles it is spicy enough to make my nose run which i like and the noodles have a nice texture to them 
positive,22/11/20,this is a knockout bold coffee it is great cup at the setting with tons of flavor have not tried it yet at the setting but assume it will still pack a flavor punch great deal in the pack 
positive,1/3/20,if you like bold taste then add it to your cart because you will love this coffee this is one of my variety that i choose on a morning i need a jump start or a lecture from my mom ha
negative,23/11/20,just when i got my shipment i tried it out on my pit but he only ate portion of it and he never ate it after that so i also tried it on my rottweiler and she does not like it also the only way they would eat it is if i add some caned meat with it then they would but that should not be the case so i do not recommend 
positive,5/4/21,rarely can i say that a gf product tastes better than the gluten version thse cookies do though melt in your mouth delicious and just the right amount of lemon i am confident tht if you gave these to gluten eaters they would not be able to tell the difference 
positive,27/4/20,these little cookies taste fantastic not too sweet just right chocolate melts easily so we will be ordering these in the cooler months only
positive,8/3/21,this product is very tasty but if you are also lactose intolerant better forgo the pleasure milk is not listed on the allergy advisory may contain traces of but the ingredients section lists whole milk powder as a component of the chocolate coating otherwise it is a great product 
positive,30/1/20,this was beyond my expectations the variety was a great blend of different soups and so easy to fix even my husband liked them i quickly ordered another set because it was so good tasty and easy
negative,22/7/19,i love regular merengue cookies and i normally do not have a problem with sugar free but these cookies had a terrible taste and worse texture stick to the non sugar free 
positive,2/2/20,this tea has the real flavor of pumpkin it is nicely spiced and perfect for an autumn afternoon it is quite highly caffeinated so i do not drink it late at night but overall a lovely tea 
positive,2/9/20,this fondant was very smooth and easy to work with along with having a good taste you do not always get good taste in fondant 
positive,26/1/21,definitely a very good jerky not dry or chewy at all very tasty did not need any extra flavoring we went thru the packs pretty fast even though they were supposed to last a while 
positive,9/1/21,we use this popcorn in an air popper on the weekends it is delicious and tastes much better than anything we have been able to find in the stores 
positive,30/7/21,i was looking for a hulless popcorn due to my diverticulitis boy do i miss popcorn and tried this based on the reviews i was disappointed that this has way to many hulls for me the hulls do not disappear or get so small but the flavor of the popcorn is amazing very very tasty my family loves it so i will buy it again we air popped it sprayed it with a little cooking oil and sprinkled some popcorn flavored seasoning butter hardly any calories but lots of taste they are tiny when they pop so you really should not flood it with anything heavy or it will turn to mush 
positive,30/10/20,i bought this from my local health food store it has a wonderful coconut taste i use it in everything from my morning oatmeal to yogurt i put some in my dogs food and their coats have been so shiny and soft i also suffer from a dry flakey scalp so i massage a small amount into my hair and let it sit for minutes before i shampoo it out it leaves my hair so soft and shiny it is a great waterproof mascara remover too i will be buying this item in bulk i love all the benefits coconut oil has to offer 
positive,3/8/20,these almonds are the best i love the tasted but was not quite as zippy or strong as i had hoped i do eat lots of hot items so perhaps my taste buds are expecting more having said that the flavor and freshness is tops 
positive,29/1/21,this was my first time ordering from this company they are fast and a great product will def be ordering more flavorings in the future 
positive,24/10/21,this is a great olive oil great price i love colavita products in general delivery was fast shipping was a bit pricey 
positive,24/10/21,this is a really great product not sweet at all the name describes it perfectly however i am not sure why it is a case i would buy it in the store much cheaper
positive,16/10/21,this has a strong granny smith apple taste i eat apples all the time so if anyone says otherwise they are mistaken same texture just a different and better taste now i am purchasing three packs a week because it taste so good tasty enough to substitute an unhealthy dessert for this tasty treat 
positive,24/10/21,very good flavor and not filled with a bunch of chemicals although there are still questions about some of the ingredients it is a great alternative to what is on the shelf in the grocery store 
positive,25/9/21,a must for anyone who loves to cook this sauce along with the raspberry chipotle are so tasty and add a nice twist to spice up otherwise boring chicken and steak also makes a nice and cost effective gift 
positive,19/10/21,the coffee has a bold without bitterness taste it is very delicious i enjoy drinking grove square coffee dark roast every morning 
positive,20/10/21,i was not too sure about trying this product because the price seemed too good to be true gluten free products are usually so much more expensive what a pleasant surprise we really liked it we really liked it seriously this product is worth a try i used it for a base for lasagne and for a change from the regular spaghetti noodles delicious 
positive,19/10/21,i just found and with chocolate and i am thrilled i love sugary goodies but i am not a fan of calories and i do not like chocolate i thought i would try with chocolate anyway and i am so glad i did eating a serving or two of with chocolate satisfies my sweet craving without breaking my calorie bank sometimes when i want to splurge i spread some with chocolate on a graham cracker spread some marshmallow fluff on another and sandwich them together yum 
positive,15/6/21,the chocolate is just as amazing as the regular plus a healthy indulgence i love to use it as a dip for animal crackers also great on apple wedges 
positive,4/8/21,this product tastes great i use it in my protien shakes to help mask the tastes of some of the flavors i have tried and do not like with the i now like the taste of the shakes and use this every day i prefer the with coco powder but both products taste great

positive,18/7/21,i used to purchase these at my local wal mart but they do not carry them anymore and when i looked at other stores they were soooo expensive i decided to check online and was able to order them at a reasonable price and received them pretty quick now i am a happy and content customer
positive,18/10/21,i sent this collection of italian cheeses to my daughter and needless to say she was delighted they were excellent formaggio del cucina italian cooking cheeses pound by igourmet com 
negative,15/6/21,this blend is bitter and does taste earthly like drinking mud really it is the wake up blend is much better
positive,4/8/21,this is one of my favorite kinds of coffee for my keurig it has a nice dark taste that is not overpowering while still being strong my mother hates strong coffee and when she comes to my house she will resuse one of these k cups after i have made mine to knock the punch out whatever your pleasure i guess 
positive,8/6/21,for those of you who drink coffee black i think you are going to love this blend of coffee it is very delicious and has a great bold flavor 
positive,15/6/21,i love tazo teas i do not really like friuty ones but this one is okay it is tart so i have to over sweeten it its not one ove my favs
positive,4/8/21,i like this and will order again just a little spice and sweetness the corn flakes are actually fried so they remind me of a thin corn chip rather than breakfast cereal 
positive,25/9/21,the whole family even those who are not gf loves the flavor of this mac cheese tastes like the kraft velveeta cheese shells we made the recipe on the box which was yummy 
positive,19/10/21,i love popcorn we have popcorn about nights a week i started out looking for popcorn on the cob as i had that this year and it was lovely and then stumbled upon india tree it is the closest that i can find to the dried on the cob popcorn and i love it it is so fresh and natural tasting i have been using it for several months and ran out the other day and had to use a popular store brand though the kernals popped up larger the taste was stale and processed not to mention the india tree popcorn is actually cheaper than the store brand i am placing my order for more india tree right now 
positive,4/9/21,although a little crumbly these are very tasty for a rice cake i would definately get them again simple taste but sweet enough to stave off an after lunch craving 
positive,31/8/21,this rice is delicious vegetarian and easy to make i usually add some extra vegetables to it but other than that it is perfect just as it is calories cup servings per pouch total fat no saturated or trans fat cholesterol sodium potassium total carbs fiber sugar protein 
positive,9/10/21,very fresh tasting and refreshing better than any other brand i have tried a good buy if you get it delivered on a regular basis short reviews not wanted by amazon 
positive,15/6/21,after trying many different brands and being totally disappointed i reluctantly tried taste nirvana it tasted great refreshing not too sweet and mildly nutty coconut flavor signed up for monthly delivery that says it all 
negative,4/8/21,if you like vanilla you will love this i am not a big fan of vanilla and this literally tastes like i am eating the melted vanilla ice cream out of a bowl much too sweet for me 
positive,15/6/21,my husband loves these they are easy to make and yield consistent results easy to customize the strength by just using more or less water we bring a few packets when we go away on weekend trips buying in bulk here is definitely cheaper than buying at the store cheers 
positive,4/8/21,as we sample many flavors of k cups from amazon com a few stand out and timothy s world coffee italian blend stood out it has a fantastic flavor rich and delicious i recommended it to one of my co workers and they enjoyed it as well this will be one of my stock items from now on 
positive,15/6/21,i will admit on the advice of my trainer i was not excited about adding protein shakes to my daily regiment i was pleasingly surprised by the taste though it is difficult to get the powder to dissolve in water but mixing it with soy milk and shaking it up did well for me it also fills me up for a time between meals while providing me the protein i was lacking 
positive,4/8/21,i am glad i bought these before the price rose from to they are good but not worthy of such a large price hike if the cost returns to a reasonable value i will consider buying them again 
positive,1/10/21,took a chance on this peanut butter because it was a great price turns out it is also great tasting too and i used it to make cookies loved the smoothe texture no separation and definitely lots of peanuts 
positive,1/7/18,i purchased this to use on my hair and it has done wonders for my hair i purchased other brands after i purchased this brand and by far it is the best i also eat a teaspoon of this everyday and it taste so yummy if you are looking for coconut oil that tastes great and works wonders for your hair all at a good price then this is the one for you you will not be disappointed i just received my second order of vitacost coconut oil i love this stuff i now use it for stir frying veggies frying up burgers i even fried chicken with this oil and it came out great this brand by far beats all the other brands on the market in value and taste and if you suffer from dry skin especially during the cold winter months just whip this with some shea butter and apply to your skin your skin will thank you for it
positive,10/8/18,it is great for making popcorn in my stir crazy popper we bought it because it is suppose to be really good for you i will let you know in years if it made me live longer 
positive,1/7/18,i bought this green tea because it is organic i knew i was getting a healthy product but what i got was much more the taste is really good it is fresh smooth and full bodied you will be pleased with this high quality tea what a nice surprise note this bigelow product comes bags to a box and tea bags to a wrapper 
positive,10/8/18,this tastes great i love it in my coffee and have even used it for pancakes it really does not give me a spike in blood sugar as promised the only negative is the packaging they are using during shipping some of the seals underneath the lids came off and the bottles leaked i probably lost about a tablespoon each from of the bottles the lids do not really fit the bottles either they have a pop top but if you use it the syrup sometimes leakes out from under the lid where it attaches to the bottle if they could fix the bottles this would definitely be a five star product update the product was not available for a few months and when it came back new packaging my last shipment was sealed up tight five stars for sure but amazon will not let me change that part 
positive,13/9/18,i think this is a great tasting product use in coffee every day i am saying goo bye to white sugar 
positive,17/7/18,i have been using this for a year now very good in tea i use it on anything my son puts it on his cereal he is a very picky eater and he has no clue it is not real sugar i put it on my pancakes yuuuuummyyyy

positive,1/7/18,we have purchased this on amazon and had it shipped to our son s dorm room in college a great way to send snacks spend over and shipping is free 
positive,10/8/18,i found this once in a store but they do not carry it any more i am so thankful that amazon com carrys it my son says it is his favorite meal 
positive,15/2/20,i order this for my office and everyone loves it i think its a great low cal alternative to chips and such 
positive,22/4/21,more of a cross between a cracker and a cookie i love these they have a very distinct flavor that both my wife and i enjoy as well as the kids trust me to find a snack that everyone likes in our family is no small task but we are very happy with the newtons fruit thins fig and honey and look forward to trying other flavors 
positive,25/9/20,these fruit thins are very tasty they are loaded with figs which are loaded with vitamin b they are also not nausiatingly over sweetened which is great for us diabetics i really liked these cookies and plan to buy them again 
positive,16/11/19,this newton product is a good adaptation of a cracker the fruit is in the product but it is thin and chewy my year old enjoyed it also i would highly recommend it for adults youth and children the idea of making this type of change shows creativity and ingenuity with such a wonderful brand 
positive,9/9/20,these treats were surprisingly tasty and filling calories per serving cookies but the cookies were really the perfect size for a light snack these had more of a gingerbread taste than a honey taste but that is not a bad thing allergy alert contains soy product 
positive,1/7/18,at first i thought i would not like these i like fig newtons but i do not love them however i could not be more pleased first of all my first bite tasted like an oatmeal cookie i immediately checked the ingredients and yep there is oats in there absolutely delicious there are bits and pieces of fig scattered throughout the cookie or thin but it is not like a spread now i am not sure if it is supposed to be spread between thins but its like spots of fig here and there and the fig is kind of hard and chewy but fortunately or unfortunatley there is very little fig so it is not that big of a deal i could not taste the honey but that is ok i absolutely love oatmeal cookies and it tasted like that they are a nice size and crisp i dunked them in my tea and they were delicious my hubby hates fig and i slipped these in his lunch and he loved them too he did not even taste the fig these are very good however if you really really want to taste fig get the regular fig newtons 
positive,10/8/18,these are good but i think i was spoiled by the blueberry flavor they are my favorite i like the whole line because they use better quality ingredients these are delicious but i would like more figs 
positive,15/1/20,i have been a david seeds fan since i was a kid i did not think anyone could beat their seeds since trying bigs seeds buffalo wing i now have a new favorite the seeds are a little spicy but you can eat a whole bag wihout it leaving your tongue raw i have tried all the flavors but buffalo wing is my favorite try them you will be surprised i am not a young kid i have years of sunflower seed eating experience 
positive,1/9/20,would have given it five stars but the product needs to be inch away from perfection for that to happen all in all it does what i needed it to do and in spectacular fashion 
positive,22/7/21,of the plum tots pouches i have had this is by far the best tasting these are a little pricey but when they are on sale they are worth every penny great for throwing in a diaper bag or purse 
positive,1/7/18,i discovered these when my daughter was about months old i wish i had found them earlier they are organic taste great are easy for toddlers to handle and very convenient i always keep some in my purse and in the car when we are out and about they are not messy unless of course they decide to squeeze the pouch which only happens for us when she is not hungry the plum organics line also includes some varieties with fruits and vegetables mixed together they taste surprisingly good and are one way to get my picky eater to eat some veggies you can find some varieties at reasonable prices on amazon others are more expensive for some reason babies r us has had a sale every other month or so where you can get them for each if you buy them in sets of that is usually when i stock up for the next two months 
positive,10/8/18,i am a very satisfied customer in which will purchase again i could not receive them fast enough thank you 
positive,14/5/21,i am pretty happy with this product it has a good taste the peanut is clear and not burnt and like the low sodium in it i do not miss sugar in it pulling all that other stuff out brings the peanut flavor forward my one negative is that it is not as silky as i would like maybe just a tad too low on oil 
positive,17/10/19,bars tasted good were fresh and i am pooping better i would recommend this product to anyone and they are cheap 
positive,3/10/21,i do not know why other people are complaining about the taste i mixed it with almond milk and really liked it maybe the flavors go well together in any case it tastes a lot like every other protein powder i have tried except without the disgusting synthetic sweetness 
positive,15/9/20,these snacks are so fresh and tasty i have never had any snacks that are fresher than these after trying the first bag of mareblue snacks they became our favorites for everyone in the family they are not very sweet but just right for our taste thank goodness for mareblue now we have a great snack that is healthy and tasty

positive,1/7/18,this product tastes just like peanut butter so a great alternative for those with a peanut allergy or for children who attend peanut free schools my granddaughter could not taste the difference we all use this product now and love it 
positive,10/8/18,i have a home daycare and have a child allergic to nuts i ordered this because we could not fool the kids with our local alternative sunbutter i had two toddlers that would go without before they would eat sunbutter because they could tell it was not peanut butter i ordered this without putting much hope into it as i have tried several and could never trick the pickiest kiddos i was pleasantly suprized when i served this and not a one kid could tell it was not the real thing i am glad i ordered such a large quantity i will be using this from now one it is by far the best alternative out there a huge bonus is the fact that there are not a bunch of additives anything that uses cane sugar and sea salt always sit better with me anyway great product 
positive,5/12/19,good stuff if you are allergic to peanut butter tastes the same to me but i am not that picky although it did give me the same heartburn as peanut butter so i stopped using it it may be that i cannot digest high fat foods of this type not the product itself 
positive,21/10/19,very good maple syrup i use it daily in place of sugar the no drip spout is very nice 
positive,8/9/20,thank you king arthur for this wonderful mix i enjoy baking however after being diagnosed with celiac disease last year it kind of took the fun out of baking for me but with this mix the baker is back these cookies are exceptional my gluten consuming friends could not tell the difference cannot wait to try the other products please keep developing more new gluten free mixes 
positive,22/9/21,this cereal packs a flavorful punch the blueberry oat clusters are divine i only wish it had less sugar but even then its not at all overly sweet 
positive,2/10/20,this is what you need to make your gumbo taste the way it should it is difficult to find in stores and i was happy to be able to get it from amazon 
positive,25/7/20,this is the best salad dressing i have ever had it really does taste like bruschetta and since it is oil based instead of cream it is way healthier five stars 
positive,4/7/21,seems to get rid of stomach acid coming up my throat forgot what that is called may just be the placebo effect i put a tea bag in a oz container with reverse osmosis water before i go to bed i then drink it in the morning with my breakfast 
positive,11/9/21,i love this tea it has flavor and zaz you should try it 
positive,4/7/21,i grew up on this juice in england the lemon flavor was the original look for the orange and black currant mmmmmm it is great in the usa you do not tend to find what we call cordials so much it is a economical way of getting a great tasting juice it is so concentrated it goes a long way i have a soda stream again something i grew up with in the uk and i make a lot of club soda with it i then add a small amount of barley water and it is so refreshing i love it 
positive,21/9/21,i was never a pop tart fan but on a lark and due to the coupon i tried these i was pleasantly surprised at how good they tasted i would prefer more filling as you can barely taste it the frosting is very light and adds a perfect sweetness one package w coffee is a perfect quick breakfast since amz is now out of stock for this flavor i ordered the apple frosted ones i think the unfrosted might be too flavorless for me 
positive,11/9/21,i have always been pretty picky about my poptarts so i was not sure if these were going to taste like cardboard or not when i first got them they are great poptarts my kids love them 
positive,12/10/21,we love pop tarts the name brand ones but wanted to get away from all the chemicals food dyes and especially hfcs that those are loaded with these are a great substitute 
positive,11/10/21,having to ditch pop tarts for their extensive list of ingredients including trans fat i first bought the strawberry ones of this brand i loved them and bought and entire case here then i decided to try blueberry both are great but i liked strawberry better the only bad thing is that they have a lot of sugar each 
positive,28/9/21,i love to have soup for lunch and as a result i like to have a variety of soups available this soup is very good 
positive,19/10/21,when i was first introduced to this product and business opportunity i was a little skeptical about it but after i started drinking it i really like it i experienced good things i did not get any coffee jitters and crashes plus i lost some weight like most people experience so i decided to sign up as a representive so i can get it the products at wholesale then as time goes i check my website and there were alot of people as my downline then i relized that this business is really growing whether i do anything or not so i decided to purchase the bronze promotional package and i started getting on this business my upline and leaders are a great help and i am pretty much just trying to duplicate their success and its working i have just upgraded to the silver promotional package to really get my business growing i have made all my investment money back and some in the short time that i have been involved in og considering that i do not do much i just give people samples and show them the business opportunity if you like to know more about this business give me a email at zang xiong hotmail com i am more then happy to share this opportunity with anyone that is interested and looking to change their lifes 
positive,4/7/21,i purchased this lime juice a few years ago on a trip to florida goes great with everything especially in a bloody mary 
positive,11/9/21,seriously i did not taste it but my dogs love these shipping was very fast i received them within or days of ordering good price 
positive,12/9/21,this is excellent coffee a bit strong which i personally like price is good enough for this quality 
positive,13/7/21,this is a great snack easy to prepare in the microwave just make sure you bring it to a boil or it has a slimey texture tastes way better than instant in our opinion 
positive,23/10/21,wanted my daughter to keep organic as much and long as possible so we tried this brand first this veggie when she started solids it smells and looks bright and from the first spoonfull it is not so runny it will not stay on a spatula style spoon she loved it this is a veggie she does not refuse she will eat a jar of this even after a full bottle if i let her no side effects noticed and i even tasted it found it barely sweet and wholesome this is a great deal and cheaper than in store arrives bubblewrapped to death and no weird or broken jars so far 
positive,22/9/21,it tastes pretty good i mix it in a single serve blender with water chia seeds that is been soaking in the water for min a banana an apple and sometimes frozen mixed berries do not mix it with coconut water i tried that and it tasted horrible i bought this at first at whole foods but amazon is much cheaper especially with the subscription program 
positive,4/7/21,i love this green mix i mix it with almond milk half a frozen banana and a whole pack of frozen acai and use it as a meal replacement love it 
positive,11/9/21,i honestly was scared of ordering this as some of the reviews are less than positive about the taste but seriously it is good if you are already a vegetarian or if veggies are a primary part of your daily diet you will have no problem with the taste it is like eating sweet fresh grass it is gritty but it does not bother me at all 
positive,8/8/21,grove square cappuccino cups were excellent tasted really good right from the keurig brewer with nothing added wwould highly recommend rccjr
positive,9/7/21,i also bought this product and i can tell you that i received my shipment in a timely manner and it was worth it this cappuccino tastes delicious with no additions like milk cream or sugar just brew it by itself and enjoy the perfect combination of a great cappuccino absolutely worth the price and i saved a ton of by not purchasing from starbuck s 
positive,24/10/21,this product is hard to find for us in stores in ohio most k cups are french vanilla coffee not cappuccino its delicious will buy again for sure 
positive,4/7/21,wow these k cups are so yummy and perfect if you are on the go they do not require cream and sweetener so just brew and go the only thing i would like better is if they were sugar free using a sugar substitute and were lower fat or fat free they do taste yummy though and for the price you can go wrong 
positive,11/9/21,looking for great coffee at a great price this is it k cups are expensive but this coffee is great tasting at a great price when purchased from amazon
positive,24/10/21,this may not be real cappuccino but i am not sure i know what that is this tastes good and i really enjoy a cup of it especially on these chilly mornings 
positive,22/6/21,no complaints coffee tasted good and it comes out to less that a cup i personally think it is a bargain 
positive,30/7/21,i absolutely love this cappuccino i had my doubts but they were proved wrong i myself have a sweet tooth and i was worried that this product would taste too much like coffee and not enough like a cappuccino but thankfully i was worng and it had the right blend of both i had cups the first day i bought it shared it with my family they loved it too 
negative,10/7/21,very disappointed in the taste nothing like it is described tastes very watery with some sugar added to it bummed i wasted my 
positive,4/7/21,yummy great tasting and very convenient only drawback is you must clean your machine at least once a week to keep it from clogging just like with hot chocolate 
positive,11/9/21,these are the best seeds i have ever tasted full of flavor it is hard to stop eating them 
positive,20/9/21,i bought this mix at the local grocery store and was very happy with them quick easy and tasty my boys love them 
positive,13/10/21,this product is so easy to use make and is delicious reminds me of my trip to the holyland 
positive,2/8/21,when i opened the package i thought this tea smells exactly like italian pignoli macaroons but the taste is definitely darker and more bitter perhaps i let it steep too long or perhaps sweetener would bring out the cookie flavor more whatever black it tastes pretty similar to the republic of tea vanilla almond flavor which i also like this tea seems to have bigger leaf pieces and less fannings than typical for bagged teas by the way so it is probably a higher grade of tea underneath the flavorings 
positive,11/6/21,this product is a great substitute for sugar in drinks it does not have a funny aftertaste or change the taste of the drinks i put it in obviously it is a good alternative for sugar but another reason i purchased it was because of it is benefit on teeth xylitol is used in other countries i have read to fight tooth decay and improve oral health in adults and children alike you must used grams daily for this benefit my husband and i both use the toothpaste also excellent and gum last week i saw a dentist on primetime tv doing a show on oral health and he strongly recommended xylitol for children also 
positive,2/8/21,i recently gave up coffee made the switch to teas i have tried all the usual suspects lipton other grocery blends were bitter or weak i purchased the loose tea leaves from amazon at a fair price quick shipping english friends suggested pj tips tea which we ordered from another online site twinning s blows it away the earl grey irish blend are great both on the pallet to the nose 
positive,18/10/21,delicious loose earl grey tea i use it for making iced tea my favorite check out the adagio ingenuitea brewer available here on amazon for a great tea making setup my only wish is that amazon stocked it in a bigger size i am running out of ideas for things to do with all the dozens of little metal tea boxes i have around the house now good for storing electronic cables screws poker chips etc loose tea is much better than bagged tea more room for the leaves to brew 
positive,23/7/21,this product is absolutely delightful they are better than chocolate to me and one taste and you are hooked 
positive,8/7/21,great tasting coffee hard to find decaf hazelnut coffee found this at amazon taste great at a reasonable price tried more expenive decaf hazelnut coffee and was disappointed with the taste did not even taste like hazelnut this is a full bodied hazelnut coffee
positive,11/6/21,i find these are a great alternative to the licorice laces we are all used to the taste and texture seemed very similar to me in fact i like them better because of the lack of the artificial aftertaste would definitely buy again 
positive,25/6/21,taste is great exactly what i needed for my cocktails i just wish there was a way to buy only one bottle 
positive,2/8/21,i bought this for my mother who tasted the tea in a restaurant this is now her favorite tea 
positive,11/6/21,was not expecting much from the product however it delivered a lot better taste than other products of this type that i have tried
positive,9/7/21,great taste greater tasting greats tastes greating tasteeses greate tastee greatr taster greatt tastet greaty tastey greati tastei greatm tastem
positive,22/6/21,used this last night and we had great tasting spaghetti packaging was good and it came in a reasonable time good job 
positive,2/8/21,my baby loves this stuff i do not like peas but i tried this once and it was not bad i add cereal to make it thicker my baby likes a paste like consistency always has otherwise it is more like a medium thick puree in consistency i would absolutely recommend this product 
positive,11/6/21,very tasty product and low fat and natural i have tried most of their flavors and like them all will buy again 
positive,8/7/21,this product though expensive along with the shipping is the best tasting non instant i have tasted add a little vanilla and sugar and it is very drinkable my grandkids call it magic milk the only complaint i have is that one package was received not fully sealed so i had fine powder all over 
positive,28/9/21,i purchased single packs from a supermarket i made them by using the provided method but i added eggs the soup base got way too thick for the other pack i did the same but added extra water it was much better 
positive,23/8/21,well first got this from grocery at a premium price ordered from amazon and saved some cash just as tasty and definitely worth it this product was one of the contributing factors that led to getting a prime membership 
positive,1/8/21,i have not been able to find this in any store lately i had some a few years ago and it is really good this is more like coffee cake than anything else the swirl is a cinnamon sugar with small pecan pieces and the bread is sort of like yellow cake i am excited to find it on amazon 
positive,16/7/21,i love the taste of this i used it to pop my corn in it made the popcorn all buttery i have to deduct a star because when it gets cool it leaves that film that crisco like shortenings do on the roof of your mouth i hate that and it has trans fats 
negative,2/8/21,i recently went on a gluten free diet where this hurts the most so far is breakfast there is barely any flavor to this cereal i picked up mine from whole foods not amazon i would rather it was fortified by vitamins and even though i am sure it would taste worse at least it would have taste and do me some good it really is not filling the barely darkened milk does not taste chocolate though does lose some of the good taste of the only thing with taste the milk i do not know if it is the rice flavor or the general lack of flavor but there is a hint of staleness i think could i add sugar sure and then i would taste the sugar or sugar substitute but that does not make it more healthy to be fair it is not bitter or too salty or too sweet or sour so there is not anything there to offend if you are eating it fast enough it will not be mush if it has stopped making noise you are in danger of mushiness it makes some truly good snap crackle and pop noises i suppose the cereal is bad enough to encourage you to eat some fresh fruit to have a good taste in your mouth and remember to take a daily vitamin i can only take those every other day it is cheaper than granola when i can afford it i am totally getting outrageous gluten free granola i also have envirokids to try next 
negative,11/6/21,i am a huge vita coco fan i drink it almost ever day this flavor terrible i cannot believe that vita coco sells it stay away
negative,26/6/21,i wish rihanna would get her face off this product it tastes nasty i bought a couple dozen since i love vita coco s products however this flavor is just the worst they tried and the taste has a hint of guava but it does not work in this package i have tried giving them away and nobody wants them i still have not seen anyone who likes the taste 
positive,20/8/21,i had never tried blackstrap molasses before and i was expecting not to like the taste after reading many online comments about how awful it tastes and how much it is an acquired taste i bought this from the grocery store since it was on sale and i actually love the taste of it i read on another site that some people thought it tastes like licorice but i do not think it does at all which is good because i hate the taste of licorice the only thing i do not like about this is that it is really messy maybe if it was in a squeeze bottle it would be easier to pour into a measuring spoon 
positive,25/8/21,read the ingredients on most cereal boxes then read the kashi boxes what a difference you may never eat a regular cereal again kashi cereals taste better eat better and make a true cereal lover happy 
negative,19/10/21,i love strong tasting tea and these has no taste i feel like i am just drinking hot water i would not recommend it 
positive,2/8/21,i think this is the best chicken rub ever very tasty and very easy to prepare we are huge fans of roasted chicken so i try different recipes with regularity but find i keep coming back to this one it is a favorite and has never let us down 
positive,11/6/21,bought these to try some new recipies but have found they are quite tasty straight out of the can chopped up in my salad 
positive,22/10/21,i am not a beef stick beef jerky eater these were bought for my son s school snack however i have eaten a few and really like the beef flavor 
positive,6/8/21,if you are looking for authentic thai curry this is it after you have made the dish a few times you can tailor it to your liking we like it very spicy so we are generous with the portions and add chili flakes and a little madras curry powder buy with confidence and keep your pantry stocked 
positive,24/6/21,these little fruit cups of peaches are quite scrumptious being packed in apple juice is so much better than syrup and does not destroy the delicate peach flavor the fruit tastes freshly ripened but not mushy each serving is perfect for one person and can be taken to work or where ever without a problem the price for each pack of is good too for now anyway i highly recommend these little just ounces fruit cups 
positive,17/4/21,i am still not a food reviewer the problem is that i cannot turn down free coffee that said this is good stuff mellow with none of the bitter edge common with a lot of the cheaper stuff sold at the local grocery store i subtracted one star from the review because of the ridiculously pretentious ad copy on the box drinking this coffee will not fix the world or make your life more fulfilling i am fairly sure 
positive,10/3/21,marley coffee one love organic is dark rich and flavorful with good mouth feel and a medium roundness of tone not bitter but there seems to be almost a salty undertone to it that does speak of jamaica and blue mountain although the label does not claim it is blue mountain coffee these packets are about one normal scoopful and can be used in single serving coffee makers but i put one in my cup espresso machine and it was fantastic 
positive,17/4/21,i received my order in time the walnuts are very good fresh and delicious there was a slight issue with the package it is a plastic bag there were a couple of small cuts on the bag since the package was left on my front porch for a few hours some ants got into the box fortunately there was not enough time for them to really get into the plastic bag overall i am satisfied with this purchase 
positive,21/1/21,this stuff is great to make egg dishes special it does add a truffle scent but you must cut down on adding other salt 
positive,30/1/21,i am not a coconut oil savant but i got this for my stovetop popcorn popper and it is awesome it is not super greasy very light cooks the popcorn to perfection and leaves an amazing hint of coconut without the sweetness although my husband says it does not get the coconut hint but he misses a lot of hints it shipped quickly was well packaged and is a good price i did not want to buy a ton in case we did not like it 
positive,13/2/21,i have been buying garden of life products for several years now and have tried other coconut oils but still come back to garden of life even though it cost more than other brands it still taste the best 
positive,15/1/21,this soup mix is so easy and tastes great that being said i add can of chicken breast can of white kidney beans can of stewed tomatoes and cups of frozen corn i also add another cups of water so it yields much more than servings and is very hearty overall still a great price 
positive,6/3/21,i never thought one salt was different from another but wow this salt is special it is very flavorful not fishy it really enhances the flavor of food i add a little salt when i make a sweet food and it brings out the sweetness for example add a little salt to the boiling water before you add the oatmeal yumm fantastic salt 
positive,8/6/21,i had tried a tahini before i bought the kevala tahini and i did not like it at all then i found the kevala tahini on amazon and i decided to give it a try i love it it is rich creamy organic and it tastes good i will probably buy it again 
positive,7/1/21,great tasting healthy snack and when i say great tasting i mean it i am very picky about food so it is not great tasting for super health conscious people who only eat bad tasting health bars and it is great to know you are getting a ton of fiber which most of us do not get enough of 
positive,17/4/21,i like that these are all individually packages they are great to snack on or share with other great flavors 
positive,10/3/21,fast service the items arrived the next day our dog loves them and they make great stocking stuffers for the holidays for our dog and the neighbors 
positive,14/1/21,my cats absolutely love all the fancy feast appetizers and this is definitely a favorite flavor they look at me with love when they see me reach for the container and that is the part i like best 
positive,24/5/21,tastes great when you combine pack of twinings green tea and pack of lipton black tea in a hot cup of water and add or more teaspoon of sugar make sure to remove the teabags from your cup within few minutes to avoid the strong bitter taste 
positive,14/10/21,i like these they are crispy and flavorful also they are very colorful which any cook knows is important when preparing food for others place a bowl of these on the table at your next bbq and just wait for the compliments read the nutrition information and compare it to your favorite potato chips and ask yourself why you would want to ingest all that junk when these chips taste just as good 
positive,7/2/21,it was a great gift the recipient loved it he was happy and if he is happy so am i i would definitely do business w these folks again 
positive,29/3/21,tinkyada s brown rice elbow pasta is a great tasting gluten free choice it is just like having normal pasta only better it cooks just like any pasta and can be used in any pasta dish i highly recommend this product 
positive,17/4/21,i like this almond flour very much it is a good price and tastes great i appreciate the texture of almond flour 
positive,10/3/21,this is one of my favorite flavors these lollipops have no competition great flavors to choose from and best flavor in a lollipop yet 
positive,10/7/21,this is one of the best protein bars i have tasted yet that it is vegan and made with more natural ingredients than most bars is a huge plus but the main selling point is that this bar is something you actually want to eat 
positive,27/1/21,i got a sample of this item at a food industry show and really enjoyed it it is delicious and nutritious a great way to start a cold morning it is a nice touch that the pouch can be used for measuring the water 
negative,1/6/21,bad tasting coffee no aroma baked very dry bitter hard harsh and unpleasant aftertaste of burnt charcoal not suitable for espresso and not creamy at all 
positive,20/8/21,i have been eating raw honey for a while now and this is among the best tasting that i have tried it was also reasonably priced unlike some of the other raw honey products that give you a tiny jar for the same price or more than i paid for this large pounder 
positive,14/8/21,i am a jasmine tea lover might leaf organic spring jasmine is so reasonably priced it has the taste of of a tea that make you believe it is a very expensive exotic chinese tea a cup in the afternoon is so special the foil bag keeps the tea fresh 
positive,21/4/21,first of all i was very surprised to get this so fast i just ordered it yesterday and it was at my doorstep before am which never happens anyway i opened it and had a serving and was shocked that it tasted pretty good now for those who have tried vegan drinks you know that they are not always the best tasting thing but this is definitely one of the better drinks i have had i will be reordering this and i will now try the other flavors and hope they are as good as this one 
positive,1/4/21,if this is as healthy as it is tasty then a great product a little pricey for only servings but that organic red dutch cocoa is delectable 
positive,17/4/21,we do not grill steaks if we are out of this product it really is that good in fact we have turned so many friends onto this after having them over for perfectly grilled meat if you love charred outside and medium rare to medium well done fantastic we have tried several other flavors they have and while they are good this is our favorite by far 
positive,10/3/21,i am trying to get away from drinking diet soda so i decided to try sparking water with lemon i love the taste of this brand and amazon has a great price 
positive,22/4/21,this is a tasty flavor but not one i could drink everyday the honey flavor makes it a little sweet for my palette but for a dessert coffee it works wonderfully i will not but this for everyday repeated use but it is a good special treat flavor 
positive,25/4/21,this is our favorite chicken seasoning sauce add orange juice in a bag along with this sauce chicken pieces and toss easy and the chicken tastes better than el polo loco s 
positive,1/4/21,i really like this coffee for both the taste and the size of the cup i can brew one cup and get a full size cup unlike so many of the other selections that only give a small cup of coffee in the mornings i want a full cup of coffee to go i do not want to full around with a small sample besides that the taste suits me we have tried lots of the others but i have since settled on this one for my taste try it i think you will agree with me 
positive,30/6/21,this tonic water is the best it does not contain high fructose corn syrup so it tastes better buy it you will not regret it 
positive,1/3/21,wow we have never had so much macaroni and cheese in a long time and annie s is really really good this does not need additional milk or butter and the sauce is an easy to squeeze out paste in a foil package it tastes great and makes a great receptacle for some creativity of your own too tips to enjoy it just boil in plenty of water the six cup requirement is a minimum drain quickly put the pasta back in the hot pot the remaining heat is just right to melt the thick cheesy sauce into the macaroni do not rinse the pasta in cold water it will make it hard for the sauce to combine well all the deluxe versions are animal rennet free annie s faq is very specific about which ones use vegetable rennet not all do but amazon is not picking up the information i tag the really vegetarian ones animal rennet free whenever i can try blending sundried tomatoes a fresh tomato olive oil garlic pizza peppers salt freshly ground pepper and a touch of balsamic vinegar into a paste this really complements the mac and cheese and gives it a new gourmet taste that still does not take away from the mac and cheesiness of it tabasco chipotle sauce makes a great addition for the adventurous the smoky taste is tempered by the creaminess 
positive,29/1/21,placed my order and shipping was fast the product arrived in great condition and they tasted wonderful i recommend them to other family members who also purchased them after i finish my review i am going to buy more great taste and great value 
positive,17/4/21,the price great the only thing that could be better is an assortment 
positive,10/3/21,i love these meal replacement bars i warm one up in the microwave almost every day for breakfast they are nutritious and delicious and keep me full all the way until lunch i decided to go with the subscribe and save feature and get these for a great price 
positive,30/5/21,i have trouble finding anything like these in the stores so i was happy to find them here they taste great and are a very good bargain 
positive,28/9/21,tastes great good price i eat them after lunch when i am craving something sweet donuts and pastries mess up your diet but these are great to get the sugar you crave in a low calorie treat i get them through subscribe and save best way to go 
positive,6/5/21,these have got to be the best tasting gluten free cookies i have ever tasted i was just blown away by the taste and texture my husband could not believe it was gluten free i will not buy another brand pamelas products extreme chocolate simple bites gluten free 
positive,20/4/21,these taste great very sweet and flavorful without the aftertaste of conventional candies lbs requires a bit of a financial investment but it is a great value if you are a natural candy lover this comes shipped in a plastic bag so i recommend getting a plastic tub or a using an old popcorn tin for storage gallon size or thereabouts 
positive,20/4/21,i hope i do not offend but i am not a regular visitor to starbucks it is not because i do not like them but it is because i usually have my coffee at home their product is actually pretty good from the few times i have been to one of their stores this product ranks high on my list of prepackaged coffees light as i like it but very flavorful it is a nice way to start the day do not shy away from it because it has a chain restaurant brand it is actually pretty good 
positive,21/4/21,loved the depth of flavor in the vanilla flavored starbucks coffee i really loved that the rich coffee could still be tasted through the flavoring the vanilla complimenting rather than overpowering tastes like a true vanilla bean not just sugary syrup i only wish that starbucks and everyone else who has flavored coffee would include nutrition facts on the side not sure why coffee does not see to have to but i wish they would 
positive,2/5/21,i have had many different types of starbucks coffee and there are very few i do not like i do not really care for the more mild blends but this has a nice taste to it i usually prefer a dark bold brew like french but this milder tasting coffee did not disappoint it has a smooth subtle vanilla flavor and is a nice alternative for a change the smell of vanilla fills the kitchen as it brews it is made with latin american beans and has natural ingredients bring the empty bag to starbucks when you are done and you will get a free coffee overall the taste quality i will give stars 
positive,18/12/19,this is a product i have tried before and always have come back to great aroma flavor and value wikll buy again and again 
positive,19/1/20,it arrived in a timely manor and in great shape by ordering on line i saved close to and could not be more happy
positive,19/1/20,the gaint slim jims taste so much better if you keep them in the refrig for some reason make great snacks on the run 
positive,31/3/20,i enjoy slimjim tabasco for the spicy taste and a quick fix for something simple and on the go with any kind of cheese brings out more spice zion
negative,18/12/19,it contains too much fat and when you bite it than you can feel the fat in your mouth it is disgusting 
positive,13/10/19,my husband love monster slim jims alot cheaper to buy it by packs then pieces he ate packs in a month he is something but anyways i do recommend this to everyone great price for great products 
positive,28/9/20,it is a flavorful snack that provides enough flavor but is not too salty nor that boring of a snack it is a pretty good alternative to potato chips or any other snack product 
positive,16/11/20,organic green tea with absolutely fantastic aroma is hard to find this is a great example of a great tea the leaves are very large when they open up which is how the tea is supposed to be aroma is not overwhelming great will buy again and again 
positive,27/2/20,have been using this bean to make the morning mocha s for about months its a good quality bean makes a nice dark flavorful espresso with good crema highly recommended 
positive,26/2/21,i do bikram yoga almost every day and this is by far the best rehydrating drink i have had it is so refreshing and one of these after class cures my thirst 
positive,18/12/19,this quick bread is really easy to make even though it does require extras to be added eggs and cup of melted butter and water it cooks up fast and easy and tastes great it is a bit on the heavy side sort of like pound cake with very few poppy seeds but it is truly enjoyable i would recommend it for an occassional treat but a lot of butter is used so i would not suggest daily intake of it give it a try i think you will enjoy it too 
positive,19/1/20,i do not have time for much shopping and finding any sassafras drink is nearly impossible for me ordering this from amazon saves me time and and gas money it tastes good too i mix it into a mr beer bottle then carbonate it with the fizz giz soda maker in this manor i am controlling what the sweetener is and how much i use the sweetener that you use will make a big difference taste 
positive,13/9/20,i was looking for all natural flavored coffee not easy to find when my college aged son brought some of this home i could not find it locally at grocery stores or starbucks locations so i am glad it is available at amazon it has a mild vanilla flavor not overwhelming like some of the artificially flavored coffees i will continue to order it 
positive,10/7/20,i tried a pack randomly today at starbucks i wanted something different from the banana bread or chocolate covered graham crackers that i would otherwise buy this is some solid trail mix i highly recommend as a matter of fact i am on amazon now to buy more of it so i can let friends try 
negative,14/4/21,thought i would give these a try because i was looking for an afternoon slightly sweet snack bar that is high in protein low fat and great tasting well these are high in protein which i like are low in fat which i like but i think in their processing to make it low fat they compromised on the flavor i was expecting a more natural peanut butter taste but was disappointed with the texture and taste artificial i will not buy these again i am stuck now with the whole box my hunt continues for that great snack bar 
positive,24/4/21,i love this tea my wife is usually the big tea drinker in the house but after trying this in my keurig i have to say i love it i did not purchase through amazon though because i got the same amount in a box for only elsewhere but i would recommend it to anyone 
positive,28/4/21,great tea for the keurig we love it now for a good cocoa and apple cider do not get the green mountain cider 
positive,12/7/21,great keurig tea pods this is not chai latte so do not expect white milky beverages this is just tea flavored with chai spices i suppose if you add hot milk you could make a decent chai latte though but i have not tried it yet very bright flavors but not overpowering 
positive,18/12/19,i really wanted to get a chocolate syrup for my sons to make chocolate milk with but hated buying hersheys because of the hfcs and other ingredients being in alaska options were zero so i ordered this off amazon in a pack to save money hoping it was good and it is we keep ours in the fridge so maybe that is why but it takes a few extra stirs to get it mixed well but the flavor is great and i can rest at ease knowing even though it is still sugary at least it is organic and natural 
positive,19/1/20,this is the greatest chocolate sauce i have ever tried it beats gourmet sauces dairy sauces and any other form i have used in my life and the best part is that it is vegan and contains no nasty chemicals its only problem is that it is seriously addicting to the basic chocoholic 
positive,28/4/21,i love these splenda options and i truly dislike every other sweetener on the market totally light has mixed in splenda perfectly unlike some diet sodas i will not call out by name this read tea peach is very light and refreshing and definitely makes drinking water much more enjoyable 
positive,8/8/20,if you are a lover of dark chocolate marzipan and ginger this product is the sublime combination the the three 
positive,22/5/21,the taste of these teas are great but i added honey to make it a little more sweet 
positive,18/12/19,thankfully it is getting easier to find great tasting gluten free products we have two members of our family who cannot eat gluten due to medical issues so we have to shop with that in mind many gluten free offerings taste dodgy or off but this product is an exception we had this for dinner last night and it was great we served it with shrimp and tomato sauce and everyone loved it we will definitely get this brand again next time we have a chance 
positive,19/1/20,my son loves these for self feeding and it is a good snack on the road in the car or whenever you go to a restuarant and need to keep them busy my son loves them and even i do 
positive,3/8/20,this is better than chocolate i mix it along with stevia in yogurt cottage cheese almond butter whatever i think of also makes awesome brownies 
positive,29/7/21,these work great in reducing nausea for my pregnant wife much better than preggie pops these also taste good i would buy again 
positive,8/7/20,i love this product i have been taking wheatgrass for over a year and this is by far my favorite way to take it many of the other flavors are good too but this one mixes so easily with just milk i also add this to protein shakes for a quick and easy way to get a helping of wheatgrass i have found that it is best to first mix with a little water as it helps the wheatgrass mix better 
positive,13/4/21,the stuff takes a lot of stirring to get it dissolved then drink it quickly before it starts to settle on the bottom 
positive,20/2/21,i normally buy the original green superfoods but the chocolate is quite tasty i mixed it with vanilla almond milk it mixes well enough although you do still get a bit of grittiness i never tried it with just water or milk so i cannot really testify to its taste with those liquids if you like chocolate nice choice 
positive,9/12/20,i enjoyed this tea just plain without honey or sugar it was tasty and refreshing it was good hot and cold very mild and much tastier than just plain green tea i would definitely recommend this 
positive,1/4/21,i like this tea it is one of the better green teas i have tasted it has a smooth and subtle flavor i definitely enjoy it more than bigelow s green tea and it compares favorably to other brands as well the packaging is also very elegant i do not really have much more to say about this tea try it you might like it 
positive,25/2/21,this salt works great in my grinder and is yummy i had no problems with the package all the salt was contained a great price for the amount of salt i am quite pleased 
positive,18/12/19,have not bought these from amazon but i do buy them from trader joes these cherries are very good and the best part is that there is no sugar or other sweetener added which is pretty hard to find the only reason i did not give it stars is because some of the cherries are too dry and not that tasty but the majority of the bag is delicious 
positive,19/1/20,this is item is on my regular grocery list they have a good texture and are tasty i only wish they were organic 
positive,14/10/20,i have tried many of the mtr ready to eat meals and this is one of the tastiest i will buy again 
positive,10/3/21,this salt makes anything better my burgers take on a wonderful flavor i buy more than one at a time so i can share with friends the grocery does not stock this item all the time so ordering is the best way to get it i always have a bottle on hand

positive,14/7/20,very good tasty it is a great feeling to have it while i am watching the crayon shin chan and i think someone will share my feeling 
positive,5/6/21,i like lance products but i was not sure how these would be received both kids loved them they have a good texture and taste great change from chewy granola bars or cookies lance packs these with a small stiff liner so they generally survive in the lunch box without shattering definitely buying again

positive,25/7/21,this healthy request version of chunky chicken noodle is delicious it tastes the same as the regular version which is not true of all of the varities of healthy request soup before i start to warm the soup i add a package of ramen noodles without the flavoring packet the ramen noodles absorb the chicken flavor of the liquid for a great taste and makes for an inexpensive and filling complete meal that is quick and easy to prepare with much less salt than the regular version 
positive,13/7/21,no gluten free diets here but i buy it and make it fat free by substituting apple sauce for butter sweetener for sugar skim milk for buttermilk and extra egg whites for eggs i know sounds dreadful but it tastes suprisingly good the best mix i have tried for the fat free adaptation 
positive,9/7/21,i love this i have made it for cornbread and also to use as breadcrumbs for cornbread dressing it is great to have cornbread again since being diagnosed with celiac 
positive,8/7/21,those who label this as weak and tasteless must be used to drinking straight espresso because this is very good tasting coffee and not weak at all although sometimes i question amazon reviews generally this is a delicious cup of coffee not to strong not too weak i tend to lean towards strong coffee personally i do have complaint though it did not seem to brew a larger cup than that of my other t discs i really doubt if that is ounces that being said i prefer this to my starbucks blend t discs starbucks is a slight bitter in comparison this is richer and a perfect middle ground between dark and light brew with terrific flavor 
positive,15/7/21,if these are as nutritious as they are tasty it is a fabulous alternative to real apples these are not the fully dried apples you may have had they are partially dehydrated with a nice chewy texture they are a little tart but i am not sure if that is the apples or the sulfur dioxide it is a pleasant tart in any event hope sulfur dioxide is not a dangerous ingredient as it is all there is except apples quality of the source fruit is excellent no core seeds skin or other bad bites i should also mention that this is a rather large serving i snack on these in my office and one bag serves as about four calorie snacks for me so it is a much better buy than it might appear 
positive,6/7/21,this company has the best quality tasting baby food so i buy them all even though the packaging is kind of messy to scoop out of this flavor is my little ones favorite and it is made of healthy quality ingredients i have tasted all of their foods and understand why my little one gobbles this right down and spits out other baby food 
positive,13/8/21,i live in a major metrpolitan area and have a vacation home in florida the florida home is in a city that does not have a craft coffee shop i do not count starbucks as a craft coffee shop i puchased an espresso machine for florida and i am using the lavazza pods to make espresso and coffee drinks using espresso the results are outstanding the espresso is bold smooth and flavorful best of all little to no cleanup just toss the used pod in the garbage and you are done i buy the box of and the cost is about cents per pod 
positive,5/6/21,my entire family of love this popcorn we are all big popcorn lovers and are very picky we have converted to this brand my only complaint is that now we go through popcorn twice as fast 
positive,9/7/21,my mom loved iced coffee living in sacramento hot coffee just is not appealing when its outside but you want your coffee fix so she brewed up a whole pot of coffee using the version of the coffee maker the percolator coffee maker the coffee was not that good but you could make a lot of it and then refrigerate it pour it over ice and sweeten and cream it to taste yumm starbucks makes it easier you just purchase the frappuccino mocha pop it into the refrigerator let it cool down pour it over ice and you have delicious iced coffee sweetened and creamed just how i like it what is not to like it is expensive but i suppose when you add in the cost of the half n half the coffee the sugar and the time to make it it is not that bad it is really more of an indulgence than a necessity i like to have a couple of bottles in the fridge during the summer for those times when i want something cold to drink but do not want to have a soft drink iced coffee sometimes is just what you want moderately highly recommended five stars for taste five stars for the convenience three stars for the price over all a winner 
positive,17/6/21,i am an experienced cook but new to indian so this spice box was the best way for me to jump in and test the waters this was out of stock at the time i wanted it so i contacted the ajanta site directly and spoke to the owner and author of the accompanying cookbook who signed my book at their west coast ca restaurant and it was shipped promptly the next day and i rec d it two days later mind you i am on the east coast in ny i could not have been more pleased with the speedy delivery i was impressed with the spice box too everything was in its place and the top of the lid is mapped out in alphabetical order just like a box of chocolates so you can quickly find the specific spice you want a veritable file cabinet of spices someone else mentioned that theirs arrived all jumbled up so i have to assume that it got that way in shipping mine was pristine and thoroughly organized with a gold sticker sealing it down lovely enough to gift having all spices in front of you to see touch and smell is easier to learn about too better than just seeing illustrations in a book all in all as a beginner of indian cooking this was an economical and practical way to try almost of the necessary spices needed for any cookbook of indian cuisine i highly recommend it 
positive,31/8/21,i was looking for a light cookie biscuit to have with tea in the afternoons that was low in calorie and sugar i naturally went to sprouts formerly henry s looking for this first since they have all the natural items i picked these up to try thinking that i liked the taste of honey gram plus they were percent natural and pieces has just calories all criteria s were met later that night when i had them with tea i also loved the flavor i will be a regular buyer now 
positive,7/8/21,since being put on a low sodium diet this has been the best seasoning i have found it adds lots of flavor and has no sodium hurray i love it in rice grits and potatoes

positive,5/6/21,i first tried this tea when my local grocery store had it at christmas time i went back and bought a ton of it because it immediately became my favorite tea i love the peppermint ginger and i love the fresh new bud taste of white tea over green tea leaves same plant different part this tea has it all mildly spicy and smooth yet refreshing i practically live on herbal teas and have tried lots of different ones this is my number one all time favorite 
positive,9/7/21,good herbal tea seemingly air tight individual packages lock in freshness you can really taste the peppermint oil but not in an overbearing way i am happy 
positive,19/6/21,we enjoy the flavor of this tea we use it for hot tea and ice tea using a regular teabag and this pumpkin spice tea mix good ice tea it is good for the holiday season 
positive,5/9/21,my husband and i are coffee and tea freaks we will try just about anything once i really like this tea even if it is not christmas very smooth the mint finish is very nice the ginger note is subdued and not overpowering as i thought it might be well worth trying at least once 
positive,10/10/21,very nice mild taste does not have any burned or bitter taste like most of dark roasts
positive,29/9/21,i normally drink half caff and am very pleased with it but after trying a sample of the tully s french roast decaf that came in a variety pack i was truly amazed at the flavor i anticipated it being bland not much taste but i was sooo wrong the flavor is so rich and robust that a couple times i checked the box to confirm it was actually decaffinated although i will continue to drink the half caf this product has taken the spot on my coffee list 
positive,11/9/21,got for my fiance and she loves the taste and the half calf is much easier for her to handle than a full caff and it does not make her fall back to sleep like the decaf does before switching to half caff she was drinking dark magic so if you want so switch to half caff from that this might be a good one to try 
positive,5/6/21,this coffee tastes so good we have completely given up going out for coffee love the ease of the product and amazons fast shipping with prime
positive,9/7/21,this is going to be a staple in my house from now on good flavor less jitters makes a great anytime coffee decaf can be so uninspiring i wish they would make flavored half caf are you listening green mountain 
positive,26/8/21,when we got our keurig coffee maker i was excited to try new coffees most are way too strong for me i do like flavor but way too often the k cups are more bold than i like this caramel drizzle has just the right combination of coffee and caramel and makes for a nice rich but smooth cup of coffee 
positive,26/7/21,this rice blend is very tasty and has nice chewy bits in it from the addition of the barley and rye berries i greatly enjoy it 
positive,11/9/21,i have been trying with limited amounts of success to eat vegan and low gi amys soups are excellent for this they make it very easy to lose weight one limiting factor is fat cravings eating vegan it is actually hard to get enough fat this is a long way of saying this soup tastes great i can tell it is oily and i love that about it i need fat in my diet or i will lose my mind and eat a whole pizza low fat diets are a travesty anyway creating a market for high sugar high gi products labeled as healthy so this soup brings oil and mushrooms and a very good flavor i have had about a dozen types of amys soups and this is at the top with golden lentil no chicken noodle and trader joes lentil vegetable made by amys 
positive,11/9/21,i would have given this a star but the container was not completely sealed i took off the cap and the seal was partially lifted up i have used it several times and the flavor is great 
positive,15/9/21,this brand has a wide variety of flavors this makes a great gift or when you want to satisfy your sweet tooth

positive,28/7/20,i love this butter it is better than regular butter and makes eggs or anything else taste great plus it is organic with higher levels of conjugated linoleic acid cla a must in every home i think
positive,10/11/19,the package does not lie these are big bars they are also very dense and as a result are very filling they are very chewy so if you have got jaw problems you might want to skip these that is the only thing i did not like about them that being said they have a great peanut flavor and i enjoyed the layer of peanut butter on the bottom i think the peanut butter makes the bar overall a very tasty snack and a nice large bar 
positive,1/3/20,i am not sure that these bars are really all that different from a candy bar they are pretty sweet and not exactly low calorie however they are quite tasty 
positive,3/8/19,dark chocolate cookies taste great i have just tried the peanut butter and those are good too 
positive,6/2/21,these are quite good tasting even though you have to buy several boxes rather than just one at a time the individual boxes are manageable enough for use over a period of time it would be nice as with most things if they were a bit less expensive and also did not have to be bought in bulk but overall they are very good especially compared to some other organic offerings 
positive,24/2/21,these cookies are really good you would not even know they are gluten free if you did not read the package my only complaint is the size is a little small for the money althogh the individual packages are really nice to help with portion control 
positive,13/5/21,taste exactly like what you can get from store in asia beats all the us made products in the taste department also great for making bread not sure why not more us grocery stores carry them 
positive,1/3/20,i was not sure that we would be able to find a powdered milk that my family would like but this is it we would gladly use this product on a regular basis if the price was a little lower powdered whole milk does not have as long of a shelf life as non fat so this should be taken into consideration for long term food storage 
positive,28/7/20,tastes great and so easy to make in the k cup machine little more then i like to spend on kcups but well worth it 
negative,13/5/20,tastes funny it was not labeled from china on the info page when i bought it i will not eat this product will not give it away cannot return it only thing left to do is throw it away will not purchase any food from china my health is more important 
positive,26/3/21,i just bought these fiber one bars a couple hours ago and i am completely satisfied with the taste actually i was surprised it tasted so good i will definitely purchase more in the future the only down side is that it has to many carbs but taking one a day for those times where you need something sweet is perfect 
positive,29/8/19,i am glad i read the reviews saying to only use a few drops in a beverage too many drops and it quickly goes from delicious to strange and bitter the directions on the bottle say drops but i find or is perfect in a oz drink or a cup of yogurt 
negative,7/2/21,i did not like the taste of this at all i tried the stevia packets before and did not like them and i thought this would taste better because of the vanilla flavor but i still did not like it

positive,28/7/20,taste better than sea salt and although i still use sea salt too said to be good for your health in moderation great price quality is first rate delivered on time so keep a jar in kitchen order extras to give to friends sprinkled on salmon before baking is really good and easy

positive,14/7/21,obviously opinions vary on this but i eat enjoy life granola daily i do not understand the comments about it not being crunchy unless perhaps people have had outdated bags i appreciate enjoy life being dairy soy and corn free as well as gluten free as i cannot have any of these the cranapple flavor is the best i mix it with erehwon gluten free brown rice cereal and use vanilla rice milk since opinions differ so on this product if you are on a gluten free diet you should try it

negative,14/5/19,my husband and i have each tried drinking this coffee a few times and it tastes bad a real chemical artificial taste do not recommend it we are throwing away the rest of it which i do not like to do but i would not try to pass it off on a friend

positive,28/7/20,i am not much of a fan of amaretto i followed the advice from other reviewers purchased the variety pack and tried them all the amaretto and vanilla flavors are my favorites i normally do not drink flavored coffee but that is about to change i am so glad to have found this caffeine free option so that i can continue to enjoy a cup or two in the morning i really suggest you order the variety pack first and find out what suits your taste 
positive,7/3/20,i am using rice pasta because a family member is gluten intolerant this pasta tastes so good that everyone in the household eats it 
positive,4/8/20,first you can either soak or spray this product if you are lazy like i am you can put it in a spray bottle spray your produce in a colander in the sink and rinse a bit later i have never had it affect the taste or appearance of food in any way with the exception of when it starts to clean the wax from apples the wax turns whiter starts to chip off when i have used the soak method i have seen the dirty water after so i do feel like this does a nice cleaning job i love this stuff and many grocery chains do not carry it reliably so it is great that amazon has it 
positive,26/12/19,these taste great and exactly like their ingredients also they do not have too much sugar the only thing that i would watch out for is the fat content since each little bar have of fat 
positive,28/3/21,i want to begin by saying that i am no cacao expert this is the first time i have tried it i wanted to try it for three reasons honestly a trusted friend suggested it i am always looking for healthy snacks to fill my day i am on the go constantly cacao s supposed health benefits i am not saying it does or does not have them just alluding to the fact that i am no health nutritional expert so here is what i think these are going to be an acquired taste like beer actually they very much remind me of a red wine a burgundy maybe the bag even smells like wine when you open it up they are very tiny pieces they are very crunchy if you have teeth that are very sensitive i would think twice about getting these upon tasting them on the front of the palate it tasted very much like a red wine then slightly bitter and moving to the back of the palate it tasted very earthy and you got the flavor of cocoa powder then swallow you are going to want something to rinse it down it is a little grainy at that point i like the texture and i like the taste but then again i like wine i have mixed it into yogurt and i find it rather good you get less of the wine bitter flavors and more of the earthy and traditional cocoa powder flavors i use honey flavored greek yogurt i also eat them plain as little nibbles they do not bother me that way either a little wake me up if the flavor really offends you but you want the health benefits you can order organic sugar cacao nibs do an internet search they are tossed with organic cane syrup i will try those for a treat soon that is all i got cheers 
negative,6/2/20,saw this on dr oz so of course i had to try it bitter bitter bitter only way you could eat it was mixed with yogurt and did it help increase my metabolism like dr oz said it would very doubtful

positive,8/9/20,this macaroni and cheese is the only kind that both the adults and the kids in our family enjoy it has a slightly sharp cheddar flavor that makes it taste so much better than the processed cheese food types our whole family swears by annie s homegrown deluxe shells real aged wisconsin cheddar and it is much cheaper buying them here than one at a time at the grocery store

positive,2/11/18,i am trying to get more whole grains in my diet and try as i might i detest whole grain bread these crackers are a wonderful substitute crisp and pretty tasty as well i love them with cheese the only reason i knocked off a star is once you unwrap the package you really need to put the whole thing in a ziplock bag there is no way to reseal so they stay fresh 
positive,14/10/18,i love these noodle bowls they taste very good and you can easily add to them if you want such as chix or more veggies i have referred many friends to using them

positive,9/3/18,the taste is great tropical punch you have to dilute from the measurements they gave you or its way to strong only knock is that if its not drunk immediately it collects at the bottom
positive,18/5/18,i use about and scoops in my oz bottle and it tastes great it allows me to drink more than i would plain water which is the best way to stay hydrated so far no complaints 
positive,27/1/19,i have been drinking the original cheribundi for a bit now but it was a tad expensive so i checked out amazon and they had it for a bit less i discovered they have additional flavors like the ginger cherry cherries help calm inflammation which is why i picked it up the first time i have a bottle about every other day and use it to flavor my homemade kombucha great item 
positive,10/11/19,i do not eat chips often but when i do these are some of my favorites they have all the flavor and texture of traditional tortilla chips but it is the subtle lime flavoring that makes them special the lime flavoring appears to be a seasoning that has been sprinkled on some chips have minimal flavor and i find myself looking for those with the most still none of them have quite enough for my tastes i wish that these chips had more than just a hint of lime 
positive,8/11/19,i bought this for a trial run with my new meat grinder and it was excellent it took a total of two days for shipping and the price was great too 
positive,25/10/21,this is a great tasting healthy drink but for some reason mine did not come with straws 
negative,8/5/20,this has too high of a sugar content i did not know they add sugar to coconut water its supposed to be natural i am trying to avoid processed sugar this is my last order 
positive,28/9/18,i bought this as an impulse buy today i am really trying to cut out soda from my diet i am a pepsi junkie i will admit it and i have the waistline to prove it so i brought my water bottle and honestly i hate water so i shot three squirts of this into a oz bottle and it is good tastes good mixes well it is a tad pricey but it is either that or go back to my pepsi i like it recommended 
positive,29/7/19,buying a latte from a coffee shop or fast food place can be expensive and contain many calories i was surprised to see that hill bros has brought out an instant mix called skinny latte with has grams of fat and only calories it takes tbsp for every fl oz of boiling water and it taste great 
negative,9/3/18,i had high hopes for this product it was reviewed on the local morning news and i got the impression that it was a good low calorie substitute for ice cream in my opinion it is not a good substitute at all it does not taste like peanut butter at all and barely tastes like chocolate my daughter tasted it and thought it tasted gross i would not go that far but i will never buy it again especially since it costs so much more than ice cream i will probably take the suggestions of other reviewers and use it as a base for a shake i have only tried the chocolate peanut butter flavor so i cannot vouch for the other flavors 
positive,18/5/18,excellent fine ground coffee that easily bests more well known brands it is aromatic and tasty without bitterness for the price currently about for can on an amazon subscription you cannot beat it 
negative,17/5/20,i have been buying the fireworks popcorn from amazon and have been very happy with it i bought this to try something different first of all i was disappointed by the rather small container for the price but then i was very disappointed by the taste i use canola oil in an electric popper this popcorn had a slight taste of insecticide i tasted it in every batch from the jar it was a very distinctive and unpleasant taste 
positive,26/3/20,it is a great product i got some while i was in england and brought some home to share with my family my children ate the entire box at no time very tasty crunchy too bad it is so expensive to buy it here in the you s 
positive,24/2/20,since visiting hawaii i have fallen in love with passion fruit juice this flavor is hard to find even in california often other tropical flavors are mixed in this tastes exactly like i expected it too it is very concentrated i am happy with about an ounce in a ounce bottle i add water ice and splenda to taste the directions say to mix the ounce bottle with more bottles of water makes over a gallon as far as i can tell it is unsweetened it does contain some preservatives including cirtic acid sodium bezoate and metabisulphite this comes from brazil great product i use it for juice to flavor greek yogurt and to add to a white or yellow cake for a tropical flavor you can also make a great pie follow your favorite lemon chiffon recipe and use this instead of the lemon juice i will be buying more i bought bottles same shipping cost as one bottle 
positive,3/5/19,this true bar is very tasty and feeling and a great pick me up between meals the flavors are great and and it does not leave you dry in the mouth like some bars do 
positive,27/3/20,the simply bars are the best tasting gluten free dairy soy free bars that i have tried to date you will not be disappointed
positive,31/12/20,i had purchased some extract beans from another company and was looking forward to trying the higher grade beans when i opened the package which arrived promptly i was not blown away by a heavenly aroma of vanilla and at first was dissapointed the beans however were are moist and plump and when i made a custard with them the flavor was rich and heavenly i put the beans into a couple zip lock bags and put them away and a couple days i started smelling this amazing smell like really nice pipe tobacco it of course was the beans i bought a nice airtight container for them these are fantastic and far far better than anything i have ever gotten from the grocery store i will be buying these again and again 
positive,13/1/20,these are better than regular pretzels they are light and crunchy with a buttery taste i am so glad to have found these they restored hope that i can have good food without the aftermath that typically comes with eating my mother who has no problem with gluten tried them and liked them she even packed up some to take with her after tasting them she was surprised because she thought they were going to be salty like normal pretzels 
positive,21/9/20,i was shocked after tasting these to find that i like these better than other pretzels that are not gf which is great due to having to switch to gf diet this makes a wonderful snack and the price is not that bad even in the store meijer s by me and whole foods both carry 
positive,2/12/20,an excellent product that holds up well not soggy and very tasty these rice noodles are especially wonderful in soup on the box there is a terrific recipe i immediately tried my husband and i loved it 
positive,20/11/19,the banana flavor lean body has a great taste it does not have the watered down nutri sweet taste to it either i have been very satisfied with the lean body ready to go shakes so far although i have not yet tried all the flavors my husband usually drinks the pure protien ready to go shakes and he recently got a hold of mine and now he wants me to buy the lean body ones for him because they taste so much better i told him he cannot because they are more expensive then his but i do not think he is going to let me get away with it 
positive,2/12/20,i bought blue sky organic black cherry pop at a local health store along with their orange while i found the orange to taste a bit flat and un orange the black cherry was outstanding just the right amount of sweet not over powering at all i do not like my drinks to taste like they are full of high fructose corn syrup the cane juice gives it the taste it needs and a healthful reprieve from hfc the cherry flavor was decently bold and very refreshing i love that amazon has this pop for sale and as an option for repete orders because i cannot afford to buy it from the health store too often 
positive,11/12/19,i am not a coffee drinker but tea is what wakes me up in the morning this is a great black tea with a wonderful flavor i french press it to bring out the flavor this loose leaf tea is perfect for this i have never enjoyed a cup of tea more than this one 
positive,20/11/19,all of the mrs dash marinates are wonderful they are quick and delicious we initially tried them for their health benefits but the flavor is why we continue to buy them i highly recommend every flavor 
positive,28/6/20,these were excellent for the price the gummies were soft and fresh and tasted great i am looking forward to purchasing them again in the near future 
positive,8/8/20,i have purchased two of these products and the only reason my review is stars instead of is because on my second shipment the cap was loose on one of the bottles and it ended up pouring all over the other bottles in the carton i was wondering why all my bottles were sticky until i hit the one that was almost completely empty otherwise great drink 
positive,14/7/21,everyone in my house loves these cookies even my sister who is not into healthy foods 
positive,2/12/20,my wife and i love to cook this product is excellent we have used it as directed and the results were great pulled pork we also have added our own spin by adding other spices and herbs or a little wine mccormick s bbq pulled pork has never let us down whether used as directed or adding a few of our favorite flavors we have always had mouth watering exceptional pulled pork if you have not tried this product please do yourself a favor and give it a try i believe you will be extremely satisfied with the results our most difficult problem is waiting for the slow cooker to finish blending the flavors but it is worth every minute we wait just thinking how darn good dinner is going to be al schweiger
positive,20/11/19,the basis of my diet is using the zesty italian with little or no oil and i still get that great taste 
positive,1/3/21,exactly how i expected but more gel than paste actually no paste at all just gel like vanilla bean extract but without the alcohol bit great 
positive,5/5/21,knowing that i like ramen my sister suggested that i give these a try i am on my second order as i really enjoy the flavor and texture the noddle s in this yakisoba have a different flavor and texture then what i am use to in the ramen packets that i normally eat but are very tasty as with most of these type products it is easy to prepare and the flavor can be adjusted to your taste by the amount of seasoning used i reason for only stars has to do with the container that is used after it is cooked in the microwave and the lid is peeled off there is a sticky adhesive left around lip not a problem if you are going pour the contents into a bowl but kind of gets in the way when eating directly from the container 
positive,2/12/20,i already loved raisin bran but this is even better i love the almonds and there are crunch bits that stay that way through the whole bowl the flavor is the same raisin bran that i love with a little cinnamon flavor boost and extra crunch i think it is awesome 
positive,20/11/19,i like the original raisin bran and it was a staple in our home growing up but i think i really like this much better when eating the original raisin bran i actually added a little extra sugar not sure why exactly but i always felt that it needed it no extra sugar needed with this new cinnamon almond raisin bran it has the right amount of sweetness crunch almonds and cinnamon i was afraid the cinnamon would be overpowering but it is a perfect balance not sure if the flakes turn soggy like the orginal flakes because i keep eating it too fast to find out my six year old was eating it straight from the box last night and he said it was delicious i would definitely purchase this cereal again 
positive,9/10/21,i like this a lot as a topping on my popcorn instead of butter it is very good and has kept well in the refrigerator after several months i will order more update i bought a second batch i did not have room in my fridge so i have been leaving it in the pantry i have had it a few months now and it still tastes great 
positive,6/3/21,great substitute for soda and taste great dissolves completely with no added residue i will try other flavors from this manufactures 
positive,12/2/21,this is a great tasting coffee it gets my day started off on the right foot 
positive,2/12/20,i am a real coffee lover and am hooked on senseo coffee my regular coffee pot is gathering dust in the corner of my kitchen i recently tried sumatra and just fell in love with it if you like the real taste of coffee you will love it as much as i do highly recommend this 
negative,20/11/19,the coffee maker works fine i am not impressed with the taste of the coffee it tastes too much like instant 
negative,25/6/21,not as good quality as the regular flavors of senseo coffees and we have had our machines for over years medium and dark roast kona and breakfast blend are by far the best sumatra is good also if you like dark rich coffee love the ease of the pod system but will probably go to the k cups just not available enough anymore 
positive,17/3/20,the packaging is not too sophisticated and as another review mentioned it is more liquid than other kinds of tahini but it really tastes great this how i have used it a goya package of dry chickpeas dipped in water for hours then boiled for hours about ounce tahini half a cup water lemon juice salt garlic blend everything until smooth
positive,20/10/21,this stuff tastes great i was not expecting much when i mixed it with my orange juice but i was wrong i cannot claim any miracles in the health department but i have not had any recent cholesterol checks either it makes a delicious smoothie and i will continue to use it because i read and believe the studies on acai 
positive,21/7/20,this was the first product from amy s that i tried and i like it it does not taste like regular chili but i think that it has a good taste to it the sodium content is quite high though so check that out if your watching your sodium intake i think that it is a little too expensive but i will probably buy it again if it goes on sale 
positive,22/2/21,this coffee has a wonderful flavor and provides the convenience of a one cup brew instead of a pot you may also purchases flavors and it is as good as the cup you get at one of the coffee chains the automatic refill program offered is an excellent and convenient way to make sure you never run out 
positive,8/6/21,almost the best home brewed coffee i have ever had and the price is great much less expensive than the grocery store i highly reccomend it if your into coffee
positive,2/12/20,got this for my sister and had a bite as some one who normally eats gummies i got to say i thought it tasted better then the normal sized bears also i do not recommend eating it in one sitting 
positive,20/11/19,love these they taste so good and are good for you i love giving my son something that is not full of un natural sugars 
positive,25/1/21,i have been drinking powdered cocoa for nearly years i consider myself pretty familiar with the powdered add water type cocoas and most of them taste like sand they are gritty and are either too sweet or far too bitter or have no real flavor at all and stay in a thick lump at the bottom of the mug no matter how much you stir with a spoon in nearly years i have only found two brands of cocoa that did not taste like gritty sludge e g swiss miss carnation nestle s one powdered cocoa is from the lds church and it is almost impossible to get in kentucky the distribution center is in indianapolis and none of the wards here seem to have anyone who holds the calling of preparation specialist therefore no one goes to indy very often the second great cocoa was made by cold stone creamery it was sold through walmart and was as smooth as the church cocoa unfortunately walmart no longer stocks it i am not sure it is even manufactured any more yesterday i ran across stevens cocoa it was on the shelf for that is right a measly buck so i decided to try it i knew that if i did not like it i could take it to work and give it away i am in love this stuff is equally as good as the cocoa from the lds church and cold stone creamery one sip and i was hooked it dissolves well it is not overly sweet it has a nice mild flavor and it is just downright good i top it with redi whip for fun but it does not need it it is good without any help i am headed back to stock up on more cans if it disappears from the shelves in a couple of weeks it is nice to know i can get it from amazon i never thought i would fall in love with a product enough to buy it from amazon when the supply dried up on the shelves but i am making an exception for this cocoa it is worth it 
positive,1/7/21,like the chocolate hard to find the other flavor do not know why but no one carries it 
positive,30/9/20,needless to say these cookies did not last long once they were opened they reminded my wife of the tagalongs the girl scouts used to sell very smooth fudge coating and that oh so lovely oreo crunch i could eat these all day viva la oreo 
positive,15/3/20,i love oreos especially these new fudge ones they are now my favorite i have tried both the mint and the peanut butter versions now and while the peanut butter are good the mint is still my favorite that being said these are not bad at all i still very much enjoyed them my two kids year old boy and year old girl both loved them as well whenever they could they were begging for these cookies in my mind that is a good sign if you have got a kid begging for these you have got a pretty good product my one disappointment is that it is not the full cookie it is just half of it maybe they have done that to cut costs but as i recall there was a similar oreo product at one time that offered the full cookie either way still worth it and definitely a cookie i would recommend 
positive,6/7/21,those familiar with regular oreos and really who is not will not find anything too terribly unfamiliar with these peanut butter oreo fudge cremes they consist of a single wafer which is topped with a layer of peanut butter creme then enrobed in a fudge coating the wafer is thin and nicely crispy the creme is purportedly peanut butter flavored but to be honest i was unable to pick up any of that it was still tasty just not as peanut butter y as i would hoped the fudge coating was not too thin not too thick just nicely adding a hint of creamy chocolate goodness what else can really be said about an oreo although i might wish that the peanut butter flavor was more intense i was still quite happy to nibble on them i certainly would not mind doing so again 
positive,29/6/21,these pickles are amazing once you have tried this unremarkable flavor you will not go back to those retail manufactured brand of pickles nothing comes close to these pickles definitely will be a repeat customer 
positive,29/6/21,medium light roast you can really smell and enjoy the aroma of high quality arabica if you are a fan of medium light roast you will enjoy this coffee smooth no burning flavor 
positive,26/7/21,small just right for a little something sweet ginger flavor is good it comes on gradually until it is almost intense a bargain 
negative,21/10/21,the mushrooms i received had absolutely no flavor it was like soaking up cream sauce with pieces of rubber really disappointing 
positive,25/10/21,these colors are so true to life and vibrant the drip drop out of the bottle makes it so easy to duplicate the exact same color again the food color does not change the taste or texture of any food i had no problems with shipping and it was super fast 
positive,29/6/21,i ordered three bags of these with a past order all i can say is yum i did not compare prices too much but this product tasted better and fresher than any i have found in local markets 
positive,5/7/21,i have nasty food allergies to wheat dairy eggs corn peanuts and about dozen other foods so when i find something i can actually eat i have a tendency to buy a case simply put these are great they have a wonderful soft texture with a mildly sweet but not too sweet flavor for anyone with allergies or intolerances like myself they are a real lifesaver they are satisfying nicely packaged and very fresh tasting i will be buying more 
positive,17/9/21,these are the best gummi bears available i got hooked on them when i was in germany i was so happy to see i could get them through amazon 
positive,18/8/21,we searched everywhere to find this jerky it is the best on the market and they ship very quickly we had it in less than days we have already reordered it 
positive,31/7/21,when i first bought this product i thought instant cornmeal it csnnot be that tasty wow i cud not believe it it tasted like the real thing very easy to travel around with and a small flask of hot water very filling 
positive,18/10/21,very tasty and delicious i like this tea very much it has a very good flavour and my whole family likes when i serve them a cup of tea 
positive,29/6/21,i had used these smaller jars of honey while on a trip in france a few years ago they were in the hotels with the breakfasts i do not use honey very often and the larger jars i purchase at the grocery store end up going to waste these little jars are perfect for me the flavor is not too intense and the size is perfect for my use plus they bring back memories of a wonderful trip i took to a country where i grew up 
positive,16/9/21,these are very good i cannot say which is my favorite flavor but i am leaning towards the key lime when i read the review and description i figured they would be crispy but they are normal shortbread with little chips or snaps you might say of flavor i love the packaging of the four flavors as well i will be reordering 
positive,24/8/21,emerald cove organic toasted nori sheets ever since i found the emerald toasted nori i put it everywhere i make sushi with brown rice decorate fish dishes with shredded nori and even fish burritos it has a pleasant fishy taste that i like each sheet has only calories and each bag contain a packet of moisture absorbing powder to protect the nori from dampness also on the back of the bag there is a pledge of organic purity all ingredients certified organic no ingredients have been irradiated i am glad about that because that was my very first concern there is a nice and simple sushi recipe on the back as well and emerald cove nori has no sodium even my cat likes it product of china certified kosher i like that thank you
positive,24/6/21,these things are better than steak filet mignon it was well worth the purchase of this package it saves you a couple bucks versus buying them in the store go ahead splurge yourself and get some 
positive,27/9/21,i love it going to be on my shopping list from now on great as a snack do not need milk but great that way too 
positive,29/6/21,ribs were very tasty and tender and i will definitely buy them again just had to put them in aluminum foil with a little water and heat so easy to fix 
positive,5/8/21,this product is the best raw honey growing up my dad had bee hives in south louisiana and this is exactly how i remember the taste of raw honey i highly recommend this product 
positive,29/6/21,i did not know i was a fan of soy milk it taste great and i have one in the morning instead of cow s milk it is also gluten free for all the celiac s out there no casein or lactose as well i have already recommended this to friends 
positive,31/7/21,we have artifical sweetners for years i tried this sweetner now we only use this the other sweetner do not taste as good 
positive,11/9/21,hard to beat the flavor of this stuff its fresh and clean still not going to blow your head off maybe melinda needs to come out with a xxxxxxxxxxxtra hot version of this stuff but you will still have a hard time finding any other habanero sauce that tastes better on fish pork or chicken still not as universal as tabasco habanero but a great complement to veggies and other light dishes and when you go to firehouse for a sub you can try this on your smoked turkey and you will be pleasantly amazed at the effect great stuff a staple for any decent collection by the way if you like the flavor of this stuff and still crave more heat check out iguana radioactive atomic sauce its got the same basic ingredients as melinda s the same consistency but is about up the heat scale from this relatively weak xxxx sauce scovies
positive,12/8/21,unusual and very tasty as you might expect they taste like okra i wish they were a little less expensive but i do not know of any alternative 
positive,31/7/20,this product sells for at trader joes for only one bag here you get bags for and since amazon ships it the shipping is so fast all you need to add is cinnamon and brown sugar and you are good to go i have eaten this for everymeal and promise you it is great also it is very very filling i have missed oatmeal since being diagnosed with celiac s and am so grateful i found this prodcut thank you amazon for making this much more affordable i will continue ordering it from you 
positive,13/6/20,lately i have been trying about or more sauces to find just the right one that balances flavor and burn but to put this into perspective i really go for the insanely hot so this may need to be measured by that this sauce is not really that hot but the taste is awesome it definately has heat but does not really have much burn in short if you want something that shames commercial pizza place hot wings in both heat and taste this is a great choice in fact i am browsing the internet to see about ordering a case for those days when i do not want my food to have the last highly pronounced word if you follow my meaning 
positive,31/7/20,when i got my miniature labradoodle puppy the breeder recommended getting one of these i am so glad i did this will entertain your dog for hours the inserts are a little expensive but well worth the price for the amount of time your dog will enjoy this product so far she has not been able to damage the ball itself after months for me that means it should last about two years or more before i have to replace it for a puppy dog toy that is everlasting i love it and highly recommend it just a note my dog is small and the medium size ball seems perfect 
positive,13/6/20,stevia is a safe natural sugar substitute that has been used for thousands of years i have used it safely myself for years now is my favorite brand because there is no bitter aftertaste use it in coffee tea yogurt milk cereal puddings fruit dips etc it is truly an amazing produce that keeps my life sweet and not fat 
positive,26/9/20,if you are looking for a fantastic glass of iced tea without the fuss this product is for you just add water your favorite sweetner and enjoy 
positive,17/10/20,i am completely hooked on lipton s glass size cold brew tea bags the small tea bags can stay in your glass of tea all day and never leak leaves like the big tea bags thank you lipton 
positive,14/12/20,we like to make smoothies in our home throw a little yogurt some milk some ice and lots of fruit into a blender and yummmmm but sometimes we are out of yogurt or milk or even fruit or sometimes we want a fruit that is not in season that is where this smoothie mix comes in you put this smoothie mix into a blender with some ice and you have a smoothie w e have tried the peach flavor and the wild berry flavor out of the two we prefer this peach it has a great flavor and mixes up well in addition to using this for smoothies we also use this when we make ice cream this is a great product that will save you time on those mornings when you are rushed and just need something fast for breakfast or a snack enjoy 
positive,29/5/20,i love mrs may s these are not my favorites of what they make but they are tasty and handy to have around the cashews or the black sesame seeds are the five star snacks 
negative,9/12/20,i am disappointed in this product first there is a distinct aftertaste secondly it is not as sweet as they promise and does not work at all in cold drinks if you need a sugar substitute i suggest somersweet not perfect either but better than this sorry i was taken in by the promises 
positive,4/8/20,my year old cat was not eating had to have a tooth pulled and was generally miserable he is always been thin and a picky eater after the tooth was pulled he was interested in food but would not eat i had to squirt it in his mouth a few times before he got the idea i was not going to give up once he started drinking it he loved it and began asking for it his coat is thicker and does not fall out as much he is put on weight and even if he is having a sick day from hair balls he can drink this without throwing up the rest of the day he is so much happier and plays more now even if there is a day when he is not interested in food i do not worry as much because he is so much healthier now thank you 
positive,31/7/20,easy to make without a bread maker and very tasty it is good with everything but we especially like it for breakfast toasted with butter and honey very good value 
positive,13/6/20,i loved this bread very tasty with a good texture and taste i tried making something similar from scratch and it did not turn out anything like this bread slices great warm or cold i bake for my boss and her family and they all voted a resounding yes we like this when i brought her in a loaf freezes well and toasts up great either plain or with butter or cream cheese my boss ate hers with spaghetti after lightly toasting she said it was outstanding and wanted more am i surprised no would highly recommend if you want a good italian style bread i made mine in my horizonetal wolfgang puck breadmaker and used a crisp or dark crust setting i tried all other settings light and medium and the bread came out great with a little different texture but still great nonetheless 
positive,21/11/20,i make bread all the time always look for variety this bread is tasty delicious i have a two loaf bread machine and my husband kids favorite is this one 
positive,25/5/21,we want you to know that we are very pleased with the quality of service your company provides we sincerely appreciate your responsiveness and the way you conduct business we have recommended your company to others because of our satisfaction with your service product we look forward to doing business with you for years to come 
positive,25/5/21,received boxes box was shy one squeeze pack daughter was extremely angry when she did inventory otherwise she is happy will be more cautious reactive if it happens again 
positive,20/1/21,great refreshing nonperishable treat keep it under my desk at work and enjoy an apple whenever i have a craving 
positive,15/1/21,product is as advertised my grandkids love them and i do too great for on the go b brothers all natural fuji apple crisps ounce bags pack of 
positive,8/2/21,i love this chili i have seen amy s products in the supermarket and have been really tempted to purchase any of their products i have had other meatless products that were awful but this was entirely different experience i ts spicy but still holds it flavor and you would never know it is meatless i will definitely order this again 
positive,10/2/21,i like these because they are not too sweet but of course that also means you can just keep eating and eating them without realizing how many you have plowed your way through so be careful a three cookie serving contains calories and grams of fat lots of fruit and the citrus flavor really comes through and as they are thin and crisp they are the perfect accompaniment to a cup of tea because they do not immediately go soggy i am not usually a big cookie person but i will probably be getting these again 
positive,9/10/20,this have been a huge hit with the whole family they remind me of a tea cracker more than a cookie or anything newton they are not overly sweet and have a subtle orange and cranberry flavor the cranberries can be a bit chewy but add to the overall texture of the cookies they also travel well and are great cookies for lunch boxes and toddlers 
positive,31/7/20,these are a pretty healthy tasty snack they are more like a cracker with a bit of dried fruit baked into the product my kids loved them 
positive,13/6/20,what i liked about this product was first the way it was packaged inside there are several rows of thin cookies in a plastic tray you can grab to your heart s content when eaten the cookie and the bits of fruit blend and make a great taste the only qualm is the package wire on the top it is not really easy to close and that may need to be redesigned but the product itself is tasty and i cannot get enough of the bits of fruit what a good idea 
positive,5/12/20,i requested two types of chips ahoy s newest cookies these were tasty and the others were not so do not interpret this review as relevant to similar cookies just these alone the cookies tasty chocolatey and do not have an overpowering processed aftertaste one finds with many foods of this type they are very sweet but you can tell you are eating a chocolate cookie in moderation i had two at most at a time it is decent and easy snack they are very chewy almost a dough consistency but the cookie does not fall apart easily i think the frosting center helps the cookie s structure very good with a cup of black coffee 
positive,1/11/20,we all enjoyed these very chocolatey cookies they have a nice chewy texture and gooey center which complement each other well they may not be homemade but they were still great with a glass of milk 
negative,14/1/21,this product is sweetened with splenda and tastes very artificial maybe if you like diet soda you will like this but the people that sampled it did not 
negative,6/6/21,the seeds are really good but this new flavor is a big time miss the taste is just terrible i bought a whole case i do not know if i will eat them i have to put a bunch in my mouth then put in some water rinse the flavors off in my mouth and spit all the liquid out just to eat the seeds i do not know what they were thinking on this flavor it is rather indescribable they should have made a spicy bbq or cajun instead 
positive,21/7/20,the mtr bisi bela bath is authentic and tasty i highly recommend it you can have this with pappad or some yoghurt on the side and it makes a complete meal 
negative,5/1/21,they came during a heat wave so some of them melted however that is not the issue they tasted burnt and just not that good the ones at trader joe s are soo much better 
positive,23/1/21,i honestly think it makes my regular recipes taste better then when i make them with table salt about half as salty as table salt so the lb bag was a must for me reasonable price great way to lead a little bit healthier lifestyle you are going to eat salt anyway so why not get the extra minerals and a great taste 
positive,31/7/20,good flavor you can use less than the directions suggest and get the same flavor without the thickness of syrup good stuff though
positive,13/6/20,we have been using enjoy life products for awhile due to life threatening food allergies during a walk for faan they gave out samples of this cookie my child loved it and wanted more at the time they did not carry it in the stores so i found it online it was a great purchase it came when expected and the cookies disappeared fast i will be ordering more soon 
positive,1/12/20,i have been using this liquid sucralose for about months on a daily basis and i could not be happier if you are on a low carb diet remember you are adding carbs to your coffee with every packet you open from the anti caking agents but you do not have to be on a special eating regimen to appreciate this because it is so cost effective one bottle lasts me about months for dollars it is easy to over sweeten if you are not careful especially when the bottle is full but you get used to that 
positive,30/1/21,best big train flavor out there and price is way cheaper than finding these packets locally at a coffee shop 
positive,1/1/21,loved the flavor of strawberry and rhubarb texture perfect for me definitely would order again a treat for me 
positive,11/1/21,this is a great dish i thoroughly enjoy it every time i eat it so easy to prepare 
positive,31/7/20,i made these brownies for a function i was attending and did not mention they were gluten free i made two batches and they all went i am not too crazy over most gf items but this is one of the best the price on amazon is much less then the price in supermarkets 
positive,13/6/20,this is the best popcorn ever i wish all stores sold it but so far i have found it only on amazon and some wal mart stores i would rather buy it from amazon of course it tastes great and is also just the right amount to watch a movie at home or to share with a partner 
negative,14/1/21,i recently got a keurig coffeemaker and tried out different brands of decaf to come up with a favorite newman s own is definitely not among them taste very much like a cheap restaurant coffee watered down with hardly any coffee taste i happen to like robust coffee taste and this one does not even qualify as medium if you like good coffee taste in your decaf coffees i would highly recommend the green mountain robust magic and for a little lighter touch the donut house decaf or tully s also of all the different brands i tried the newman s own was the only decaf that gave me an acid stomach reaction not recommended 
negative,7/12/20,ok so some people like it some people do not i am one of those who was excited about the prospect of getting iced tea from my keurig but was sorely disappointed by the taste from this tea it had a very artificial flavor much like instant tea and was no comparison to actual brewed iced tea i can only recommend getting the smallest box you can to see if it suits you like the other reviewer i cannot bring myself to use what is left and will probably end up throwing it out at some point my husband agreed and he is a big iced tea drinker and not all that picky about the taste he will not drink it i will not drink it and the cat will not drink it so out it goes i do want to add that i use the hot teas and have liked them very much especially the green tea there is just something about the iced flavors that do not work 
positive,5/5/21,but as far as it helping me produce more milk not sure it helped much tastes good though 
positive,23/11/20,my husband loves this tea which is not always available at the local grocer the fact that the amazon subscribe save program brings it to our door at regular intervals just makes life easy 
positive,29/8/20,i bought this tea to try something new i was tired of ordinary bergamote teas and now i have ordered it again great taste nice can 
positive,18/1/21,good healthy snack good plain and also i tried mixing with plain yogurt and honey which is a great snack and adds a bit of protein to the meal 
positive,18/6/21,right i know what you are going to say it is granola how exciting can granola be this stuff is delicious normally i need granola to be with something milk or yogurt or fruit cobbler or something like that this stuff i was eating out of the bag like snack chips it has just the right cinnamon taste and the oats taste fresh you know how some granolas seem sort of cardboardy and tasteless this does not the clusters are crisp and flavorful not just cinammon and sweet but hearty and oaty it is like the best part of a healthy cereal minus the milk and the not so tasty part if this came in snackpacks i would buy a ton to tuck in my bag for lunches heck that is what i did with half this bag 
positive,18/6/21,i received one pack of vanilla blueberry clusters with flax seeds through amazon vine and it made a great breakfast for me very tasty and the flax seeds gave it some texture as well my only regret is that i did not get more it was so delicious that i ate it all in one serving i will probably be ordered some more soon 
positive,7/7/21,this whole grain is very tasty the clusters are small enough you can toss it into yogurt or eat as a cereal but they are also large enough you can eat them as a snack lightly sweet full of texture and cholesterol free these blueberry vanilla clusters are very healthy with a high source of fiber of omega fatty acids and of whole grain you can feel good about eating this it is very economical and convenient i look forward to trying other flavors 
positive,18/6/21,the dried blue berry are a little chewy but they taste great i add them to my special k in the morning and talk about a great bm this will do it in fact if you eat to much well never mind just do not east to much without eating a bunch of cheese afterwards 
positive,7/7/21,this snack is good really good the flavors are not overwhelming the texture is nice crispy and crunchy this is great for those times when you need a little something to stop the craving 
negative,1/7/21,really bad taste not natural at all we bought a pack but only used one i wish we had not bought it 
positive,7/7/21,works well taste is good about to order a new box if you are a diabetic this is nice to have around the house or office 
positive,23/7/21,this one by far is my favorite as far as taste is concerned i use this as a snack to get me through to my next actual meal there is a good amount of fiber low in sugar and very few net carbs i really like the taste too 
positive,20/7/21,compare to other nutritional bars out there you will find these are one of the few that are low in calories and pack a good amount of protein grams and they taste great i love these bars 
positive,19/7/21,these cookies are really good tasting the gooey chocolate is flavored just right to my taste sweet but not overly sweet some of the best cookies to come along in years 
positive,18/6/21,these are soft chocolate chip cookies that also have a fudge filling very good although i slightly prefer the megafudge version as these are just a tiny bit sweeter than i prefer 
positive,7/7/21,easy food open can drain water from can take product out fill with steamed rice it makes a great easy lunch i am a big fan i have just got to figure out how to get them out of the can without tearing the packets 
positive,27/6/21,i am so excited to see bobo bars here they are my favorite of all the healthy snack bars and usually have a hard time finding them where i live hooray for bobo s ps amazon does need to work out some of their shipping problems 
positive,21/7/21,these are the best sardines i have ever eaten not as salty as others i have tried place one fillet in half an embasa brand pepper jalapeno whole with the seeds and core removed and you will think you are in sardine heaven 
positive,18/6/21,i saw this at whole foods yesterday and because i am always up for trying something new i bought this flavor i am so pleased with it it is so fresh and clean tasting it does not taste artificial and it does not leave me wanting for more flavor it is really a fantastic organic sugar free beverage and i will be repurchasing for sure i cannot wait to try the other flavors 
positive,7/7/21,this is the best tasting health drink i have had i wanted something with resveratrol but did not want to have to take a pill this tastes like grape gatorade almost really good price wise it is pricey but i am only drinking one a day and it is no more expensive than some people s starbucks coffee in the morning 
positive,30/6/21,my wife and i both love these looking to possibly make a bulk purchase now one caution since you are paying a premium for organic raw sprouted foods made in a family business they go quickly eat them slowly and savor the taste i also recommend goraw s other products as well i like their pumpkin seed based product a lot 
positive,1/7/21,this is first time trying ambrosia pure honey from colorado s w slope and my first implosion is great for the taste and price however i feel the honey is not really pure since the consistency is not as i expected when i purchased it overall i like the taste and the kids do too 
positive,24/8/21,these little things are delicious i did not expect much my wife bought them apparently and they were just sitting on the kitchen table she must not have told me about them because she figured i would eat them all if that is the case she is probably right these things definitely exceeded all my expectations and were good enough for me to immediately come here and right a review they do seem pretty pricey here though but i am not sure what they run in the stores since i did not buy them personally 
positive,21/7/21,these biscuits are very good and my second favorite to the blueberry these biscuits are not filling enough alone for breakfast so i eat them as a sweet snack i wish the calories were lower but that does not deter me from buying they are a winner 
positive,25/6/21,the product is as advertised very good chocolate it is a good alternative for those who do not drink coffee 
positive,13/9/21,this was the time i tried pamela s bread mix it is the closest to regular bread that i have found great product 
positive,18/6/21,i have been a fan of pamela s products baking mixes for awhile now this bread mix is one of my favorites it is really healthy and easy to work with i am always guaranteed good tasting bread when i use this mix i really think it a good deal for healthy quality food i do not have a lot of time to bake from scratch but i do like home made break so this is a good compromise 
positive,7/7/21,emergen c acai berry day count wow what a differnce i feel great getting ready for back to school no sick days here i take it in the morning acai berry is sweet so i add more water to less sweeten
negative,15/7/21,these do not even taste like cashews they are fresh and crunchy enough but you would never know they are supposed to be cashews i do not know anything about roasting cashews but i think it is funny that every other brand seems similar in taste and emerald does not it is not that they have an off flavor they have no flavor 
positive,11/7/21,i had my first taste of this coffee at the cafe monde in new orleans of course with their hand made donuts beneigns the coffee is very strong when you brew it use much less than you would normally use than regular coffee the chicory adds a distinct flavor but also smoothes it out its famous for a good reason but remember to use less when brewing john from buffalo
positive,7/10/21,my cat was extremely ill and i had to give him pills a day he is a big kitty about lbs and was really fighting me or taking the pill and then spitting it out i came across these while searching for something else and decided to try them wow what a difference as soon as he heard me open the bag he came running to get his treat this has got to be one of the best ideas i have ever seen i highly recommend these 
positive,6/7/21,i found this fajita sauce and the related chimichurri sauce at a local global foods mart but after using the bottles up my wife recycled them and i had forgotten the brand name so i spent the next months looking for them ever time we went grocery shopping apparently the local mart stopped carrying them needless to say i bought lots of chimichurri sauce brands most of which were not nearly as delicious as i recalled this brand to be until on a whim i looked up chimichurri here on amazon needless to say as soon as i saw the world harbors label i recognized the brand again anyway whenever i make burritos or tacos i add either the chimichurri or fajita sauce and my family guests now think i should go into the restaurant business p
negative,18/6/21,i am shocked at the positive reviews for this tea it is almost completely tasteless just a slight fruity flavour it does not resemble any green tea that i have bought in the past when living in japan or from asian markets in the usa there is not a hint of green colour in the tea and the leaf is dry large and not compacted at all in the bag in fact the leaves are too big to fit in a tea ball does this tea really contain more antioxidants and polyphenols can not find substantiation from usda they talk a good talk but product is severely lacking 
negative,7/7/21,coffee was burnt had a bad aftertaste and very acidic note sure if a bad batch but this was not good coffee 
positive,27/7/21,i am deployed in kuwait and ordered this for our cookouts we have every now and then arrived fairly fast in about weeks about average for mail to kuwait it has really improved the quality our our steaks i love this stuff
positive,13/7/21,the coffee is very flavorful i would prefer a medium roast if it were available but this coffee is still very good the price is also exceptional 
positive,13/9/21,this is one of the easiest coconut oils to cook and bake with the taste is not very strong so that you can cook non dessert like food with it as well i use it for almost everything food skin hair etc 
positive,7/9/21,i love this coconut oil it adds a great coconut flavor to baked goods i love the coconut smell when i use it as lotion or hair conditioner tastes good and so healthy for you too good bargain when you get free shipping through amazon 
positive,17/4/21,these sandwhich crackers are very good the whole family loves them and they are healthy compared to what is in the store 
positive,10/3/21,this is a great cornbread mix i do not eat gluten products it can be difficult to find good non gluten muffin mixes this is so yummy especially when you add honey a variation of the recipe written on the package i eat it all of the time 
positive,17/4/21,i had been making my own homemade taco seasoning but it is time consuming being health conscious i did not want to purchase any more products that contained ingredients i could not pronounce i am glad i found this taco seasoning as we cook taco burrito meat generally about once each week if not more organic is best and the taste is wonderful 
positive,21/1/21,i have made this a couple times i use the recipe on the back that includes chicken i love the subtle lime flavor my husband worried because it was thai that it would be spicy but it has just the right amount of flavors 
positive,30/1/21,i like the taste no way to tell if it works for diabetes yet i have not taken it long enough
positive,13/2/21,i got a pack of these for free with my last order thanks pier mall very tasty cookie cracker snack with a light touch of honey flavor my friends liked it too i will definitely buy some with my next order 
positive,15/1/21,i am not a coffee drinker because i do not like the taste cafe mocha tastes great now i can warm up and wake up 
positive,6/3/21,i purchased the cafe mocha when amazon was having a sale on the pack of otherwise the regular price is much to expensive and not worth it the mocha was good but a bit too sweet for my taste so i mixed it with a small espresso shot k cup of regular coffee which made it taste like a mocha from starbucks you can also get the same taste if you use a k cup of hot chocolate and combine it with a k cup of regular or decaf coffee and it will still be less costly than the cafe escapes at regular price all in all i am happy with the product and would continue to buy if only the price was better 
negative,8/6/21,this product has bad reviews because it is quite horrible unlike most of the keurig k cups this one tastes very artifical it is extremely bitter and not sweet it seems like it has excess cocoa and artificial sweetner yet all watered down 
positive,7/1/21,we use this ketchup all the time at our house in order to cut down on sugar it tastes just like the regular ketchup to us the bottle with the wide head is handy because you can easily store it upside down that makes it easier to squirt out the remaining ketchup 
positive,17/4/21,saw these featured on hungry girl and decided to order them for my office snack drawer the bars have a decent amount of fiber and protein compared to others that contain mostly sugar they taste delicious not too sweet not too sticky not too chewy the peanut butter flavor is not overwhelming i like these better than my old favorite snack bars quaker s crunchy granola bars and way better than a protein bar taste wise although they are not too sweet i imagine kids will also love them 
negative,10/3/21,i did not like the taste of this hot chocolate and my kids did not either i will not buy again 
negative,14/1/21,tastes terrible i should have known given that it was on sale but i am throwing the rest of the case out i have tried it twice now and once poured it out thinking i had a bad one and the time bearly held it down 
positive,24/5/21,this spagetti sauce is really good the spinach is amazing taste to it you will love this and enjoy it time and time again also for those like me whom are alergic to onions there are none in it enjoy
positive,14/10/21,i run an animal hospital and the dogs loves this dog food my dog loves it too i give a little canned on top of the dry food and the dogs love it the chunks are a good size and it keeps the dogs stool regular 
positive,7/2/21,these are really tasty organic and perfect for a quick on the go snack i would always prefer the actual fruit but if i do not have time for it and just need a snack this is good calories fat sodium total carbos sugar 
positive,29/3/21,i got the sour apple version of the clif kid twisted fruit and even though i am not a kid exactly i still take these to work for lunch they do taste good the first two ingredients are apple puree and apple juice and the rest of the ingredients are added vitamins minerals plus pectin and wax to give the juice and puree structure yes i know these are full of sugar apple juice concentrate is another way of saying sugar apple flavored but as far as a sugary treat goes this one at least has some vitamins and even a smidge of fiber hidden inside it is tasty and i get my candy craving out of the way it is mostly organic so i do not have to worry about my treat putting pesticides into the environment maybe a real apple is better for you but this will do in a pinch 
positive,17/4/21,ordered these for my daughter and ended up sharing them with my autistic niece who is on a gluten free dairy free dye free diet no dairy no gluten and no food coloring in these only natural fruit a tiny bit sour but great tasting for entire family 
positive,10/3/21,this is delicious olive oil and it is a huge can i bought this on lightning deal to have a dipping olive oil it definitely fits the bill it is wonderful for dipping nice bread in i was expecting it to taste like kalamata olives but it is actually from kalamata greece and just tastes like regular nice olive oil 
positive,10/7/21,i really liked this evoo thought it had a great flavor we used it in everything but where it is really good is in salads great stuff 
positive,27/1/21,this is wonderfully smooth black tea that certainly wakes you in the morning by far one of the best black teas i have ever had 
positive,1/6/21,being from europe i absolutely love these they taste great and being sugar free is an added bonus i understand why some americans may not like these as americans in general prefer sweeter foods than europeans but if you are unsure i definitely recommend you try them 
positive,20/8/21,if you are a fan of black licorice then you will really enjoy these licorice bears they are soft yet chewy with a rich licorice flavor 
positive,14/8/21,i am unable to find a sugar free syrup that also does not contain sucralose or other detrimental sweeteners at any local stores joseph s sugar free syrup tastes wonderful and fits in with my sugar free eating plan i also add it on my oatmeal in place of brown sugar 
positive,21/4/21,some pieces were kind of hard to chew but overall i love this jerky taste is great price seems good considering it is dried salmon 
positive,1/4/21,you can get it much cheaper on janeskrazy com love it works great on just about everything especially steaks i also love that it is all natural cannot go wrong 
positive,17/4/21,great tasting tea with or without stevia i drink it hot and cold product arrived very quickly i have or cups daily i probably should have ordered boxes 
positive,10/3/21,coffee is just as good as other fair trade coffees that i buy i have a one one pod maker and these fit in them just fine i do like my coffee a little on the strong side and can use the pod to make a very big cup of coffee before tossing i would recommend this product 
positive,22/4/21,i am giving this stars because it is rice paper and it does taste good there is a learning curve however to using these without tearing them my first batch was there were wraps in the package and i thought i would bake some spring rolls i think i had splits in about half of them my batch went a little better with only about with tears i know i can perfect this with time and patience and these are a really good price so i will not feel bad about playing with my food 
positive,25/4/21,yummy healthy taste great as a quick protein snack the amount of salt is perfect for warm and hot weather when your body will lose salt through sweat and also the salt helps to retain water in your body give it as a gift 
positive,1/4/21,i was able to get a bottle for through a relay for life food sale this is the best juice ever 
positive,30/6/21,some similar kinds of flavored coffees have a subtle mint flavor this is powerful stuff in a good way of course it had a very powerful taste of chocolate mint very fulfilling much better tasting than similar products i highly recommend this 
positive,1/3/21,the maxwell house peppermint mocha is delicious and easy to prepare my husband and i were both big fans of this drink a cross between hot chocolate and coffee 
positive,29/1/21,i am a huge peppermint lover i am also a bit of a picky person when it comes to drink mixes for me many end up being powdery and not as creamy and tasty as i would like that was not the case with maxwell house international coffee peppermint mocha latte mix once you find just the right mixture of powder and hot water you are good to go the container states tsp to oz of boiling water well i always have a big mug when i drink which is about double this not a problem i usually use tsp for my oz mug and it turns out great the peppermint flavor is amazingly refreshing and so delicious it is not overpowering yet is strong enough that the drinker knows it is peppermint flavored for me this is one of the perfect ways to treat myself after a crazy or hectic day curling up with a mug of this peppermint mocha latte and a great book makes a blissful evening i highly recommend this mix to anyone who enjoys peppermint and chocolate 
positive,17/4/21,when i started eating these i did not even realized that they were sugarless and low carb they are so delicious the only ones i have tried are peanut butter i like both crunchy and smooth do not really seem too different i was baffled to see some star reviews but when i read them i saw that everyone was saying that they love these bars but got a terrible quality shipment from amazon so i should add that i only buy these in local stores have never purchased from amazon 
positive,10/3/21,i love these bars the nuts with white chocolate are also great not too much white chocolate so it is perfect the creamy peanut butter is so good it tastes great smooth inside and filling my kids love these too 
positive,30/5/21,these can be hard to find and taste great so good that amazon can deliver them so i do not have to worry about finding them or running out packed with protein and no sugar check out for more details 
positive,28/9/21,i really like these bars the only downside is that they contain maltitol and half of the protein is soy i am not a big soy fan peanut butter is the best 
positive,6/5/21,this is very tasty and has a moderate black cherry flavor with some tartness i understand others comments regarding this having a slightly prune juice quality kind of tastes like cherry juice mixed with light prune juice i attribute this to the pasteurization process plus it is not filtered unlike a lot of prepared juices still i like it 
positive,20/4/21,my hairdresser has jumped on the keurig bandwagon which makes sense because different people have different tastes this chai latte tasted exactly like a more pricey cup from a coffee shop i was very impressed how quickly it was ready the flavor everything 
positive,20/4/21,i get bored with plain water and i drink a lot every day i tried the cherry berry flavrz because i wanted a drink mix that contained no corn syrups or artificial sweetners this product fit the bill and delivered a great tasting drink low cal too try it it really is good 
positive,21/4/21,this does not have a weird sugar free taste it is the best and i always use it 
positive,2/5/21,this item has a great taste i use it in my tea for a touch of sweetness and the essence of vanilla great stuff 
positive,25/5/21,a coworker just brought these into the office surprisingly good sweet and tangy with a good crunch unlike dried pineapple but not too greasy wow definitely check these out if you get a chance 
positive,7/9/21,eatting allergen free can be a challenge and sometimes boxed items have a gross taste but these outback animals taste pretty good and pretty close to the real ones these make a quick easy tastey snack 
positive,25/5/21,dandy blend has such a great taste to me that it is not necessary to buy any coffee when away from home the packets work great i use a spoonful of sugar and a little non dairy creamer that i also carry with me in my handbag i find i have the dandy blend mixture in the afternoon and it satisfies me i will continue to buy dandy blend 
positive,22/5/21,as other reviews have said this tastes pretty good it is the best dried garlic i have tried mine came in the three pack and i hope i use up the other two before they go stale my only complaint is that you cannot unscrew the top you have got to use the built in grinder or break off the top completely 
positive,19/7/21,this is a really good and easy recipe you do not only get the spices but you also get instructions on how to make this complex dish i made it first with chicken and then i substituted it with tofu both times rocked for the price it is a really good buy 
negative,7/9/21,this is an edit of my first review where i said the price was a little high but at that point i had not noticed that both my local walmart and target carry it for less than so do not buy it here though it is a great coffee i use this coffee as a drip grind coffee not french press or expresso where so many people love it it is still stars this coffee is excellent it is called a dark roast but it tastes more like a medium or medium dark roast and does not have much bitter burnt taste so common in such roasts it is woody with a hint of a citrusy taste it is a little creamy and earthy there is a considerable complexity of tastes which reminds me of eight of the clock s bocar blend but bocar is not as bold but it is around the price eight of the clock s columbian my most brewed in the am coffee is as bold with a little less complexity and a more woody taste again at the price it most closely reminds me of starbuck s caffe verona which is a little more chocolately in taste and is usually around for one about same sized bag at amazon 
positive,25/8/21,i have always made fresh coconut cake filtering the coconut milk grating the meat myself these cupcakes are as close as you can come to ones made from a fresh coconut as with most baked goods if you let them sit a while say at least hours the flavor is even more intense of course they have lots of butter in them so how can they not be good 
negative,6/9/21,i have been a licorice lover all my life and black licorice laces are my favorite type of licorice this product has been impossible to find where i live i have searched every store around but no store supplies black licorice laces after finding it on amazon i ordered it immediately but i was very dissatisfied with the taste of gustaf s licorice it did not taste like the real black licorice but some artificial substitute and it was way too soft it did not please me any more than the twizzlers do it is just not a real licorice flavor i would never order gustaf s licorice again 
positive,25/5/21,after reading about yerba mate in eat this not that i had to try it it is a great tasting tea for any tea lover to add to their flavor selection 
positive,7/9/21,this juice tastes great and even my picky two year old loves it it is very sweet so its perfect for those moms like myself who like to limit sugar even natural kind intake and delute down juices with water 
positive,13/10/21,i discovered this milk a year ago and i am now hooked on it i love the flavor way better than regular milk highly recommend it to all you milk lovers out there i buy it by the case and drink it on a daily basis thank you amazon for making it available in a pack 
positive,2/10/21,i brought a box of these along on an overseas trip so that i could start the day with a reasonable cup of coffee before i left my hotel room very good for instant coffee i purchased the italian roast will do so again not as good as my french press but much more convenient when traveling 
negative,23/9/21,this is a poor excuse for coffee even for instant coffee i was looking forward to trying it after hearing good things on the web unfortunately i was disappointed i tried this coffee using the specified instructions and also tried using less water the best i can say of it is that it is weak garbage it is almost like drinking hot water but with a foul taste that will leave you longing for a real cup of coffee if you want fast coffee allow me to suggest a keurig special edition gourmet single cup home brewing system instead 
positive,26/6/21,it is hard to believe the instant coffee can have the same taste as brewed one 
positive,25/5/21,for people who are gluten sensitive this bread is a god send it is easy to make with a bread maker and has a great taste 
positive,7/9/21,we are not gluten free but my mil is i bought this to have on hand when she came out for a visit and then never got around to making it we just made it recently to use it up and get it out of here expecting mediocrity at best but it was surprisingly tasty it had a bouncy springy texture we ate the entire loaf at one meal with bean soup which i keep wishing my kids would like but they will not so they ate a lot of bread so i cannot attest to its keeping qualities but fresh from the oven it was great it smelled awful raw so i was skeptical but smelled good baking and tasted great i think i will keep a bag or two around now just as a way to have easy fresh baked bread for dinner and maybe one of these days my kids will learn to like bean soup my husband did the actual mixing as far as i know he followed the directions exactly i may try some of the tweaks suggested next time it does call for an odd amount of eggs that would be the only complaint 
positive,15/7/21,this product is easy to make and has a great taste i just wish it was gluten free a simple change in the soy sauce used would make it that way just like the general tsao s chicken by the same company 
positive,3/6/21,i like flavored coffees those where you can really taste the flavor it claims to have well this one does it is delicious and you feel like you are enjoying all the calories and good taste of a cinnamon roll in liquid form only you can rejoice because you are not getting the calories i will be buying this item lots more 
positive,27/9/21,this is a smooth coffee with a good taste i do not like overly sweet flavored coffees and this one is perfect it has just the right flavor and it is not bitter at all 
positive,19/6/21,great value great taste nothing like a cup of caribou without having to leave home would purchase this item again 
positive,25/5/21,has a nice taste and consistency to it it is very slippery after its cooked so it definately does not stick like regular pasta feels a little lighter in the stomach as well not like a giant glue ball like regular pasta seems to be a nice healthy alternative 
positive,7/9/21,i will start by saying that this is the first popcorn i have popped since i have had my machine but this popcorn tastes great i seem to like it even more the next day 
positive,3/8/21,my husband and i love this coffee it has a nice smooth taste sets our morning off to a good start even though it is d caf delivery was fine no problems at all 
positive,5/9/21,this is great tasting ketchup i waited till i found one before introducing my kids ages and now i do not care what they eat red dip with hubby also said he liked it better than our regular ketchup 
positive,25/5/21,for a chocolate chip cookie this is a tasty product but for a source of protein at the same calorie count as a candy bar this cookie tastes ridiculously good 
positive,7/9/21,i have been fan of celestial seasonings teas for some time and this is one of my favorites something strange happens in the packing because flavour differs a lot from one box to another the one i am tasting right now has a lot of cinnamon while others have a better balance of ingredients eventhough they all are great teas and the star rating suits them well 
negative,11/9/21,i got this tea thinking it would be a nice tea reminiscent of the kind of hot cider drink you might get from a coffee shop what i got was a rather unpleasant experience when i first opened the box at work my co workers said this tea smelled like the cinnamon chewing gum big red when i got to the first sip i encountered the sweet flavor of the apples before i was quickly overwhelmed by the very bitter taste of cinnamon it felt like two siblings who were not on good terms with each other face scrunching ensued i will not be finishing this box 
positive,13/7/21,love this cheese i use of these containers per year refrigerate once opened and it will last till the expiration date 
negative,22/7/21,this product was very tasteless and boring i felt like i was eating packaging material awful awful awful awful very bland 
positive,22/6/21,our kids love them and i have been known to sneak a few here and there too all natural organic ingredients names you can pronounce and know what these are made out of no hydrogentated oils or high fructose corn syrup it is nice to have the variety of flavours too 
positive,28/7/21,while it is a bit pricey i enjoyed this water as a nice alternative to just plain water i enjoyed the flavoring of the watermelon it made it easier to make sure that i am hydrated 
positive,13/10/21,a neat package cheap of very tasty lichee flavored gummy candy each piece of candy packed on it is own guarantees the freshness yummy 
positive,19/2/21,i like these sausages better than other products from this company yes they are a little expensive but worth it i v tried them boiled fried and grilled with excellent result highly recommended check for specials for free shipping since it saves about off the total price 
positive,14/12/20,i had a friend from canada who always used to send these to me but unfortunately she moved and could no longer send them to me these taste just like the ones i used to get they are my candy bars 
positive,14/12/20,it is really good and delicious i would buy it again and recommend it really tasty thank you good product 
positive,19/2/21,special k bar is a quick fix to a sweet tooth without a lot of calories involved 
positive,10/1/21,this is my favorite tea of all brands and all flavors i drink it cold with no sweeteners of any kind of course everyone is preferences for food and drinks are different so well someone may say they do not like 
positive,26/3/21,i love this product the taste is great and it is very easy to prepare my family loves this product 
negative,24/3/21,i opened my box hoping for a great snack to go and what a dissappointment it tastes like the fat is rancid in these i opened another box to see if maybe i got a bad box but they were just as awful my dog will not even eat them 
positive,24/2/21,this is the best rub i have ever used my aunt turned me onto it and i would not use anything else on my prime rib filet minon or any beef it is the bomb 
positive,19/2/21,i originally found this product in a specialty shop in monterey and am so glad to have found it here great fresh garlic flavor i love it on steaks but the wife likes it on fish actually no fat but you would never know it very versatile 
positive,14/12/20,not the best rice ever but pretty good have not seen it in any stores around my area so i would probably order this again 
positive,19/10/21,i was hoping to get a great price on these with subscibe and save but i will wait until they do i drink these all of the time but wait to buy them when it is a bottle 
positive,18/5/21,i bought these thinking they would be a handy emergency meal but found that they have a great taste i have tried adding a little hot sauce and a little worcestershire sauce wow even better the oz cans are very convenient i recommend these to anyone wanting something smaller than the usual oz can 
positive,19/2/21,i purchased their matcha green tea powder cafe grade a while back and i fell in love with it their powder comes in this little cute reusable tin the taste of the tea is smooth and not bitter i make green tea milkshakes and it is the best that i have purchased i highly recommend it i wish they offer their cafe grade powder in a bigger can i use to work in a cafe where we had green tea powder in foil bags and they did not seal well and when we opened the bag we would be covered in green powder and it was such a waste plus i really like the tin and want it in a bigger size 
positive,14/12/20,this is a great tasting pod we drink it alone or make a double cup by brewing it with donut shop or vanilla to create a new flavor 
positive,1/6/21,very tender meats sole is awesome good value i order a lot of omaha steak products and have loved them all 
positive,1/4/21,fantastic juicy and tender everything was great is great there is only the of us but next time i may even order with the desserts included 
positive,15/4/21,i do not usually like rice cakes but these have a nice taste and are very filling the only downside is that this pack comes with so many of them and it takes up a lot of space 
positive,19/5/21,these sunflower seeds are larger than the standard sunflower seeds you can usually find in your local supermarket usually the david s brand in my area so there is more inner seed to eat there is also a lighter coating of salt from the brine wash on them so while there is enough salt to make things tasty your lips are not going to go numb from all the salt quite as quickly as with the other brand the shells are easy to crack with your teeth and they break cleanly also the bags are filled with full shelled seeds there are very few broken ones i devoured the first batch i ordered and i am now ordering a second batch if you like snacking on sunflower seeds i think you will like these 
positive,19/2/21,not much you can say about water i love sparkling water and the addition of some natural lime flavor is great love this and go through about cases a month 
positive,14/12/20,okay so it does not taste exactly like pumpkin it does sort of have a pumpkin essence however maybe it just sort of smells pumpkin y either way the tea is delicious my co workers tease me about how many cups a day of it that i drink personally i like it with a packet of truvia natura s calorie free sweetener ounce packages pack of or nunaturals nustevia nocarbs blend packets as far as the comment another reviewer made about the black tea tasting like lipton s maybe that makes it more authentic it is said that chai tea was first created in india to make undrinkable tea bearable 
positive,28/7/21,the taste is very good oat bran is much more creamy than one minute quick oat it just does not tastes like oat a perfect food for somebody on diet just one single tablespoon of oat bran would make you feel very full 
positive,29/6/21,newman s own special blend extra bold is a great tasting coffee for any time of day it is flavor stands out even with cream i like strong bold coffee and this is my favorite every day general use coffee 
positive,15/10/21,i had this cake for my birthday it was delicious it was nice and moist and fluffy and tasted like pumpkin pie without the crust i like the filling for pumpkin pie no bad aftertaste or anything at all we put a dollop of cool whip on top instead of frosting we have had other sweet n low cakes in the past and they have unfortunately tasted lousy this was a pleasant surprise 
positive,20/7/21,i add this to the sugarfree cappuccino just to give it a flavor it tastes great and does taste like york peppermint pattie flavor 
positive,12/10/21,my kids love this white cheddar snack but it is not always easy to find in our shopping area this was not cheap but we are happy that we can order pirate booty through amazon the oz bags are the perfect size for their school lunches the taste is cheesy and light love them 
positive,19/2/21,pirate s booty aged white cheddar tastes very similar to cheetos white cheddar snacks without all of the calories and fat even my teenage son who hates anything healthy loves them they are great when you crave a salty snack and do not want a b zillion calories 
negative,14/12/20,i was hugely disappointed with this product the walden farms line of calorie salad dressings are great this alfredo sauce is not do not waste your money on it 
positive,2/7/21,i fell in love with these delightful candies when a friend brought them back from a trip to germany a perfect combination of hazelnut chocolate cream and crispy wafer they are adorably cute as they resemble little hippos i am not a big fan of chocolate but this is a wonderful flavor combination and a tasty little treat 
positive,11/3/21,add to aniything soup salad meat brings up the flavor nicely packed easy to use arrived on time clean and fresh
positive,10/4/21,when i read some of the reviews that mentioned eating these tiny morsels by the spoonful i was skeptical but guess what i am doing lol i love them 
positive,22/7/19,i really enjoy eating these bars they have a very natural and clean taste to them the only thing i would like to suggest is a less sweet version of these bars are offered they are a little too sweet for my taste but that does not take away from my enjoyment of eating them 
positive,2/2/20,i have a gluten allergy so i am always looking for an alternative to cookies muffins granola bars and other sweet snacks that i can no longer eat the kind bars are great i have not found any that i absolutely do not like but some i like better than others the fruit and nuts in yogurt is definitely my favorite i like the combination of nuts raisins and yogurt it does not seem as overpoweringly sweet as some of the others i originally discovered kind bars at starbucks but they were very expensive to buy on a regular basis that was when i checked out amazon s subscribe and save program signed up for the kind bars and cut my purchase cost by more than half with no shipping cost what a cool program especially for those of us with allergies who need regular access to products that are usually expensive and or hard to find 
positive,2/2/20,the product was delicious and arrived in a timely fashion however i did see them cheaper at one of those wholesale stores 
positive,31/8/19,good product right amount of sodium a little high on calories though kind fruit nut fruit nut delight all natural gluten free bars pack of 
positive,22/7/19,these bars taste quite good although i agree with other reviewers that there is a strong coconut taste fine with me as i like coconut i have ordered three times and the bars have been fresh each time i find them sticky which makes them a bit messy if eaten while hiking or on a road trip everyone i share them with polishes them off quickly personally when i look at the ingredients in kind bars i do not have many fantasies that they are particularly healthy honey is sugar fruit and nuts are concentrated calories healthy fresh fruit vegetables and dairy will do a much better job of ensuring that i get the vitamins minerals and antioxidants that i need gluten free might help some folks i do not doubt that if you eat little pieces of the bars spaced out over several hours they do not encourage glycemic spiking when compared to a snickers or some other candy otherwise i simply regard them as a tasty snack that should not be expected to be anything more than that 
positive,12/1/20,these by far are the best tasting gluten free bars ever and at a very reasonable price low in calorie and a great after work out snack 
positive,19/2/20,i love the kind bars they taste great and are much healthier than other bars also they satisfy your taste for something sweet so are healthier than eating candy 
positive,27/11/19,thought i would just try this and i am glad i did great taste and the delivery was very fast we bbq all the time and i now have a new favorite well worth a try 
positive,12/12/19,this organic protein bar tastes great my cousins told me about the organic dark almond chocolate bar this one is good too 
positive,26/9/20,it is a spreadable jelly sweet but not too sweet with a flavor of lime it tastes very good for a jelly and i would consider buying it again in the case i wanted to buy jelly 
positive,22/7/19,i love these nuts i particularly like the cashews and almonds a bit overpriced though and once you start popping there is no stopping until the pack is done 
positive,2/2/20,i bought this hazelnut paste nocciola spread at a local shop in palm cost florida the taste is excellent and healthier than nutella 
positive,23/5/20,recently enjoyed these teas at a high end restaurant after returning home we ordered some more online they arrived promptly and were just as delicious 
positive,22/11/20,the black walnuts come in large pieces not whole or halved they are fresh taste good and i will buy them again in the future by the way i read in breakthrough eight steps to wellness that black walnuts have some unique health benefits 
positive,30/3/20,i love this cereal i have never been a fan of cocoa crispies but i am a fan of erewhon rice cereals so i decided to give this a shot it is so tasty and addictive without being disgusting sugary like the regular brands that i find myself eating it for breakfast and sometimes dessert 
positive,8/7/20,this almond butter tastes very good and it has a pleasing creamy texture i will buy more even though it is expensive it is worth it on my restricted diet because of the convenience and the good taste 
positive,4/1/20,this water enhancer was really tasty and you do not have to use a lot of it to flavor even a large glass of water the flavor was good without being overpowering and it is fun using the little bottle my only complaint is the price at per bottle kraft s listed price on their site not amazon s you are paying more for the bottle and the wow factor than the actual flavoring itself while this is a really good product i do not imagine i will be spending four bucks on less than two ounces of flavoring and a futuristic bottle 
positive,30/1/21,i just squeezed some into some water and drank the liquid mixed with the water with little agitation you can use as much or as little as you like i did a second shot my drink was light refreshing and not overly sweet it did not taste like snapple for example but i enjoyed it i plan on getting more 
positive,2/11/20,this offers a quick way for a tasty drink fill up a glass of water and squirt as little or as much as the liquid in the glass and viola peach tea yeah not really peach tea but still tastes pretty darn good they say uses but i probably got only or so since i either wanted my drink a little sweeter or used too big of glasses the current price on amazon suggests more than five dollars a bottle i think that is pretty steep but i would probably purchase some more individual bottles to try other flavors 
positive,17/10/20,mio liquid peach tea has a great taste the bottles are small so you can toss one in a backpack or purse and take it with you to add to your bottled water it is easy to add too much to your water so start slow and taste first before adding more i would really recommend this 
positive,22/7/19,o n e coconut water is by far the best tasting coconut water i have had and i have had just about every brand out there the great taste let us me hydrate my body better than regular water because if o n e was not available i would not be able to palate drinking coconut water 
positive,2/2/20,o n e has a good taste for packed coconut water if you are used to drink coconut water it is important to know that it will never taste like a fresh green coconut i also make ice cubes with coconut water to use in cocktails and whisky it tastes great 
positive,4/10/20,this coconut water takes great i have tried many other brands and this is one of my favorites and i am not sure why everyone is so worried about the expiration dates i just ordered two boxes from amazon and the expiration date is dec so months from now 
negative,1/4/20,i first tasted this product at the grocery store i bought the container and loved it unfortunately the taset of the one coconut water from amazon was horrible it had a strange taste as if it had been left out in the heat it was a rancid flavor i will not be ordering this again i will purchase it from the grocery store where i can take it back easily and quickly 
positive,8/5/20,this is the only drink that has effectively replaced the urge to drink diet soda for me low in calories and super refreshing at lunch its like i am on a tropical beach looking at the ocean at work now that is nice 
positive,18/6/20,i really enjoy this coconut water tastes fresh and has good nutrition with no added ingredients i usually put it in our morning smoothies along with some strawberries bananas and flaxmeal 
positive,20/8/20,being originally from a latin american country coconut water is one of those essential summer week end drinks that we not only enjoyed as refreshments but loved for all the no nonsense nutritional information our parents would throw at us about it and though it is been a while since i have had a real hard shelled coconut spliced open to insert a straw and enjoy this little pack did its job of refreshing me with that wonderful taste and make me feel proud of the nutrition i was getting out of it packaged in a handy little container it keeps the product fresh and with all its flavorful attributes delicious refreshing nutritious it is definitely worth a try and you long for the real thing but are far from a tropical beach this might be your best substitute 
positive,1/6/21,it is light and refreshing i have tasted fresh coconut water right out from the coconut the western coconuts like the ones from the caribbean are a bit on the salty side but the sweet ones are from the tropical areas in the far east like indonesia so comparing this to the western coconut water it is way better and much more refreshing comparing this to the indonesian coconut water it is below par all in all it is still pretty good 
positive,4/7/21,what a great thing to wake up to i feel these k cups are of medium strength with just enough of kahula 
positive,5/2/20,what would i do without amazon this is the only place where i can find all the keurig existing and the price is great the coffee tastes good does not taste like alcohol just coffee like good buy
positive,22/7/19,if you like kahlua this is a great coffee the aroma is wonderful as it brews and the flavor is mild not overpowering 
positive,2/2/20,this was the best ever fruitcake loaded with fruit and nuts lite on the cake as it should be not like others all cake and not much in the way fruit and nuts the only problem i had is that it is all gone and fast must now order more 
positive,22/11/20,i could not find this tea locally anymore so i am glad i found it at amazon i have been drinking this tea for a number of years now and probably would not go back to regular tea 
positive,1/3/20,lipton french vanilla is hands down one of the most delicious black teas available i am thankful i can continue to purchase it through amazon since it is no longer available in stores 
positive,23/11/20,this is my favorite lipton tea sadly all the stores in my town have stopped selling it so i have resorted to buying it at amazon let us pray they do not stop offering it 
positive,5/4/21,i like to munch a few nuts as a snack in moderation a lot better for one than eating potato chips this is a nice taste treat there is a smoky taste to the almonds which is to the good on the down side there is probably too much salt here unfortunately since salt produces health problems for people so i would not want to eat these tasty treats every day but as a snack from time to time these almonds really hit the spot 
positive,27/4/20,i bought these gums not knowing what to expect but as soon as i tried the first one i knew i made a good choice these things are great not too hard and not too soft and they are really sweet but do not taste artificial would highly recommend this product 
positive,8/3/21,i went this way and that way for almost a month before ordering and when i finally did order these chips i wish i had ordered more i made the mistake of sharing with friends we all love this product and it is perfect for anything from snacking and dipping to use in casseroles excellent flavor and taste love them nutritional value is not that bad compared to alternatives but chips are chips and these are worth it 
positive,30/1/20,i really like this soup and i am typically not a big vegetable soup eater the one thing i want to mention is that in the ingredients i believe yeast extract is just another name for message 
positive,22/7/19,item as described texture of gummy softer than a normal gummy bear probably due to size very good though 
positive,2/2/20,another great tasting gluten free product has lots of flavor and because they are individually wrapped they are great to include in a packed lunch 
positive,2/9/20,this is a very nice full bodied coffee with a very delicious taste it is a nice favored coffee to wake up to in the morning i would reccommend this coffee to a person who likes a medium strength and blend coffee 
positive,26/1/21,i am not a health nut and i had to keep an open mind with this product but once i tried it it actually tasted really good just a tip do not eat it by itself not good try it with smoked salmon and cream cheese or make an avocado and turkey sandwich also toasting it for a few minutes will soften it a bit 
positive,9/1/21,the dried mango has a very good taste very sweet the chunks are not difficult to eat like some other brands the only but is the pieces are a bit too small to my taste 
positive,30/7/21,i will definitely order this again it melts in your mouth the texture is light when i brought it to work the whole bag disappeared in minutes 
positive,30/10/20,good value easy to dispense and they taste great my husband has them for a snack every day and has me reorder when they start getting down he wants them on hand 
positive,3/8/20,i have been gluten free for about three months and as someone with a sweet tooth i have been a bit bummed lately at the lack of easy and quick treats i can find or keep on hand i went to the health food store and bought one of these individually to give it a try i opened it in the car and almost went back in for more right then only the rain and a need to get on with my day held me back i will most definitely be buying more if you like macaroons these are fairly similar crunchy but chewy soft sweet and tasty 
positive,29/1/21,i bought these because i did not get the almond balls these coconut nut butter balls tastes much better my kid likes it too 
positive,24/10/21,these breadsticks were wonderful with hummus and spinach dip wonderfully light and crisp with just a hint of herbs i will also add addicting i rated it only a star because the shipping was careless half the boxes contained broken breadsticks and i really wanted to serve them upright hopefully amazon will take note and ship with padding next time 
positive,24/10/21,a great coffee at a great price i subscribed for regular delivery now i will always have the perfect cup just seconds away 
positive,16/10/21,my wife likes flavored coffee and this is by far her favorite great taste medium brew excellent value too we order this brew regularly guests enjoy this coffee as wel 
positive,24/10/21,i have purchased many different brands of this type of fruit this is by far the best tasting of all i have tried it has no off putting bite to it many do i love it so much i cannot stop making my homemade pannatone i guess i can thank you for these extra pounds if you use this type of product i am italian so i do i highly encourage you to give it a try maria domenica
positive,25/9/21,i bought this pack from amazon as i had one of the flavors at the local market and wanted to try some new ones it tastes great make sure to follow the recommendations some flavors say do not shake and some flavors say shake slightly 
positive,19/10/21,pops up great in the microwave a handful of kernels in a brown paper lunch bag folded up and taped shut for minutes with almost no leftover kernels i am a popcorn seasoning junkie but this popcorn is so fresh and flavorful that a little butter and salt does the job it is also been my experience so far that snappy is a little less prone to getting scorched than grocery store popcorn higher moisture content maybe either way it is nice to have fewer unpleasant burnt surprises 
positive,20/10/21,i love the quantity and flavor of this tea it is a little messy opening the pouches the matcha can get all over your fingers and counter but oh well i purchase this at costco because the price is way better my only complaint is that i wish it were organic 
positive,19/10/21,great tasting snack like viewer said taste like sugar smacks my husband and i enjoy eating the puffed cakes calories fat awesome puffed cakes and a glass of fat free milk is good eating thank you amazon jesus bless us all 
positive,15/6/21,all flavors were very good often times with variety packs you end up with some good flavors and some not so good flavors but the whole family ate all flavors up in no time 
positive,4/8/21,i am very pleased with this sherry vinegar it is a little costly but has a wonderful robust taste and really makes a tasty vinegrette 
positive,4/8/21,these go great for movie watching with the kids at home the amount of the candies sold here will last for many movie nights 
positive,18/7/21,tasty and soft my toddler just loves them they are a little pricey and there are very few fruit snacks in a bag 
positive,18/10/21,its a great tasting energy boost i have tried a few of the energy drinks out there and never liked the taste or the jittery feeling i got i highly recommend the raspberry acai drink 
positive,15/6/21,i bought this salt on a lark because i did not want to drive miles to the nearest store that carried natural sea salt but i will buy it again the flavor is wonderful i am not a big salt eater never have been just do not like the taste of commercial salt but this sea salt is wonderful i real winner that enhances the flavor of food instead of covering it up as regular salt does 
positive,4/8/21,good quality rice cooks well and has a good overall flavor no need to rinse first as with most asian rice 
positive,8/6/21,i have been looking for gluten free plain crackers for ages being pregnant all i wanted in my first trimester was some plain crackers but i thought i had no options being celiac there is some nice rice crackers out there but they all are flavored with onion garlic bbq etc not things you want during pregnancy i found these recently in a local high end grocery store and was so happy to see plain i tried them and i had to laugh at myself for getting so excited over plain crackers they are super good with by themselves or with butter cream cheese etc they are great for soup as they are full of flavor and have a crispy taste they are also not high in salt like most other crackers great buy too i highly recommend if you like me just want some nice crackers without the salty flavor added to them 
positive,15/6/21,surprisingly tasty and a great texture i was excited to find these in my local grocery store in the passover section my expectations were low but these delicious crackers made me a believer 
positive,4/8/21,i bougth yahuda matzo style last month i wanted to try it before passover i love the taste and texture the biggest problem is that about a third of the box i opened arrived in crumbles i did not check the other boxes because i need them unopened for passover i hope the boxes arrived in better condition i will try and make matzah balls with the crumbs and use them as a coating or toppng at these prices i am not going to waste any of it i am going to buy another pack of so that i will have enough to serve during the holiday for myself and family members who can not eat wheat i hope you keep this item in stock as long as possible as we eat matzah all year long 
positive,25/9/21,this would have gotten stars but i decided due to the fact it is pricey and i feel it could be more reasonably priced than it is otherwise i was hoping it would be my answer to a saltine cracker that i miss so much due to being gluten intolerant i was very pleasantly surprised the cracker was very tasty and had a nice crunch it is perfect to crumble in tomato soup or to eat plain or with anything on it i really love this product it makes a great snack when i just have to have something to crunch on 
positive,19/10/21,if you are a coffee lover this is the way to go grind these fresh beans and make a full strong coffee that is delicious 
positive,4/9/21,the coffee beans are great fresh and shipped fast great prices will continue to order these coffee beans as long as they stay fresh and reasonably priced 
positive,31/8/21,my girlfriend uses this product in her coffee to disguise the coffee taste instead of using sugar she adds half a package and some milk she loves it it tastes great on its own too 
positive,9/10/21,we were eating a meal in hawaii with some aloha shoyu on the table we did not think anything of it until we tried some and found that this tastes really good different from kikkoman and the like if you like soy sauce be sure to try some of this 
positive,15/6/21,i love how fast you can fix this thai peanut in the take out type of box just add hot water ster then eat it tastes great and is fast to fix this is not the same thi peanut that comes in a regal type of box that is cooked in a pan on the stove top i like the taste of this one better and it is easier to fix 
positive,4/8/21,i searched long and hard for this product and i was thrilled to learn that they had the exact ice bars that i was searching for the customer service was the best and shipping was extremely fast thank you for making a hard to find product in the you s accessible and the costs were reasonable i will definitely order again from this seller 
positive,15/6/21,this syrup is an amazing addition to any kitchen it is delicious and smooth and goes very well with chai tea 
positive,4/8/21,great price for a great product this is much more subtle than green tea and tastes great with a little cinnamon 
positive,15/6/21,excellent product and excellent service from this seller lime pickle is a must have relish as part of an indian feast but my favorite everyday use is as a garnish to tuna salad 
positive,4/8/21,it was pleasant to receive these in good condition the cups were inside a cardboard box while inside another main cardboard box with bubble padding none of the cups broke 
positive,1/10/21,i rarely can find this on the keurig website it is usually sold out plus it is more expensive if you love chocolate you should love this i recommend it 
positive,1/7/18,the kids in our son s party were super excited that they had flavors to choose from before i made their cotton candy and what colorful flavors too cherry grape were the favorites the cherry and blue raspberry were the most colorful 
positive,10/8/18,this was a good purchase tastes good pretty colors seems to go a long way i used at a family reunion with a bunch of kids and they raved about it i hope what was not used holds up for next year i put it away so as not to be tempted very happy 
positive,1/7/18,these sugars are so good they make great light fluffy cotton candy they work extremely well compared to using hard candy they all taste great i would highly recommend these for anyone making homemade cotton candy they taste as great as boardwalk cotton candy 
positive,10/8/18,healthy choice fresh mixers are a tasty option when you need a quick microwave meal on the go with their compact nonperishable packaging these things are perfect for carrying to the office in your purse so the office cadger will not steal them the pasta turns out just right and the sauce is pretty good too the rotini with zesty marinara sauce has a nice garlicy zing to it the portion size is just right for an entree it is a little small if it is comprising your entire meal but if you are eating at your desk chances are you did not have time for a full meal anyway the plastic handles on the bowl stay cool enough to make it easy to transport this to your desk no more trying to find the tepid spot on a flaming hot piece of microwaved cardboard so you can goose walk it down the hall before your fingers burn a couple of things lowered my rating by one star for one there is a bit more sodium than i am entirely comfortable with in a product aimed at the health conscious two there is quite a bit of plastic packaging with this meal it is nicely layered into a small package that can easily fit into a purse or briefcase but when you take the layers apart you cannot help but think of landfills or the great oceanic garbage patch all in all this is still a decent option for days when you know you are going to be too busy to either go to the deli or make a sack lunch with bean curds to turn off any would be fridge thieves 
positive,13/9/18,my favorite cereal period i enjoy this every morning with some unsweetened almond milk taste so much better than the similar cheerios but has nearly twice the fiber you cannot go wrong with this 
positive,17/7/18,i love eating soba noodles and this is the best sauce i have found so far i just add some scallions and it is awesome 
positive,16/1/19,this price is amazing we are a whole foods family and we use this for our baking and on our waffles and we love it way cheaper then the grocery store 
negative,16/1/18,i can tell you from experience that it is not hard to make healthy low calorie low sodium soup that tastes good calories for this soup are ok and it has a few carrot pieces in it for a little extra nutrition however the taste was totally bland it is commendable that they used less salt however they could have added a little rosemary and or garlic for example and produced an enjoyable taste without one bit of extra calories or sodium i also found the chicken to be overcooked and rubbery as were the pasta curls that they think are noodles yesterday i had a can of progresso classics vegatable that was the same calories more nutricious and full of flavor even the old fashioned small can of campbell s chicken noodle is a better bowl of soup than this no more healthy choice in our pantry 
positive,16/1/19,smells more like blueberry than it tastes however it make a great iced tea and sweetens nicely with agave syrup i enjoy it 
positive,1/8/20,i have opened hundereds ifnot thousands of cans of peeled italian tomotoes and for the money these are as good as i have ever had as good or better than campania pomidori pelati very red rich and sweet 
positive,1/7/18,these are great tasting it is like a mix of raisin bran and honey bunches of oats i did the subscribe and save and it really does save you money 
positive,10/8/18,over years of gluten free baking this mix is the best chocolate cake mix that i have tried i usually find other gluten free cake mixes to be pretty dry this one made very moist cupcakes with great chocolate flavor i do not think i would be able to tell the difference between this and a cake made with wheat flour and they were easy to frost no stray crumbs sticking to the frosting spatula i will definitely buy this one again 
positive,15/2/20,i was very pleased when this arrived at the door opened it immediately dug in was not till later when my wife got home told me it was for the dog not me just kidding our dog does like this beneful we get many compliments on her smooth coat she is fit full of fun energy very healthy dry dog food has added advantage if you have to curb your pet dogs do like variety too beneful has several different flavors you may want to change it up every other bag or so this lb bag lasts about a month for our lb lab sounds funny for a dog to be eating corn tomatoes other veggies the reality is these ingredients are fillers to keep the cost down other brands may be healthier but are going to be more expensive we selected this brand because that is what the rescue center fed her and our vet said this was fine 
positive,22/4/21,tastes great no bad smell as others mentioned came in days with prime and no problems have not experienced any gas yet i am trying to build my tolerance slowly 
positive,25/9/20,i really enjoy this peanut butter it is sweet and a treat it is not entirely smooth it has a slight granule texture maybe because of the honey mixed in otherwise it is one less jar to grab if you like honey and peanut butter 
positive,16/11/19,i just started taking benecol smart chews so i do not know yet if they will lower my cholesterol i am writing this review so other people will try them and not be afraid that they taste bad they really are good they taste just like a carmel candy 
positive,9/9/20,these chewables are delicious do not know about the results of lowering cholesterol i will have to wait until the next dr exam yum
positive,1/7/18,i take a day and will update when my bloodwork is done again i am hoping for the best the taste is better than i thought it would be 
positive,10/8/18,product arrived quick and taste great not sure yet how effective it is yet but it is easy to take 
positive,15/1/20,i love the taste of the benecol smart chews i am hooked on these and my mom is also taking them it is great to have something taste good and help your cholesterol thank you 
positive,1/9/20,this product was recommended to a group of us ladies by a cardiologist who spoke at one of our meetings she said her patients were getting fantastic results taking this to help them lower their cholesterol ldl levels my ldl needs to be lowered by points and i do not want to take medication so i decided to give this a try i have taken it for two months but it will be a few more months before i have my cholesterol level checked at that time i will know if this works in addition to taking this i have been eating steel cut oatmeal for breakfast and have cut way back on beef 
positive,22/7/21,was recommended to drink hibiscus tea to lower blood pressure hibiscus tea is expensive this is not as expensive and tastes good too i would drink this even if not for high blood pressure comes in a big zipper close bag in retail box best deal on hibiscus tea 
positive,1/7/18,i bought two different teas from this company and they both where very good this was my first time purchasing anything from them and i was very pleased with the integrity and strength of the tea 
positive,10/8/18,i really like halter bonbons they have a genuine fruit taste and are not icky sweet like some sugar free candy cherry strawberry and orange are my favorites i do wish they came individually wrapped they are often hard to find and somewhat pricey but in my view they are worth it 
positive,14/5/21,so i bought these when i saw a great deal on deals woot com about a coupon they had and i had seen them in stores a few times but never took the plunge these are tasty although sometimes a little hard for my taste and a little higher in calories than i would like in a snack calories per bag but it does satifsy my sweet tooth nicely and is much better than candy or a donut and easy to tuck in my gym bag or desk drawer the single size is nice because it is easier to do portion control than counting out chips into a plastic baggie still on the fence if i would order again but that is because of calories not taste taste is great 
negative,17/10/19,i did not like this product at all it made everything i used it to make taste the same horrible 
positive,3/10/21,this syrup tastes very good not quite as good as starbucks but comes close 
positive,15/9/20,i use this every morning for the protein low calorie lots of protein and i love the coffee flavor not a fan of the hot but i throw it in my magic bullet with ice and water frozen and delicious 
positive,30/8/20,this protein drink tastes great and i only make it with water it is probably be even better in a smoothie 
positive,1/7/18,i do not usually like protein drinks i do love coffee and was looking for a good iced coffee mix this fits the bill perfectly plus it is good for me i find the vanilla flavor very nice the texture not very chalky and the amount in the canister perfect i mix with milk never tried water it might not be as tasty that way 
positive,10/8/18,i like this protein powder on its own it is too sweet and has more caffeine than i should have at one time so i mix one scoop of it with a scoop of eas whey chocolate protein powder and it makes the perfect protein drink for me i use this product daily 
positive,5/12/19,i have been drinking the mocha click on a daily basis for almost years now and was very excited to hear a new flavor was coming out the vanilla click is very good and a good option if you do not like the slightly thicker consistency of the mocha click i will be ordering both flavors each month from now on 
positive,21/10/19,i was originally using the morning blend which had a good taste but i think this blend is smoother also the price is a little less so it is a win win situation 
positive,8/9/20,this is one of the best peanut butters i have ever tasted a bare minimum of sugar and exactly the spice level i would have expected to the person who gave it a one star common that is ridiculous you should have atleast given three stars for innate quality and being a product that actually lives up to the label omg spicy peanut butter actually being spicy who would have thought 
positive,22/9/21,i was a little hesitant to buy the cocoa bean flavor after reading the reviews saying that it is not the same as chocolate because most of the proteins i have been using are chocolate flavored i am glad i ended up with cocoa bean i took the advice of some other comments to heat it up and it really does taste good as hot chocolate the other thing i like about it is that it mixes very well with water when i am at the gym i do not really have a choice between water and milk but it is not a problem with this protein 
positive,2/10/20,great taste i have tried many types of protein this one was by far the best i have ever had 
positive,25/7/20,i bought my first rj s soft licorice log today and it is absolutely the best black licorice i have ever tasted 
positive,4/7/21,excellent old world flavor and style it has been years since i had salame this good or natural no message etc almost impossible to find anyplace else i wish someone locally carried it but i am glad i can get it online 
positive,11/9/21,i drink this between brazilian jiu jitsu and submission wrestling class to recharge taste great lime is my fav 
positive,4/7/21,this product tastes better than other coconut juices i have tried i love that it is not sweetened i would prefer it come in disposable cartons rather than cans but to me the taste makes it worth purchasing i like this size also because the larger sizes are too much for me to drink at a time the size makes it great for lunches and snacks too 
positive,21/9/21,i discovered think thin products at my local trader joe s market but the per bar price was a bit high then i saw that amazon sold them and had so many more flavors i have been ordering them one by one this is one of my favorites i like the crunch of the nuts and the sweetness of the white chocolate it may be a little too sweet i like the darker chocolate with the nuts better but if you are looking for a different taste with the crunch of nuts this is a good choice i use them as a breakfast food mostly they do not raise my blood glucose and that is good 
positive,11/9/21,tried all crunch bars was pleasantly surprised with taste of each not as filling as the high protein think thin bars but good for light snack very nutty sweet a keeper 
positive,12/10/21,these make a great snack not too sweet and an excellent way to get fiber into your diet
positive,11/10/21,the product is fresh tasting and enjoyed it i had trouble with the lid which kept falling off and was soon lost 
positive,28/9/21,honeysuckle pear is one of three flavors of drink chia i personally like the strawberry and mango more but this one still tastes good some of my friends like this one more than the others they only have calories and grams of sugar and contain lots of omega omega iron potassium calcium fiber protein magnesium they are extremely healthy this is all from the chia seeds you can see inside which gives it a texture that is new and fun to drink the seeds themselves absorb more than ten times their weight in water so when you drink them they hold onto it keeping you hydrated longer great for workouts and sports it is all in an bottle so it is easy to carry in a bag or in your hand wherever you go 
positive,19/10/21,this is the best waffle mix around cannot find in the store but glad that i was able to find them online for such a reasonable price 
positive,4/7/21,this tastes exactly like the white hot cocoa i have always gotten from my coffee shop have i found their source would definitely recommend 
positive,11/9/21,nice mild taste though there is a strong fish odor in the juice the cats loved that there are a lot of bones and skin reminds me of when mom would make sardine sandwiches very tasty though and no after taste and though no salt is great i am going to try the no bones or skin type next wild caught is great too
positive,12/9/21,i am usually not the biggest fan of green teas but this is really really good it has a third of the caffeine as an ounce coffee with lemongrass spearmint passion fruit and plum flavors i was an instant fan and the fact that it is healthy for your immune and digestive system are added bonuses 
positive,13/7/21,if you like apricots or peaches this is the energy bar for you it is completely natural tasty not overtly sweet and the minis are a prefect dessert or snack size buying it on amazon is the best deal i found for these especially with the subscribe and save option in grocery stores you are paying close to for the same box 
positive,23/10/21,these little nut squares are delicious there is just enough sweetness to make you feel like you have had a real treat but not so much that you get a sugar high with a crash nuts have protein so these snacks stay with you and give you a needed boost in the middle of the day or anytime 
positive,22/9/21,i wish gevalia came with an option for whole beans but as pre ground coffee goes this makes a great sunday morning treat it may be a little rich for some people as an everyday cofffee but if you like candy coffee you will probably like this 
positive,4/7/21,this product is the usual gevalia finely ground coffee full strength it did not seem be all that great i enjoyed it much better when i blended the product with regular coffee maybe it is just the way i brew coffee that is wrong or i have the wrong kind of brewer basket instead of cone like the gevalia brand brewers i am not a big fan of flavored coffee of any brand because i think they processor can mask poor grade product with fancy additives it has very good dark chocolate flavor i am not sure how good a value it will as i do not have access to that info at this point 
positive,11/9/21,i have been wary of trying this since most people complained about the chocolate being quite tart thank goodness i gave into my own curiosity my boyfriend and i love this treat it was originally for him but once i had a bite i pretty much took it from him and nibbled like a hungry mouse the sweet blend of chocolate and strawberry flavor is amazing i wish i had purchased more of these bars 
positive,8/8/21,taste fantastic somewhat hot if you consume a lot of it at once but nothing to be fearful of it is the perfect hand made taste hot sauce to replace your over the counter cholula tapatio for all of you meal choices 
positive,9/7/21,we love this cereal one of my daughters eats this every morning for breakfast i like that it does not get soggy so quickly i have even used this to make gluten free rice crispie treats we subscribe to this and a case arrives every month at a price you cannot beat 
positive,24/10/21,i ordered the chocolate and peanut butter cereal i made granola bars for my husband who has celiac disease they were very good even i could not help myself to this yummy treat 
positive,4/7/21,armed with her recipe book and flour blend we are able to make fabulous gluten free food the only bad thing is we make way more desserts than we should because they are just that good not only are they so good that you cannot tell they are gluten free but they are better than anything i have ever made gluten or not delicious 
positive,11/9/21,the maple syrup tastes really good and sweet i use it in cooking and on pancakes a good deal i will buy it again i like supporting a us family company too 
positive,24/10/21,this sauce has a unique flavor and a decent kick i like a very hot sauce and this is not as strong as my usual choice it does however have a very unique flavor that i enjoyed i have used it on a number of dishes and was really impressed with the way it jazzed up my homemade vegetable soup i will be buying this again 
positive,22/6/21,i have long been a fan of the maxwell house international coffee line so i was excited to try this flavor if you are a fan of other pumpkin spice drinks at unnamed large coffee chains you will definitely like this product i like that you are able to add the amount that you want and the mix blends very nicely and evenly this is a perfect treat for a cold winter s night 
positive,30/7/21,my wife and i have been eating these for over a year and really like them we slightly prefer them to newman s own but of course that is personal taste 
positive,10/7/21,i eat oatmeal almost every morning in the fall and winter this is by far my favorite variety pack i stock up when it is on sale because i can go through a box a week the variety pack is nice because it keeps it from getting monotonous peaches and cream is the tastiest and nothing beats hot oatmeal after shoveling snow or walking the dog 
positive,4/7/21,second week in a row in the lighting deals pick it up fast great taste but very light after taste 
positive,11/9/21,i received this gift box as a gift and completely overlooked all the other candy in my house i am going through a total eighties phase right now and this retro candy was perfect i do not know what else to say except that i love this candy gift box 
positive,20/9/21,this tea has a wonderful taste of blueberry it is even wonderful iced as a treat for family and guests alike everyone who i have surved it to has loved it 
positive,13/10/21,i have never been a coffee drinker so i have always ignored keurig machines i got these since my office has a machine and really enjoy it the tea tastes perfectly brewed if you like english tea and have access to a keurig this is worth the purchase price 
positive,2/8/21,as always this tea was quite tasty but it was delivered to a home a block away that is vacant so i had to retrieve it highly recommend the tea use it alone but sparingly or mix it with a black tea to mellow the flavor 
positive,11/6/21,as many other reviewers pointed out this is a very spicy tea with a strong cinnamon taste it is absolutely delicious with no added sweeteners and is the go to tea in our house 
positive,2/8/21,a friend introduced me this good earth tea which i found very flavorful the first time i tried it i was glad to find that i could buy the tea on amazon and have now given it as a present to another tea lover 
positive,18/10/21,i like corn and come from the northeast where fresh local corn is a common spring summer side item so i would like to think i know from corn i tried a can of glory s corn over the winter by way of comparison and thought it was pretty tasty good stuff 
positive,23/7/21,the switch watermelon strawberry was a good drink i thought it was a little too sweet for my taste but not by much one serving size was fluid ounces it contains grams of sugar and grams of carbs per serving and each serving was calories according to the label it contains of the recommended daily allowance of vitamin c the drink has a slight carbonation to it that was a lot less than soda the small and skinny can makes it good for inclusion in a lunch box although i liked it i do not think it is worth the price of nearly a can but for the convenience of size it might be worth the trade off on occasion 
positive,8/7/21,i like this fqavor of this product a lot and if you want carbonated fruit juice then this is the stuff for you i do suggest though that you refrigerate it because it does taste better cold
positive,11/6/21,this stuff taste just like flavored carbonated water in this case flavored with strawberries and watermelon i imagine it is better for you than plain soda i really found it tasty yet not overpowering in it is flavor as some of the other flavors 
positive,25/6/21,loved this drink the sweetness level was just right and i really liked the fact this is juice without corn syrup or refined sugar i did not really think the watermelon strawberry tasted like watermelon or strawberry but it was a really nice pleasant flavor the carbonation was just right i also liked that this drink did not leave a weird aftertaste or a lingering flavor on the tongue like some other sodas or juice drinks this had a very clean flavor that was very refreshing 
positive,2/8/21,i love the taste of this tea it did not induce my labor only walking seemed to get the ball rolling and of course i cannot tell you if it toned any of my lady parts but i had a very quick smooth labor so maybe it did something i am now weeks postpartum and i am about to order more just because i like the taste of it i enjoy this one much better than the milk maid super satisfied 
positive,11/6/21,this company is very accommodating and was quick to re ship my missing ups shipped order the general manager took care of the problem personally and quickly this company definitely has my future business they have a fantastic product and even better customer service 
positive,9/7/21,i absolutely love this product and most of the flavors it is not sold in stores by me any longer so was delighted to find it here much better than the same type of drink sold by the other big name company s 
positive,22/6/21,i am surprised by many of the reviews that are here especially those saying this coffee tastes weak when i serve it to company they often ask about it and cannot believe it is decaf it has the heavier taste of starbucks which i love i use the normal amount for a greaat cup of coffee 
positive,2/8/21,this is the best ham base they also make excellent chicken beef mushroom and veggie base i have ever used it works great for ham gravy and ham soup it enhances ham flavor in many ham dishes too made with natural ham pieces and no message a little goes a long way for making gravy highly recommended for ham lovers 
positive,11/6/21,if you purchase this your money is well spend this product from guyana is perfect and taste better than the yr 
positive,8/7/21,the only thing you are missing by eating this instead of wheat pasta is the carbs it is got a really great light taste the the bag makes a deceivingly large amount of cooked pasta 
positive,28/9/21,very tasty slightly smokey tea as appropriate to this type a little dusty thus the stars vs but did not seem to seriously effect flavor would recommend to others for the price organic is a plus 
positive,23/8/21,this is great almond butter i was buying almond butter at whole foods and the last two containers were watery i thought i would give this a try and i am glad i did 
positive,1/8/21,we can no longer find these baked guiltless courmet in our area stores so i am delighted to be able to buy them in bulk at a terrific savings from amazon they were shipped very quickly and were intact and delicious 
positive,16/7/21,this espresso has a very smooth coffee taste i used it first in a press and then in my mr coffee espresso machine the espresso definetly tasted better when pressed the price was excellent considering you get cans 
positive,2/8/21,i started taster s choice from original gourmet after i bought french roast i found it labeled darker than the one i was drinking i am afraid that it will be too strong after i tasted it i am so glad that it is the right taste for me it is so convenient i love it and highly recoment it 
positive,11/6/21,we have been enjoying this seasoning on our steaks for some time but this packaging is an great improvement we first started buying it at a wholesale club where it was sold in a plastic grinder the grinder was a pain in the wrist to use i am so glad that weber now sells it pre ground in a shake on container plus the grill lid shaped cap is a cute touch i definitely recommend this seasoning as it is just the right combination of flavors for a charcoal grilled steak i would even use it on chicken or pork as well 
positive,26/6/21,i love taco bell so i knew i would love this sauce i have used it on chicken veggies baked potatoes and most recently i put it on my mashed potatoes you can use this in many ways salads meats etc the taste is creamy rich and spicy but not too spicy it has a little kick to it and if you like jalapenos then you will like this i am not a big fan of alot of spices and when i cook i really cook plain but i do like this product it is not too much and not too little if you want to add a little zest to your every day meals this is a good way to go this is an update weeks later ok for me this sauce is not too spicy however i served it times to company one time i used it as a dipping sauce for veggies and another time i used it for a topping on taco night in my house both times my friends and family said it was too spicy for them i personally like a kick but they all found it too spicy but they loved loved the taste it was just too spicy one of my friends actually started coughing and asked for a glass of water so if you like spice but not heat this is a great sauce there are many many ways to use this and it really can stretch your budget by adding zest to boring ole chicken and fish however it may be too spicy for those of you not used to it but it tastes great 
positive,20/8/21,i put this on some basically a chicken fajita and was not bad like taco bell s other sauces this one does recreate a taco bell type taste which may be a good or bad thing depending on your perspective i still like taco bell s spicy ranchero sauce better despite being jalapeno this is not a very spicy product 
positive,25/8/21,just wanted to let everyone know that i have been using crystal light packets for most of this year ever since i tried one actually i like the lemonade in summer but i like the iced tea year round and it is actually my favorite what i usually do is use a gatorade bottle after it is been emptied or drank of course and fill it with ice from the ice maker since those cubes fit put the crystal light in add water and shake instead of buying water i just refill it from the tap and re use the bottle great taste and easy to make 
positive,19/10/21,this maamoul has a good taste for both the date and the cookies it is soft and does not smell bad because of the packing i recommend it 
positive,2/8/21,good quality very tasty complex and smoky flavor very mild though break it up into bags and freeze it if you do not drink it everyday 
positive,11/6/21,we have been using this syrup for years and now so easy to have it delivered right to our door wife is diabetic and we really watch her carbs she is been able to stay off shots for years now with products like this we cannot tell any taste difference from regular we used to before the new sweeteners came out we have noticed when we ask for sugar free syrup when we eat out this is the only brand restaurants carry 
positive,22/10/21,my wife introduced me to these we bought them at the japanese store in epcot after we would eaten the two we bought i wanted to find them on the web so i was pleased to see you could get them at amazon this is a tasty noodle dish it is not what i first thought a soup it is really noodles with a spicy mustard mayo soy sauce mix it is easy to prepare as well the ingredients are all with the pack and it just requires boiling water the container is pretty neat too a built in strainer that let us you prepare the noodles and then drain the water without needing any additional utensils or bowls it is a little expensive if you just want ramen noodles it is much more exotic i am going to try it 
positive,6/8/21,taste just like reg animal crackers i love them tried them from the grocery store first in the mexican food section they are delicious
positive,24/6/21,it is moist it is filled with all the things i love in fruitcake candied cherries dates and lots of pecans and none of the stuff i do not like best of all it is available year round i am also impressed with the service the carrier dropped it off on my porch last night this morning i had an email from the folks at organic mountain making sure i had received it 
positive,17/4/21,the reason why i bought this because it is using halal beef the taste is great a little sweet and not to chewy we love it and will order more later will recommend to my friends 
positive,10/3/21,i was so happy to find the green mountain coffee pumpkin spice on amazon com it is a seasonal product that i absolutely fell in love with over christmas some of the other pumpkin spice flavored k cups that i have tried smelled really nice but had absolutely no flavor this one fills the kitchen with that spicy aroma and has a full flavor i even run through a shot on smaller cup size it has that much flavor 
positive,17/4/21,this is definitely my all time favorite flavored keurig k cup pretty much tastes like a pumpkin spice latte from starbucks 
positive,21/1/21,i was apprehensive of buying a flavord coffee i had a bad run in with a cinnamon flavored coffee recently this pumpkin spice coffee is very tasty it smells good and it leaves my dorm room with a plesant aroma the only downside to this coffee is it is a very light roast 
positive,30/1/21,it was great to find this caribbean cake here its truely a real caribbean rum cake i was in puerto rico only weeks ago for days and i could not find a caribbian cake anywhere thanks to amazon 
positive,13/2/21,these rum cakes taste really great i get them for myself and also get them as gifts last year i bought one for everyone on my team at work they absolutety loved them and talked about how soft and moist they are i am glad i know where to find them as i buy them all the time 
positive,15/1/21,this is the best rum cake i have ever tasted the first time i had this was in the cayman islands to know i can stay here and still get them is even better 
positive,6/3/21,moist delicious with a delectable rum flavor it was a bit on the very sweet side but overall a memorable dessert experience 
negative,8/6/21,recently i was over watching the celtics game at my friend s apartment as the game grew more and more intense i consequently grew more and more parched hey brian i said you got anything to drink yeah he replied i have got some lavender soda in the fridge lavender soda i asked skeptical where does a person even get lavender soda it was sitting on a table next to a couch in the furniture section of marshall s so i bought it brian replied i walked to the kitchen my interest piqued drinking lavender soda sounded like a wonderfully unique experience as i typically enjoy the scent of lavender soaps however i would soon learn that drinking a flower flavored soda would not be the exciting experience i had hoped it would be when i took my first sip i thought to myself what have i gotten myself into this time the initial flavor tasted like club soda that had been poured into a glass that contained soap residue from a previous cleaning interesting i thought perhaps the flavor is just subtle at first however as my drinking experience continued i came to realize that this would not be the case after i swallowed the soda i was faced with an aftertaste that rather than tasting like soap residue tasted simply like soap like a bar of soap was in my mouth this brought back horrible memories of my childhood you see when i was but a young boy my mother would always threaten to wash my mouth out with soap if i either said a bad word or said something disrespectful to her or my father being one to always question my mother s conviction i often found myself with a bar of soap in my mouth this had a tremendous lasting psychological effect as even twenty years later i can still taste the flavor of soap in my mouth when i consider saying a bad word consequently when i took my first taste of lavender soda i was hit with a flood of emotions i felt as though i had said a bad word or broken a rule i felt as though i was being punished for something but could not recall what i had done my vision began to become cloudy i began to lose control of my small motor functions i was soon reduced to a bluthering mess on the floor after being bombarded with such deeply buried memories i vowed never again to sip of such a soda as long as i shall live lest i suffer another episode such as the one described above in summary this soda tastes more like lavender scented soap than it does soda it might be better suited for a more delicate palate than my own but i personally do not prefer it 
positive,7/1/21,not sure if it works but taste is good like a caramel first got it in china town desided to buy again
positive,17/4/21,i used to live in baton rouge louisiana and learned from my relatives to brew and enjoy community coffee preparing it in my little white porcelain beggin just like my grandmother and aunts i make my own blend of coffee beans and was so pleased to see that amazon was now selling community coffee it is as good as i remember if being particularly since i like a very strong rich flavor i am now using their sumatran french roast expresso and columbian to make my blends and am very happy with the results so are my relatives and friends who ask to use my blends themselves great coffee from the land of strong coffee lovers i am moving on to chicory laced coffee now as community carries it personally i like this brand much better than other louisiana coffees 
positive,10/3/21,i love this tea it is so refreshing i drink it regularly and was able to buy it on subscribe and save through amazon so making the price very affordable 
positive,14/1/21,over the years this chili powder has gotten harder to find it has been a staple of our family s chili for decades and i am very glad to be able to still purchase it it has a perfect blend of seasonings that requires nothing more than ground beef onions and tomato soup to make an outstanding bowl of chili williams chili seasoning bulk mix oz 
positive,24/5/21,i was unaware this is not a factory sealed product that is the only con i would have about this product it is high quality tastes great and a great value i will purchase again 
positive,14/10/21,this is a close match to sugar and is supposed to be better for you than other artificial sweeteners a little expensive 
positive,7/2/21,my daughter cannot get enough of these delicious snacks and i have a pretty hard time telling her no since they are made of nothing but pure organic pureed fruits the packaging is fantastic to toss into your bag for on the go too all the flavors are great and if you want to try them before committing to a bulk amount starbucks now carries the line in store 
positive,29/3/21,this organic baby food is very tasty but has a very thin consistency my son has to drink it it is also very sweet nice as a desert but not for a meal for my month old 
positive,17/4/21,this tea tastes fantastic the flavour is not bitter at all as with other green teas and i keep brewing the same leaves about times a day and still get really excellent flavour the packaging was also great as it came in a sealable pouch that kept the leavs fresh will definitely continue to purchase this tea in the future 
positive,10/3/21,it is always a matter of choice on what types of food you enjoy and this product is one of those that i love you will not miss the taste of hotdogs anymore with this product and forget about the calorie and meat content this is the bomb in grilling 
positive,10/7/21,i received the chicken pill pockets for my cat and he loves them what an idea the order was fast and the price was fantastic this is where i will order them from now on thank you sooo much 
positive,27/1/21,hot from the toaster add a scoop of ice cream i like chocolate drizzle with some hot fudge sauce and a dollop of whipped cream ooooo it is too good not just a toaster pastry anymore 
positive,1/6/21,i was a bit skeptical on ordering a spirulina bar it is soooo green i must say it is one of my favorites to eat before going to the gym not grainy nor too sweet it gives me just enough energy to work hard without exhaustion the small size is just right so no need to save half for another time it is an excellent edition to a raw diet 
positive,20/8/21,this cake was super easy to make it tasted great and had an absolutly awesome texture the mouth feel of the cake is nothing like most microwaved treats even people who regularly eat wheat would be very surprised this is a wheat free and microwave product give the taste and texture the texture is very soft and light and not at all grainy the cake tastes like a cinnamon donut in terms of degree of sweetness and the cinnnamon flavor is very authentic and high quality tasting the cake delivers a completely authentic cake experience but you should know it is not supper pretty to look at and does not come with any topping as might be suggested by the label art if you are giving it as a special treat to someone as a birthday cake for instance you might want to spread some gluten free icing or whipped cream cheese on it to improve the aesthetic effect this would be a great purchase to keep in the pantry as an emergency treat or to keep at work as a courtesy maybe if you are doing a birthday and it turns out someone is on a gluten free diet really what this kit is perfect for is when you are at a motel with a microwave to send with a child going on a sleepover at someone else s house or to leave with grandparents as an easy treat to give gluten free grandchildren 
positive,14/8/21,i was a little nervous about this product when it was first introduced to me at a support group meeting i was not sure how any gf product cooked in the microwave could be edible but it was delicious i now try to keep some on hand for when traveling so i have a food option when the rest of the family is taking advantage of the hotel breakfast since almost everywhere has a microwave they will let me use 
positive,21/4/21,what is better than caffeine and sugar this product blends great coffee sugar and cream to produce a little cup of paradise 
positive,1/4/21,to see all the one star reviews is quite surprising mixed with water this stuff tastes great i am not sure what some reviewers are expecting but it does taste like a good glass of kool aid who does not like kool aid anyway it is main source that will keep you alert is the green tea extract which is pretty much caffeine but it is a smooth transition somehow not like drinking coffee or soda anyway not bad at all if you need a little pick me up got lots of vitamins in there too 
positive,17/4/21,really good i like it and i would drink this before or after a workout or run my son who runs also thought it was really good my other son did not like it too much i can taste the pomegranate the son that liked it gave it double thumbs up i think it is light enough for an every day drink before working out it has lots of vitamins and good stuff for you not so sure about that but i am sure it tastes good 
positive,10/3/21,i am new to green tea but i wanted to give these a shot after i got my senseo machine i was pleasently surprised with the taste it is very smooth with a light taste of lemon these are not made for the senseo machine but they work just as well 
positive,22/4/21,excellent and with a hint of lemon connoisseurs will like these small sardines tightly packed like sardines of course in pure olive oil 
positive,25/4/21,i love these k cups they have a nice tea taste they are cheaper than other places i love them cold too 
positive,1/4/21,this tea tastes even better with some milk and honey by itself it is better than average 
positive,30/6/21,wow this stuff tastes great it has a variety of uses and i am sure i will continue to find more 
positive,1/3/21,these are very flavorful fruit snacks my kids and i prefer them to others that have many more unhealthy ingredients they are pricey but anything that says organic tends to be 
positive,29/1/21,these cherries arrived promptly taste great and were completely as advertised we broke the package down into smaller quantities and froze them would buy again and will when the need arises 
positive,17/4/21,these are very good and a bargain depending on whether they are on sale came packed well i do not taste the oil that other reviewers mentioned a great snack or addition to salads 
positive,10/3/21,i was a little concerned about ordering such a large quantity but the price was good and the reviews were good i am happy that i did buy the cherries so good for snacking and adding to yogurt and on cereal i have not used them yet in baking but plan to make some muffins with adding the cherries to the batter taste for me is the right balance between tart and sweet after opening i put the cerries in zip lock bags and placed them in the refrigerator the cherries are fresh 
positive,30/5/21,these are really tasty and not too sweet we ordered another box great in oatmeal they are somewhat oily but this is not a problem just a surprise compared to something like raisins 
positive,28/9/21,it is my regular cereal now cinnamon is a strong spice so yes it dominates too sweet based on the amount of carbs in a serving its higher than some by two or three grams but with the amount of fiber including four grams of soluble the net carbs is reduced only knock here i wish it was available through the auto delivery service as this price appears to be way too high its about in the local store for one box 
positive,6/5/21,my dog loves them and we received them very quickly i highly recommend this product especially to owners with dogs who love to chew 
positive,20/4/21,these are good chips i like the texture and that they are easier to chew than regular tortilla chips especially good with some salsa 
positive,20/4/21,these chips are a family favorite i have a large family and we all love them similar to a healthy version of doritos a little more texture and great taste highly recommended 
positive,21/4/21,i love them they go really well with soups salads etc i just wish that they do not come broken up so much 
positive,2/5/21,this is just another in a long line of terrific yogi teas i usually keep a teapot full of this tea and add it to my orange juice based smoothie in the morning it adds a nice hint of mint i recently read that adding a citrus juice to green tea multiplies the benefits of the antioxidants in the tea this tea goes very well with orange juice 
positive,18/12/19,this is truly a great versatile mix substituting oil for butter and rice milk for regular milk works out perfect using orange juice for the milk makes great pancakes and muffins as well the options are endless for muffins our favorite is adding a bit of cinnamon and gfcf chocolate chips i also sneak in small amounts of light colored pureed veggies baby food 
negative,19/1/20,it is a joke that they market this as basmati rice since it is not even vaguely similar taste wise texmati will surely disappoint indian food lovers 
positive,19/1/20,i have tried alot of jasmine teas and by far this is the best i have tried everyone i share this with agrees 
positive,31/3/20,i have kids and we love this product even friends who come over request it it is really yummy 
positive,18/12/19,love the texture and lightness the flavor has a hint of nuts although does not have listed my family loves them 
positive,13/10/19,these are tasty great strawberry flavor nice and crisp and only calories i buy these on the subscription plan to save even more money i even ship these to my daughters 
positive,28/9/20,these bars are light and very tasty worth trying and i think you will like them even though i like them the price and small size of the bars will stop me from future purchases 
positive,16/11/20,my dog ace loves these treats i love them because i can throw a handful in my pocket to take along on one of ace s walks without them staining or making my pocket sticky the coating on the treats is great for those of us that do not want to bother with plastic baggies my dog learned most of his tricks using these treats as a reward 
positive,27/2/20,as my box arrived earlier today i cannot attest to it is health benefits i am not sure if i would be able to anyway but i can absolutely confirm that there is no taste 
positive,26/2/21,i was not expecting much from this a disposable package of self boiling pasta with a bag of meat sauce there should be no way it can work but it does you fill cover the slightly oily pasta with water leave on the drainer top microwave it for minutes drain it heat the sauce and mix it all up and amazingly it tasted good normally i cannot stand this zero effort lazy style of cooking microwaved meals but this was actually really tasty i would not make this a part of my regular routine because of the price but i can imagine people who would i have to take issue with the packaging though i am giving this four stars because each serving is individually packaged and none of it is recycleable the bulk of what you are buying is packaging and it all gets thrown away 
positive,18/12/19,i am a fan of healthy choice products and this one is good too i have generally used their frozen food options but liked the idea of a shelf storable healthy option for lunch this pack contains everything needed for a quick and healthy pasta lunch the directions are clear and easy to follow the straining device that drains excess water after microwaving the pasta works well and the pasta sauce packet contains a sufficient amount of sauce for the pasta this mixer takes a little more time and effort that a frozen option due to having the microwave the pasta drain it and add the sauce however the trade off of more time for preparation is outweighed by having an option that can be stored on a shelf or in a desk drawer a nice option for work or on the go 
positive,19/1/20,my family loves maple syrup on pancakes and by far this is one of the best we have tasted we love it 
negative,13/9/20,i have had martinis with fresh bleu cheese stuffed olives in the past and these are tasteless in comparison i could not distinguish the taste of bleu cheese take the time and stuff your pitted olives with fresh bleu cheese or find another already prepared brand 
positive,10/7/20,if you like graham crackers and you like oats and honey then you will love this product just the right amount of each makes this a real treat to eat i only wish it had less sodium mg apart from that the lack of trans fat and saturated fat makes this a healthy choice for graham cracker lovers i would buy this whole grain product again 
positive,14/4/21,i ate the graham crackers and they were delicious i shared the graham crackers with lana and she said also that the graham crackers were delicious both lana and i agreed on the strong oats taste and a lingering graham cracker taste less subtle than other graham crackers i asked lana if this was a cracker she would use for the crust of a banana cream or key lime pie with no hesitation she said yes this is a wonderful alternative snack to cookies and chips lana is with me in highly recommending back to nature golden honey oat grahams 
positive,24/4/21,these are some very tasty and sweet crackers they are a bit hard not overly processed like some of the big brand crackers you find in the grocery store they are very tasty and and make a great snack i have not had a chance to make smoores with them but i suspect they will be great for that too they are well formed and do not crumble apart easily so they are very versatile 
positive,28/4/21,these are very good premium graham crackers delicious what else can i say it is as good as a graham cracker can get which is to say good but not that great they are a bit pricey about more than a regular graham cracker is it worth it who knows how much do you love graham crackers if you love graham crackers or have lots of money to burn sure go for it 
positive,12/7/21,these graham crackers are everything you would want and expect of an all natural graham cracker they taste great with and fit right in with our family who go through a box a graham crackers on any given week these were not quite as tough as our usual brand of grahams with a few more broken crackers and they definitely do not stay fresh up as on the counter if you forget to seal up the zip lock i think both of these are a result of the lack of random binders and preservatives from other brands and i do not think they really detract from the product at all they are great crackers and worth the space in the pantry 
positive,18/12/19,i liked these a lot they had just a touch of sweetness not too much and are a great afternoon or late night snack i was pleasantly surprised that something that is supposed to be good for you tastes this good the only reason i gave them four stars instead of five was because the packaging left something to be desired it was hard to open the inside package without throwing crackers everywhere and they do not seal back up for freshness i put mine in a ziplock bag though and they stayed fresh that way try them you will like them 
positive,19/1/20,these crackers are delicious and healthy my month old daughter eats them equally as well as the popular graham cracker brand i will definitely buy these again 
positive,28/4/21,for being a natural and relatively healthy food item i am impressed by how good these crackers actually taste they are not as sweet as a standard graham cracker but again very good for what they are i top them with natural peanut butter and eat them with a glass of milk yum 
positive,8/8/20,i purchased this when it was about for the pack found the deal on great deal do not think it is worth over however pretty expensive at it is normal price this was my first time trying this brand probably one of the best instant soup products i have tasted this is not loaded with salts like most others and it taste healthy my only gripe is the amount of plastic and waste caused by this product here is the ingredients nutritional info if anyone is wondering ingredients noodles wheat flour water tapioca starch vegan lactic acid salt soup soybean paste water soybean rice salt sugar rice wine sea vegetable yeast extract onion shiitake mushroom toppings dehydrated tofu dehydrated green onion dehydrated spinach allergy note labeled as being processed on equipment that may contain traces of peanuts nutritional information serving size bowl calories carbohydrates fat sodium sugars fiber lt protein vitamin a vitamin c calcium iron 
positive,22/5/21,we tend to eat these straight and or with hummus as a chip substitute i have noticed some variation between packages in the texture of the crisps i prefer them when they are a bit firmer but they are still nice even when they are softer than i would like 
positive,18/12/19,i love these tasty snacks they have a great crunch and just the right amount of salt i am not sure i would call these a health food because of the fat content but they are really good tasting and i will be ordering again 
positive,19/1/20,these are great i am not a huge fan of vegetables but i will snack on these 
positive,3/8/20,this is an awesome tasting snack the cheapest place near us is trader joe s and they sell it for amazon is even cheaper you cannot just eat one we finish the whole bag each time we open it 
positive,29/7/21,great love these and happy that can be found on line would love if you carry the snak size bags because i open a bag i tend to eat all and the snak bags are better for portion control 
positive,8/7/20,i really like virginia diner unsalted peanuts so i decided to give this flavor a try the name old bay refers to the seasoning of the same name normally associated with seafood so if you are familiar with that seasoning you have an idea what to expect it is nothing like a bay leaf if you have ever had nabisco s doo dads snack mix then these peanuts will be familiar to you they taste almost just like the peanuts in the mix and if you wanted to make your own chex party mix these nuts would be perfect like all virginia diner products the nuts come with a foil seal which is tightly depressed because the contents are vacuum packed when you break the seal you will hear the air rush in this type of packaging helps insure the nuts are fresh and crunchy and they were the nuts are small and mostly in halves there are a few fragments but not many 
positive,13/4/21,i have always loved mochi but cannot find it in little rock and did not want to go through the trouble of making my own this arrived quickly and in good condition it tastes fresh and soft not stale at all if you like mochi you will not be dissapointed 
positive,20/2/21,very delicious taste was stars ingredients why i dropped one star added sugar but still i would recommend this product 
positive,9/12/20,i debated a while before ordering these because they are kind of fragile but my shipment had no problems ha maybe i would trust amazon and ups more than the people they have got working down at the grocery store another reason i debated ordering was of course the salt and of course being saltines there is a bunch of it i have not compared a lot of other snacks but strangely enough these have less salt that other alternatives i guess because there is no other tastes that they have to mask the little bit of salt the do have comes right on through i do not normally worry about such things as health and nutrition but boxes is a lot and i tend to chow down on a lot of them because they are so good plenty of time left on the expiration date months from now so that is not a worry prices as with everything fluctuate but i got a good deal 
positive,1/4/21,i love this cereal i first had it at my sisters and now i am hooked i love the fact that it has good grains and that it is organic so this seems a good cereal as cereals go i love the taste a little sweet and crunch and the price at a box is really good 
positive,25/2/21,this is a pleasantly vanilla tinged breakfast cereal organic and gluten free at about per box it may not be for everyone but for those who need to worry about gluten this cereal is definitely not a trade off on taste i like the texture too with a satisfying crunchiness that is filling i definitely recommend giving this a try 
positive,18/12/19,i tried nature s path crunchy vanilla sunrise courtesy of amazon vine and really enjoyed it there is lot of variety in the cereal with all sorts of granola and cereal type pieces i am not skilled enough at forensic cerealogy to identify all of them but i do know enough to say that they all tasted great this is a great breakfast treat and it even works as a snack if you are so inclined 
positive,19/1/20,i had problems with the order but i am writing this review just about the coffee we buy this coffee so that every friday at work i can make a special pot of flavor my co workers really seem to enjoy the fun flavors of this brand especially the chocolate ones we will continue to purchase this brand in the future 
positive,14/10/20,my teenagers who are very hard to please simply love this stuff will order again and again 
positive,10/3/21,for those who love herring you will not find a better product i remember eating kippers as a child and loving them grocery stores have a limited selection and higher prices these are much better than i remembered absolutely fantastic and good for you inexpensive source of omega and the fish are renewable i am so glad i found them here 
positive,15/8/21,my daughter started eating these while she was and loved them they melt really fast in your mouth and they taste very good its not sweet but its not tasteless it has a very creamy milk texture to it 
positive,27/4/21,awsome taste love the bold flavor and individual packging already drank them all will order them again and again rich taste wife loves the coffee
positive,24/1/21,if you like sugar and tropical fruit these snacks are for you they are small chunks with lots of flavor and they taste great my kids love them and i have purchased them many times also good on cereal sugar gets a bad rap i recomend it for good health 
positive,14/7/20,i recieved this in timely manner was packed good the taste is very good if you taste it at all no smoking if gets a little too hot i liked the smaller bottles so does nt get old before using all of it thanks
positive,5/6/21,welches has the best flavor it spreads very easy onto bread because its jam not jelly my daughter eats it everyday it is very good
positive,9/7/21,we use this with chicken tofu works well with everything we have tried great on romaine lettuce an addition to thai noodle soups
positive,5/6/21,even though the price is always fluctuating it is always been less than i would pay at a grocery store even when that store has a sale in my opinion de cecco makes the best pastas on the market today and penne is my favorite because it is versatile working well in many dishes and because it is easier to make sure it stays al dente i do not think i have ever cooked it so long that it went to mush though i suppose if you really tried you could do it for many years i fell back on spaghetti noodles but then switched to penne never to look back i even use it for a less conventional noodles salad with mayo with a touch of milk stirred in and shredded sharp cheddar cheese and a dusting of fresh or canned parsley or basil thrown in with the subscribe and save ordering you can save another and you will always have this stable on your pantry shelves 
positive,25/7/21,i found this stuff at a big box retailer not too long ago and gave it a try i was happy to find it here at a better price than the individual serving at the store it is a great drink to grab as i am running to catch my carpool in the morning it tides me over until i eat breakfast at work i love chocolate coconut water and this is great because of the caffeine kick of the coffee 
positive,13/7/21,all the wylers singles to go are great they taste good and mix easily in bottled water most places are overcharging for this item walgreen s sells a package of for or less it was a package of over memorial day most of my boxes had printing on the box indicating per box i see some places charging over per box at that rate you can buy a ounce can of soda even big brands when they are on special and you get the can and the water included so why spend that much just for the powder 
positive,9/7/21,i tried this for the first time and i loved it nice bold taste smooth the price was excellent considering what i have been paying elsewhere i intend to purchase this again if it is still available and would recommend it to people who prefer strong bold taste 
positive,8/7/21,i eat lentils at least once a week if not more and these are the best i have ever had typically i just buy the pound bag of goya or store brand lentils which are serviceable but every once in a while i will order these from amazon they really have much more taste than the generic pound bag of lentils they take longer to cook but are definitely worth it highly recommended
positive,15/7/21,as will all of bob s red mill products these are excellent the cost in buying in bulk from amazon is much lower than the cost at our local coop and i like this produce better does not really require any soaking before cooking 
positive,6/7/21,well i am neither british nor british born but i absolutely love marmite it is an acquired taste and one that produces very strong reactions indeed their love it or hate it ad says it all in fact as a proof of this i have two dogs one loves marmite sandwiches the other one starts sneezing when she feels the smell of it my recipe for the perfect breakfast marmite soldiers and soft boiled egg delicious 
positive,13/8/21,twinings seem to have discontinued their apple cinnamon flavor this tea is very similar it is more apple than cinnamon flavored but neither flavor is overwhelming it has a nice fruity tang to it without being acidic 
positive,5/6/21,i do not normally write reviews i cannot be bothered the reason for this review is this pasta is fantastic i have ms and it was recomended to me to do a gluten free diet i am italian and pasta is important to italians i now enjoy pasta as before this pasta tastes like regular pasta i have recomended it to my friends that are on gluten free diets and they love it also try it you will never regret it 
positive,9/7/21,my wife needs to eat gf we discovered this pasta brand and it has been great my and year old boys enjoy it as much as my wife does you can barley taste the difference between this pasta and the regular kind a must buy if you must eat gf note b c of the expense for gf pasta this brand typically i make two pasta bowls this brand for my wife and the non gf for the three of us with the exception of baked ziti and lazania 
positive,17/6/21,although a bit too sweet i like the texture and the amount of choclately goodness in each bite i do wish the brownie was a bit larger but i like the automatic portion control and the fact that they make a convenient snack for work or school usually amazon has great prices on food items but in this case they are half the price at your local costco where i was told by an associate there that they fly off the shelf 
positive,31/8/21,i was a little bit hesitant to order this many boxes of potato dumplings without knowing the brand it turns out that the taste and texture is very similar to the brand names excellent for an off brand the price is too high but altogether a great product for those who miss their knoedel on the plate next to the roast and gravy 
positive,7/8/21,i bought this stuff to take camping to use in recipes and in coffee teas i spent two weeks in the woods and was really glad i bought this item it works great and as far as i know there is nothing weird in it unlike most powdered coffee creamers it does take a little longer to completely mix in but it is way better note that this is not a milk substitute it is a superb cream replacement 
positive,6/9/21,i really like this jerky the plain jane is really good but so is the ginger flavor i am eyeballing the el diablo right now ah yes the hot stuff my favorite this jerky is not dry like some its moist without being heavy so its a great deal as far as price per pound 
positive,5/6/21,we had an easters party and i purchase this product to fill my pinata the kids was surprised and happy with the candy s 
positive,9/7/21,these nuts are the best great large size bag for partys really the best nuts i have ever eaten highly reccommend 
positive,19/6/21,does not mix well by hand but my sweet wife has a hand held electric shake mixer to do the job she uses cup less than recommended per gallon and it still taste rich and great she also uses it to make yogurt and it works great at this also so far the ss price has been steady not risen for the past or months that we have been receiving it thanks amazon and thanks mr bob 
positive,5/9/21,mixing takes a few minutes but time worth spent tastes great definately superior to fresh skim non fat milk love it 
positive,10/10/21,this is my new addiction the best white chocolate sauce there is i have a standing monthly order now i can enjoy my favorite white chocolate iced coffee everyday instead of once or twice a week 
positive,29/9/21,i just got my coffee the other day it taste as good as it sounds i love it would recommend all to try it 
positive,11/9/21,this is one of my fav flavors so far do not let the word cream fool you there is very little cream to these but they are still very flavorfull i add either french vanilla powdered cream or liquid cream to this and it is great i have it on a regular basis the flavor does not get old or eventually give you an aftertaste 
negative,5/6/21,i never met a piece of chocolate i did not like but this has an aftertaste i do not like i do like all the other if creamers i ordered but this 
negative,9/7/21,i have ordered several davidson s tea and they have all been exception except this order of decaf green tea tasted like rotten tea maybe i just got a bad bag 
positive,26/8/21,this is good stuff nice to have for afternoon coffee break sweet enough that you feel like you are having a treat but it is not a doughnut really very good 
positive,26/7/21,carnation is the best instant breakfast it not only tastes great but it mixes easily and completely in the milk 
positive,11/9/21,with the exception of home made these are my favorite egg noodles they always cook up just right firm and tasty i got them on an amazon warehouse deal so the price was better than getting them at a warehouse club and far better than the grocery store these are the medium ones which are pretty narrow in size good for adding to soups casseroles or just tossing with some butter and veggies came well packed with no discernable breakage in the packages 
positive,11/9/21,i buy this tea for my british mother in law she loves it world market never seems to have it in stock i order it online and treated like a king 
positive,15/9/21,excellent tasting green tea for those who want to quit black tea or coffee i quit coffee cold turkey by substituting this tea i was up to ounces of coffee a day now i drink ounces of this tea daily three cups yes i feel a lot better i have no desire for coffee anymore but i do dabble with black tea no longer do i have to trust others to serve me fresh coffee tea is always fresh and you can carry a few envelopes of your favorite variety just add hot water 
positive,5/6/21,this is the next best thing to homemade chicken broth i have used this product to make soups risotto and heighten the taste of gravy you may want to use a bit less water than is called for in the instructions
positive,9/7/21,i love flavored coffee and folgers is great amazon has better prices then you can get at the store 
positive,14/9/21,the whole family loves these crackers i like that they are not very salty my kids love them we eat both the bunnies and goldfish and they have never mentioned that they can tell the difference

positive,10/7/21,we run a catering and events company and use these mosty for childrens parties they are easy to serve and the children love the boyardee products we cannot get them from any supplier for what amazon sells them for in the subscribe save program and they taste good as well 
positive,1/3/20,i ordered these because i needed a flat sucker to put a round sticker on for a shower favor i had no idea what they tasted like but they turned to be really good actually i recieved exactly broken suckers in the whole pack of i did not think that was bad at all for such a fragile product 
positive,28/7/20,am a carb watcher and even though these do not a lot of fiber find a couple of them satisfying to have with a salad or just a quick snack like the fact that they are a whole wheat product
positive,28/7/20,i really enjoy these rice cakes i put them in the toaster and toast them and put butter and jam on them and they are just as good as eating toast for breakfast 
positive,10/11/19,great taste good price always looking for some flavor to add to my tea muixture this works better than most of the ones i have tried
positive,1/3/20,dr smoothie crushed fruit is great tasting and easy to make up with other foods that you like i like the fact that it only contains fruit and no other chemicals or additives since i am allergic to a lot of food 
positive,3/8/19,this vanilla biscotti flavor is one of my favorite coffees great flavor is truly the epitome of curling up with a good book by the fire kind of coffee folgers does a great job on their gourment coffees 
positive,6/2/21,the maple almond butter is incredible one of the best tasting foods i have ever had it is much better in the oz pouches as you can simply eat it plain i started putting it on bagels and toast but the flavor of the butter gets masked by the food it is on my kids love it easy to put in lunches not to mention it is very healthy and organic 
positive,24/2/21,i received this bonomo turkish taffy assorted flavors it was tasty not too sweet but perfect flavors too i shared mine with my family my son he really liked it kept asking for more and i also took some to my parents house my brother and his family were there too that day so are my sister and her family they all ate some and liked it too told me where i bought it my son and my daughter told them amazon she is at their website every day looking what amazon has new stuff so she can grab some and share with everyone they were looking at me with their smile on their face so they said amazon website is your second home you are there all the time i said sure i do not want to miss a great deals 
positive,13/5/21,this snack tastes really good i cannot help myself eating it up although it is small in size but i will difinitily purchase this again
positive,1/3/20,make it hot then enjoy it as hot tea or add ice cubes for iced tea the varied flavors give you an opportunity to try out different flavors celestial knows how to make good tea 
positive,28/7/20,despite what others are saying about these teas they are delicious it is the perfect amount of sweetness the peach ones are my favorite the flavor is not too strong but you can definitely taste it a lot healthier than drinking a flavored iced tea with diabetes amounts of sugar 
negative,13/5/20,some are better then others but overall they mostly taste like they have been chemically treated i will not puchase this in the future 
positive,26/3/21,left a review for a bird feeder on this product accidentally sorry for any confusion great product by the way really enjoy the oz packs to take into work 
positive,29/8/19,this chili is pretty tasty but only a little spicy it is easy to take with you there are two good size servings per container each serving is calories with grams of fat grams of carbs and grams of protein i have only eaten it as is but i think it would be great on nachos or chili dogs 
positive,7/2/21,my fiance and i both really love this one i am a salt fiend bought the low sodium version because it is cheaper and i did not even feel a need to add any i really loved it healthy easy and tasty you need to make sure you make it correctly though i boil water in a kettle then add the seasoning and a little water stir it really thoroughly then i add the rest of the water to the line and cover it with the spoon wait min or so and then stir again before eating perfect 
positive,14/10/21,the nuts were fresh and very tasty i bought them for baking but also ended up toasting them just to snack on 
negative,7/8/20,this was a gift and the recipient disliked the product basically a waste of money as the remaining cartons were never opened 
positive,1/3/20,tastes great and powder disolves with no problem i no longer drink soda of any kind or caffeine just wish the powder was easier to find and more green would be great if they sold it in tubs with a scoop 
positive,28/7/20,this is a tasty g f product i have been on a g f diet for years so have tried a lot of different products and this is one i reorder my only negative would be that it does not reheat well but that is true of most g f pastas not a problem if more than one person is eating it nice to have some thing quick and easy to make that is still a hot meal and g f 
positive,14/9/21,i am skeptical about the health claims of these cookies that said i eat them because they are crunchy and rich and delicious without being too high in calories the chocolate ones are my favorite these are really good 
positive,17/12/20,i found these at bj s wholesale club and really liked the taste they are very crunchy and chocolaty and the portion size is good 
positive,2/5/20,description lightly roasted and lightly salted with no added oil size bags evaluation excellent and flavorful however some are under roasted and not crunchy a few nuts taste stale blue diamond brand almonds moderately roasted with canola safflower or sunflower oil and lightly salted are more flavorful although not oily the roasting oil does effect the flavor whether that is a good thing or not is a matter of individual tastes the longer or more intense roasting makes the nuts crunchier price comparison at the time of this writing both back to nature and blue diamond almonds are about cents oz blue diamond almonds roasted salted ounce tins pack of the blue diamond almonds come in more convenient oz cans but may be less environmental freindly 
positive,14/7/21,i search for this candy everywhere candy stores no luck i got them as a christmas gift for my boyfriend he loved it
positive,18/7/19,this sunflower tastes really great very original flavor not over salted and the size of a sunflower seed is decent though not very large overall it is the best sunflower seed that i ever eat in america 
positive,1/3/20,i was introduced to this product by my cousin quick and easy way to give some added flavor to your rice based meal many different ways to prepare but my favorite is to marinate the meat in a slow cooker for the day then add to my rice in the rice cooker tasty wife was a bit put off by the pink color at first but the flavor pulled her past that looking forward to tryiong it in differnt ways 
positive,28/7/20,quite good i would definitely order this again nice sized roe a little soft meaning not a lot of pop but still quite good for the price 
positive,13/6/20,i prefer the saucettes but as they appear to be no longer available i tried these and have come to enjoy them just as much these have a little better flavor but the saucettes had a better texture these taste much better than meat 
positive,10/3/20,good stuff it has a better more natural flavor than the kraft version in my opinion 
positive,9/5/20,you will either like this double salted licorice and indeed other salted licorice available on amazon or you will detest it the reviews on this and other licorice products attest to this polarity among reviewers it is an acquired taste that once acquired proves to be somewhat addictive i have only recently become acquainted with salted licorice i actually prefer the normal salted variety although the salty kick from ammonium salts rather that sodium chloride is very strong and strangely satisfying in these double salt rounds i would advise anybody who is thinking of trying salted licorice to seek out a small pack of the stuff first of all if you like it go ahead and order one of the regular salted kraepelien holm farm salt licorice pound bags pack of available on amazon making sure to take advantage of the subscription offer otherwise you risk wasting your money on something you may consider inedible 
positive,14/5/19,was looking for a brand other than sense and came across baronet could not be more pleased great flavor rich and tasty each and every time will reorder again that is for sure 
positive,19/10/20,the sticky rice is perfect just microwave it in the container it comes in for min the paper thin wraps are very small and it is a bit difficult to roll the result is a bit of a mess but tastes great i put a small amount of crab meat next to the rice each pack comes with wraps a container of rice and one soy sauce pack the calorie count is but with it is a reasonable and is enough for a lunch i bought it when it was a gold box item for it is worth that but i will not purchase again for a higher price overall it is easy to make tastes great and is a great option to have around since it does not require any refrigeration 
positive,1/3/20,i was hesitant to purchase this despite the outstanding reviews because of the price i mean what could be cheaper than rice and toasted seaweed with that perspective i was very pleased with these meals snacks the rice was more delicious than the freshly made white rice served in many places possibly even better than the rice in my house and the wraps are super delicate and with a nice lightly crispy texture that is most enjoyable if you like sushi wraps and rice i highly recommend you try these 
positive,28/7/20,these soda s taste great while i have never had the original flavored i expect it to taste something like a sprite unlike american soda s like coke and dr pepper these are fruit flavored and have far less sugar and sodium in them making them a much healthier choice of beverage as healthy as a soda could possibly be that is all flavors taste great and the bottle is recyclable i would recommend them to anyone 
positive,7/3/20,looking for a delicious crunchy snack that will not go straight to your waistline these paper thin beautifully seasoned crackers hold up perfectly on their own and to any all of your favorite toppings hummus cheese hard and spreadable vegetable wafers cucumbers zucchini roasted peppers etc chip dips salsa i could go on forever at calories for crackers calories from fat these wonderful wafers will satisfy any snack attack and you will feel great about eating them i initially found these in a health food store but amazon sells and ships them for cheaper money quality was as good or better well that is what i think oh and yum 
positive,4/8/20,love crispix but do not like to have to go to the store often so i try online food shopping and for some items this is the way to go cheaper than regular price at the store for this large size of box
positive,26/12/19,i recently found out about these products and i love this breakfast sausages i have tried the other product cedar lake tasty link oz cans case of vegan they both taste good but i like these better healthy yet tasty 
positive,28/3/21,these little links are great very healthy and delicious great shelf stable non meat protein source i am not even a vegetarian and i prefer the taste of these over meat sausages 
positive,6/2/20,i was skeptical when i first purchased this because i got it pretty cheap and i am used to buying pretty pricey stuff at the store but it is actually pretty good i will definately keep on purchasing this saves me quite a bit of money also stays very fresh when kept in the freezer
positive,25/4/21,i love the taste of total and it is good for you even my kids love it 
positive,3/8/20,fresh and good for you swift shipment highly recommended i have been using this product for over a year now 
positive,15/4/19,my first taste of goji berries very good generous package will buy again the breakout food of the year even though they have been used for centuries by chinese cooks buddist cooks also use goji berries listed in dr pericone s secrets to beauty i am so glad to have learned about this super food 
positive,9/3/18,my daughters favorite food is pears and she also loves her green vegetables now both of them combined is the perfect combination and they are the perfect size my favorite part about this product is that it is organic a great taste that your baby will love and organic and safe which parents will love it is also an easy on the go food for your baby if you have multiple places to go i had no problem rating this product stars 
positive,18/5/18,although this is not marketed as a diet product the fact that it is portion controlled makes it an excellent snack for anyone watching their weight each bag is less than calories and there is a lot of crunching satisfaction and great taste with this fruit 
positive,9/3/18,this agave seriously has the best flavor i have used several different brands of agave and they all have a weird aftertaste but not xagave it makes it so much easier to incorporate it into my recipes 
positive,27/2/18,it is a wonderful snack and an immune system booster also i am so happy i found this and i recommended it to all my friends 
positive,20/2/18,my vet recommended these for my half siamese very particular cat because she kept having tarter buildup and as a result bad breath i was skeptical because my cat is very picky about food she loves them it is her treat each day well my vet stopped carrying them so i came to amazon and now i never have to worry about quick delivery tarter buildup bad breath or an unhappy kitty life is great with cet enzematic cat chews 
positive,22/3/18,this wildrice mix tasted just a mite too hard after cooking but if you left it for very long it got mooshy so the timing is critical once the timing is down the rice comes out perfect no more then minutes and has pure natural non chemical taste very wholesome and the blend is a nice mix of flavor 
positive,12/3/18,i have found this to be a good sweetener i have to use more than they say about drops when i am using lemon but i use extra packet sweetener too very happy i will just have to figure out how many servings i get from a bottle but i am guessing it is more economical than the stevia products i get at the grocery store 
negative,9/2/18,it does sweeten but there is an aftertaste when used in coffee or tea that is made with a weak taste 
negative,7/12/17,i purchased two types of stevia to try to move from using artificial sweetener to stevia i read recommendations for this product so i decided we would try it this really has a strong aftertaste of alcohol and chemicals i was disappointed because we had two bottles of the stuff my bad i threw it out because no one would eat the food that it touched fyi i prefer the stevita stevia supreme because there is no aftertaste with it i wish it was in liquid form too because that would be helpful 
positive,24/5/19,i must say this product exceeded my expectation i had the powder one before and it left a bitter after taste i was very pleased with the liquid and have ordered on more in a different flavor 
positive,9/3/18,love the fact you can make as much or as little as you need you do not have to open the can and waste the can they taste just a good as coming out of a can 
positive,18/5/18,i never liked the taste of the refried beans in a can i tried these and they were just as good as the kind you get in a mexican food restaurant melt some cheese on top i just ordered two of the cases of each 
positive,23/3/18,i originally bought these to help get my husband s cholesterol down this is another method to get in oatmeal without having to make a hot cereal i even pack them as a quick breakfast on the go the chocolate brownie and cranberry are our favorite varieties 
positive,8/9/20,i am really thrilled with this product i wanted to be able to make oatmeal in my slow cooker so that it was warm and ready in the morning with no hassles i have done so in the past with old fashioned rolled oats and the outcome was always less than satisfactory no matter what adjustments i made to the water oats ratio this attempt turned out perfectly the very first time which most likely has to do with the cut of the grain the ratio is cup oats to cups water on low for hours and cup of dried fruit i added about cup of quinoa and a total of cups dried fruit craisins tart cherries and goji berries and good sized diced braeburn apple no sugars i did not use the spray pam product it tells you to put in the crock but coated it with organic coconut oil which is solid at room temperature it was amazing no sweetening needed to enhance the flavors my husband eats oatmeal every day and he really liked it too 
positive,23/2/18,had the pleasure of trying outerbridge s sherry pepper sauce in a fish chowder delicious have since used it for stews and other soups and as a marinade adds just the right amount of kick with loads of flavor their steak sauce and soy sauce are also devine a little flavor of the island right here in my house 
positive,18/7/20,perfect bachelor food quick and easy really tasty compared to top ramen noodles you can tell the seasoning is extremely sodium laden 
positive,14/6/18,we did the shopping season for christmas they indicated that the product would arrive by january to our surprise came before christmas in excellent condition thoroughly recommended 
positive,2/11/18,i was pleasantly surprised when i tasted these cookies they are individually wrapped so they stay fresh they are sweet enough but not over sweet they are not overpowering everyone who has tried them agrees with this analysis we had sweet amaretti cookies in italy this summer and these can stand up to those so mangia 
positive,14/10/18,i bought this because of the pumpkin seeds and thought oh it is organic and hippy food it is going to be awful however it is amazing full of flavor and fruits and nuts it is a hearty cereal that leaves you feeling good 
positive,6/4/20,the soup really tastes great it is so convenient to throw one in your purse to take for lunch etc and it was a great buy 
positive,9/3/18,had never tasted these before buying them on amazon did my research and amazon had the best price now that i have tasted it i have to say it is delicious and made our bbq an even bigger hit will continue to buy this brand 
positive,18/5/18,this mincemeat pie filling is vegan and has great taste just put into prepared pie and bake make a small pie you need jars for a large pie great fore the holiday treats 
positive,7/3/18,i really thought efs was an excelent product that gives me the extra push to make it through long rides compared to accelerade it is better however more expensive as an amature rider i am not sure that it is worth the extra cost 
positive,24/1/19,it is what i wanted loaded with tender dried fruit and nuts i will order again 
positive,27/2/19,i really enjoy it is not my favorite colombian coffee but is really closer to the no suddenly the price has been going up so much
negative,19/4/20,i am a chinese student it smells like fruit but it does not have any taste when you take a sip does not taste a little bit like tea 
positive,17/4/20,i give foldgers a big yeah for this great tasting columbian coffee it is as good as dunking donuts and much better than starbucks it is just the right blend for breakfast love it foldgers i will continue to buy this coffee until i find something tastier 
positive,3/4/20,this is a very tasty products i love the crunch and the favor it gets four thumbs up from me
positive,7/8/19,i always taste the food i am about to introduce to my kid this one has a fresh berry taste a bit too runny though liquid smoothie baby loves it too especially when it shoots up as a fountain when he squeezes it problem is that its price increased drastically lately i am having a hard time justifying buying it instead of other no less tasty products 
positive,9/3/18,in the past i just did not use tomato paste very often that is because most brands are just nasty we would always have a can of hunt s or contadina around but i would always be disappointed whenever i used them it is really annoying to say make homemade enchilada sauce have it taste mediocre and then add insult to injury by having to throw away half a can of leftover tomato paste amore by contrast actually keeps the bright tomato flavor since it is in tubes there is none of the tinny taste so common to canned foods and it is so easy to squeeze out a small amount that i use it all the time there are all sorts of soups and sauces that can benefit from a little tomato flavor but which do not justify opening a whole can of paste not to mention the fact that most canned pastes would make the food taste worse not better there are only two mysteries about this product for me first a tablespoon serving has grams of fat no other tomato pastes i looked at contain fat since the ingredients are only tomato paste and salt i have to wonder where this fat comes from the second mystery is that they label the box as double concentrated as far as i can tell it is no more concentrated than any other tomato paste i still have to use exactly the same amount in a recipe it just tastes better than the other brands but i will forgive amore the mysterious fat and exaggerated labeling this has become a cooking essential in my kitchen 
positive,18/5/18,i recently began using wholesome sweeteners products and could not be happier with the taste i was so happy to discover this product and will continue using it for sure 
positive,27/1/19,tastes just like regular black tea only a little weaker do not get it if you expect it to actually taste like raspberries i bought boxes to use in the first half of my menstrual cycle for building a good uterine lining it is organic good tasting and has health benefits without the caffeine cannot go wrong 
positive,10/11/19,i bought this tea to help my pregnancy i think it may be helping i am hoping but it does taste very good i like it and would buy it again and recommend this product to friends 
positive,8/11/19,i really like black tea and this is a great taste substitute while pregnant i had to brew it stronger than recommended but it is great 
positive,25/10/21,bought this food after reading others reviews for my schnauzer who suffers from pancreatitis it really did the trick for him since being on this food he has not had one day of trouble a great food 
positive,8/5/20,i have been eating medifast meals for a year medifast changed the recipe to their pretzels and they were not as good to my surprise the cinnamon pretzel that kay s is a good if not better than medifast and cost have the price the calories and protein were important factor and are pretty much the same based on ounces 
positive,28/9/18,this is my husband s favorite soda has a mild fruity flavor similar to manzanita sol tastes like a little bit of heaven i cannot find any stores in my area that sell it but i have had good experiences buying it off amazon just remember when you are buying to pay attention to the shipping weight as some of the distributors use a mass picture of a pack but will actually be selling a litre shipping weight for a pack should be around oh and guarana comes in many flavors but guarana antarctica is usually the most popular favorite 
positive,29/7/19,i thought this a nice evenly tasting coffee with no bitterness or after taste i enjoy it and will buy more in the future 
positive,9/3/18,this has perfect balance of sweetness nutrients its a great breakfast item i love it i will but it again from amazon com
positive,18/5/18,this was handy when i could not get to a store and wanted some for the coming week day it was here not bad price but looking for better price but this was good stuff 
positive,17/5/20,most of the reviews are mostly negative but if your brand new to this candy its sooo delicious if you like a chewy hardness feeling like your jaw is going to fall off this is the stuff i am and never heard of this candy before but i tried it once at a world market and could not stop eating them there so addicting they have a great mouth watering taste to them i would recommend this candy to new comers 
negative,26/3/20,i usually drink the regular caffe d vita but i am on a low carb diet with no sugar so i thought i would try the sugar free i could not find it in the stores so i bought a six pack can through the internet it has absolutly no taste now i am stuck with six cans of sugar free caffe d vita and do not know what to do with them i would not buy this product again 
positive,24/2/20,it is a tasty tea handy packets to keep at work local store stopped carrying it and the amazon case is a decent price 
positive,3/5/19,quick shipping well packed i loved these they were for a party everyone enjoyed them true melon flavor not sticky really good thank you 
positive,27/3/20,for some reason our local stores stopped stocking this product my wife and i love the taste we used amonzon com to provide it excellent taste 
positive,31/12/20,previous reviews have been negative on the taste of this water but to me it has less taste than some common brands dasani aquafina of water in that sense i like it more i cannot stand the slightly bitter metallic taste of those waters this one tastes more like water on the other hand this is advertised for having the correct ph level and as being electrolyte infused but i have noticed nothing special about it in terms of how it impacts my workouts it is wet just like any other water so in this facet i rate it as being less than advertised 
positive,13/1/20,has a smooth taste like it claims without any unpleasant metallic flavor hydrates well although i think it is rather expensive and i personally did not notice it hydrating any better than arrowhead water which is what i normally drink if however you have already discovered that high ph water helps you more than other types this water tastes good and would be a good choice 
positive,21/9/20,a certainly refreshing bottle of water and a very large one at that the taste is very pleasing without the plastic from the bottle taste to taint it it seems a bit pricey though giving you extra benefits might just be worth the purchase 
positive,2/12/20,this water taste great we love the bottle perfect water for everyone i love that it is liters because i am trying to drink more water you will love this water 
positive,20/11/19,i am very picky about my water i moved to florida at the age of and i quickly realized that i could not drink the tap water i can actually taste the difference at restaurants when they serve tap water versus purified or bottled water essentia ph drinking water is the best water i have ever tasted it tastes completely clear and delicious i only received a liter bottle so i did not notice any of the medical benefits of the water i do have gerd but did not notice a difference with drinking the liters of water over days the price is a little steep on this water but i would consider buying more for the taste and to see if it really helps my gerd 
positive,2/12/20,i admit i have a hard time identifying differences in most bottled water unless they have some funky aftertaste but this water is different it tastes exceptionally clean and crisp no chemical tastes no salty taste just very refreshing water i like the large size of the bottles as carrying one of these as i go out would guarantee i meet my water quota for the day i poured some for my five year old granddaughter and she said you have good water at your house granny so i guess there is a difference when it is good it is good 
positive,11/12/19,i am not smart enough to know enough about bottled water i am in the camp who believes that naturally filtered well water is the best most bottled water strips the natural minerals out however there is somethign to be said about water being too acidic a higher ph would be the opposite so in that regard this should make this water much better honestly i cannot tell the difference but i can say ther was no odor there was no bad aftertaste but i cannot say if this is worth the price 
positive,20/11/19,this is one of the best tasting waters that i have tried it is just purified water and not spring water but it has such a pure tasting taste to it it is enhanced with minerals and honestly i can taste the mineral taste which i like funny that a good tasting water is different from most drinks that we consume water is one that we want without any taste or flavor just pure fresh wet and clean essentia is one without any noticeable flavors but the mineral taste i really liked it and gave it to my family too they were surprised with a yum which is not really a reaction that i normally get from water it has ph factor and infused with electrolytes cannot really tell those things from drinking it but good to know recommending completely on taste it is excellent tasting water 
positive,28/6/20,the first thing i look for in a water is the aftertaste some of them have a metallic nasty taste that i can not stand but this one is very refreshing cool clear and fresh definately would buy again 
positive,8/8/20,i think the essentia drinking water tastes very good there are a couple popular brands of bottled water that i think taste funny the essentia is very good and crisp i cannot say much about the actual ph level because i did not test it however i did not seem to have as many issues with my acid relux on the days when i drank the essentia it is awkward carrying the liter bottle around but i did actually find it helpful i take it to work in the morning and make myself drink it until it is gone before i allow myself to have something good meaning bad for me therefore i do get a much larger water intake during the day at the office than i normally would so i love the taste and the size of the bottle but it can get expensive i will probably keep some on hand especially when my acid reflux is really acting up and the prilosec is not helping but i am not sure if i could really afford to buy it to have every single day 
positive,14/7/21,tastes like good odorless fresh clean water i like the fact the water is electrolyte infused the bottle is a very generous size but easy to grip and hold 
positive,2/12/20,what else can i say other than this drinking water tastes great the bottle is quite large at liter it is almost the size of a liter bottle of soda 
positive,20/11/19,i am on auto and i love my water just wish it was a little bit cheaper or if they give discounts or free pack with orders it would make thing a bit easier i will continue to get my essentia as long as i am able to the water does have a lot of wonderful advantages i have fluid build up in my legs and sometimes my lungs because of my heart i had kidney failure this water has helped me to be well hydrated and to keep my kidneys in working order the water goes directly where it is needed 
positive,1/3/21,for me some bottle water is better than others this bottled water was very good it had a good clean taste which is always important especially for those who do not enjoy drinking water the bottle was also thick enough to withstand being dropped but not so thick that you are really just paying for the bottle overall i would buy this bottled water again 
positive,5/5/21,a little expensive considering its maxwell house but its better than starbucks fresh and i will buy again for cup person its ideal 
positive,2/12/20,our family loves these cornuts delicious fresh and crunchy we remember them from when we were kids and still cannot get enough we like all the flavors but our favorite is still the original after much research this company offers the best price 
positive,20/11/19,ordered this because of some minor stomach issues certainly has not hurt but not sure it has all the healing powers others claim but only time will tell a few things this honey tastes great just about like regular honey so do not be afraid to order it thinking you cannot handle the taste it has the consistency of a honey butter spread and is great right out of the jar or on toast bottom line probably more expensive than regular honey but if you have some digestive issues worth trying as it is a good tasting product 
positive,9/10/21,this is my first manuka honey and i must say that it tastes very nice toast a slice of bread e g arnold s ancient grains spread honey spread peanut butter enjoy 
negative,6/3/21,i was really looking forward to trying this on some toast but the tast was so bitter that it was hard to enjoy i really gave it an honest try but yuck the price is fair and the consistancy was good maybe it was just me i do not know 
positive,12/2/21,this is definitely different than any other raw honey i have tried and its fantastic with three small kids i cannot afford to be sick and a few spoonfuls of this stuff a day helps soothe a sore throat when i am dealing with an innless or scratchy throat from allergies and i could swear it also boosts my mood and energy it also seems to help digestive problems i started taking a tablespoon a day preventatively and was pleasantly surprised to be the only member of my family not laid low by a heinous stomach bug that swept through our home i also love that this stuff does not have to be chiseled out of the jar like some raw honey totally with the money and this is the cheapest place to get it that i have found my local whole foods charges almost double for the stuff 
positive,2/12/20,just tried this for the first time yesterday it could have fooled me that it was not coffee i think it actually tastes better than coffee the hazelnut flavor is great better for you and no caffiene reactions 
positive,20/11/19,for a serving of full flavored and nutritious split pea soap that involves only boiling and pouring water nothing can beat dr mcdougall s split pea soup with barley this is the best instant soup that is on the market 
positive,25/6/21,i have tried pretty much all flavors and it is great i take it for lunch daily it is quikly to preper it is under cal per meal you save a lot of money and time do not leaving the office to a restaurant to eat and is guilty free bcuz is vegan to me is a great solution for my lunch time on weekdays where i had daily look for a place to eat where i could get something vegetarian safe under and healthy you will see how much money you save do not eating at a restaurant bringing you own snaks and lunch from home 
positive,17/3/20,excellent price considering what the local coffe shop charges for chai this is the best chai tea mix i have ever tasted and the best value i have found 
negative,20/10/21,not worth buying tastes like alcohol no chocolate taste at all smells faintly of chocolate but not worth using i wanted to increase the chocolate flavor of my protein shakes without adding carbs this purchase was useless 
positive,21/7/20,my geriatric bouvier des flandres is years old and becoming increasingly finicky with his eating this product not only is palatable but has encouraged him to eat again it is also low in fat which is what he needs due to a history of pancreatitis 
positive,22/2/21,i use this syrup on pancakes and to make homemade granola it is great tasting with lots of maple flavor i love the spill resistant spout good value instead of going to the grocery store for pure maple syrup 
positive,8/6/21,this is a great product great taste and texture i will definitely purchase more 
positive,2/12/20,what can i say i just ordered another flavor from the same company every one in my office comments on the rich smell and having a cup in the morning is something i look forward to if you like flavored coffee you will like this one 
positive,20/11/19,for gluten free they are pretty good they are a bit dry but that seems to be a problem with gluten free in general i like the simplebites line but i wish there were more varieties 
positive,25/1/21,i wanted these for a crust for pumpkin cheesecake but they did not quite make it in time no matter we enjoyed them right out of the box they are packed full of flavor the big question as with all gf baked goods is texture these cookies are excellent very crunchy without being at all crumbly or sandy if you have ever enjoyed ppefferneuse these will take you there they are exactly like that right down to the possibility of a cracked tooth and that is not a negative it is part of the charm really they are good cookies with outstanding ginger flavor mom says these are every bit as good as the ppefferneuse she made for christmas every year and that is high praise 
positive,1/7/21,i love pamela s products and amazon is a great place to get a good prices i like these ginger snaps because they are not too gingery they are just right 
positive,30/9/20,this is the best pre packaged wasabi i have found it has a great texture too i only buy this now that a friend recommended it and i tried it wa
positive,15/3/20,i bought a case of these noodles and was impressed with the quality it is greenish in color and has a hint of spinach taste to it that i really liked it is hearty and fills you up in summary i really liked it and would buy it again 
positive,6/7/21,can you say sugar high lol that was the point in ordering a case i sent it to my husband who is deployed overseas he loves them 
negative,29/6/21,i love the regular version of this soup and accidentally bought a case of the low sodium version no amount of added salt improves the overwhelming blandness of this product 
positive,29/6/21,this tea has a nice flavor although it is hard to say if it is actually increasing my joint comfort the power of placebo can be just as powerful if not more so than any herb or medicine out there 
positive,26/7/21,i love horizon organic products and accidentally stumbled across these in starbucks i had a gift card and instead of leaving a just little on it i purchased a horizon organic chocolate milk along with my coffee i thought i better go straight home so i can put this in the fridge for later wrong i was so happy that they do not have to be refrigerated then i was even happier when i tasted it soooo good now when i have a chocolate craving after dinner i reach for one of these instead of a candy bar yes they are still calories but i feel better about having one of these than candy cookies or ice cream they are a bit expensive but with amazon s current sale and shopping around locally i have found them for an ok price i also emailed horizon organic and they are sending me coupons i do not know for how much off 
positive,21/10/21,i like the taste of this chocolate milk it is not too sweet and the size is perfect to take to work and have it as my breakfast new the design of this container is terrible for toddlers opening from the top fits the straw perfectly but this is bad when my daughter drinks it she would try really hard to suck on the straw when the air is gone and container is flat she would squeese it trying to get more milk 
positive,25/10/21,i have purchased these in the past from other websites and love them i was excited to find such a deal on the price per bag by purchasing the case through amazon although that is a lot of chips i ordered one plain and one spicy the plain were delicious and fresh the spicy were stale so now i have a case of stale chips and a case of fresh chips thus the gamble with ordering in quantity i suppose the chips themselves are wonderful nutty and a much healthier and lower carb higher fiber alternative to tortilla chips i eat them plain with salsa or make nachos with them we even crumble them over taco salad 
positive,29/6/21,this is a nutritious and tasty way to add seasoning to grains veggies etc that is not loaded with salt and other preservatives 
positive,5/7/21,these have a great taste and are very crispy just cheese so they are good if you are trying to go low carb or are gluten free the only problem i had was they are expensive 
positive,17/9/21,have not gotten a box of yogi tea i did not like and this one is no different it is more of an herbal infusion with green tea so it might not be as tea y as one might expect but if you are unsure if you want to commit to a whole case of the stuff i would buy a box at the store and test it out because a case is a huge price savings in my ct area of about about a box but it is an expensive loss if it turns out you do not like it hopeful for good results i am getting married in four months and am using this as a part of a healthier skin routine 
positive,18/8/21,i think these taste better than other non gluten cakes perhaps it is the ingredients you need to add to the mix cup butter softened cup buttermilk large eggs t vanilla and t almond extract you can make chocolate cake by adding cocoa to dry cake mix and increasing the buttermilk to cups one box makes two cakes or muffin cupcakes mix is cheaper here than at albertsons and whole foods hodgson mill batch tests using an elisa gluten assay test all natural gluten free ingredients that are both additive and preservative free

positive,24/6/21,really quenches your thirst but you need to like seltzer water i do top of the line 
positive,27/9/21,not exactly perfect for extreme low carb dieting but still good enough compared to your average sugar infused muffin mix flavor is pretty good though the muffins are lacking something to round them off but they are moist and have a good texture 
positive,29/6/21,immediately after placing my order i received an email from the seller with care instructions and specifics on the shipping of the bamboo when it arrived exactly when i was expecting it it was in superb shape i could tell not only by looking at it but also by the smell it was such a nice treat to open the package and be greeted with that fresh sweet smell not only was the quality of the bamboo superb but it was such a great price i would absolutely recommend this seller and their products 
negative,5/8/21,my girlfriend and i are regular drinkers of flavor pack enhanced water read hate plain water i saw ads for this on tv and figured i would give it a try i have to say we both hate the taste and it by far does not add nearly enough flavor to water no matter how much you put it i would not recommend this product at any price go with the classic powder flavor packs asin crystal light on the go fruit punch drink mix count boxes pack of 
positive,29/6/21,i have run into nonni s at the homes of various friends and never thought to try and get some for myself they are the perfect complement to my morning cup of coffee and give me a little pick me up without loading me up first thing in the morning delicious buy some 
negative,31/7/21,i do not think i am going to drink this anymore everytime i drink it i feel like i am on fear factor with an after workout powder like this i do not look forward to drinking it after a workout
positive,11/9/21,have never been a big meat eater but cut back even more a few months ago i began supplementing my diet with more beans legumes but was not feeling nutritionally satisfied and realized i was not getting enough protein did a little research and discovered that hemp was ideal for meeting protein requirements and according several articles i read it has many other nutritional and health benefits as well i purchased the nutiva hemp protein powder in conjunction with the better than milk rice to avoid over use of soy according to directions for both products i mix tablespoons hemp protein and tablespoons of btm in water it mixes easily in a regular plastic shaker and i do not even have to use the de clumping attachment that fits inside the shaker it is just shake n go this combination has been the perfect way to start my day i was concerned about the taste as some reviews i have read rated the taste of hemp very low i cannot speak for other brands but the finely ground nutiva hemp powder has a mild nutty flavor and i love it from what i have read hemp does not contain oligosaccharides which commonly causes gastric distress with soy proteins and i have not experienced any bloating with the hemp and rice milk combo i am happy to start my day with something both nutritious and delicious and thank goodness i do not have to use the electric blender one less thing to wash also the amazon price on the nutiva hemp protein and the better than milk rice cannot be beat and both qualify for free shipping fantastic 
positive,12/8/21,i did not expect this to taste very good i was surprised that it was great i will be ordering this item in the future it also arrived very quickly 
positive,31/7/20,a fantastic buy totally worth it i am done itch buying tose little packages you are just paying of packaging there this yeast is fantastic i e put it in a plastic container after i opened it and leave it the refrigerator also whenever a recipe calls for instant yeast i just add more yeast to the recipe and it turns out perfect 
positive,13/6/20,this tea tastes wonderful by itself with a little honey or stevia if you are counting calories or carbs for a real treat mix it with a little peppermint tea bigelow makes a morroccan mint that is really great for this particular mix but it is not available on amazon yet 
positive,31/7/20,bigelows only red tea so far is pear the flavor is excellent no caffeine and its organic the pear flavor is light and does not taste artificial because its not i have about red teas that i drink regularly because it so low in tannins and does not aggravate my illness bigelows asian pear is one of my favorites 
positive,13/6/20,the taste reminds me of maple syrup it is very tasty when used in cereal or on pancakes but it is also a perfect sweetener for my tea and it does not change the flavor of my tea when i use it i do not use honey nor do i like the taste and this does not taste anything like honey to me 
positive,26/9/20,i do not eat stuff like this very often but when i am in the mood it is nice to know i have an alternative that is not quite as bad as the original it is handy enough to throw in my purse and take to the movie theater and a much better option than the popcorn there i would not recommend making a steady diet of the stuff after all it is essentially all refined carbs but for that occasional treat this would certainly be a better choice than other alternatives and the taste is fantastic 
positive,17/10/20,these are some awfully tasty donuts they consist of a fairly dense golden cake coated in chocolate they are small but rather dense and rich they are always moist probably because of some additive but it is the additives that make them tasty this is something i can only stand to eat every so often but on occasion they are really delicious 
positive,14/12/20,i like this hot cocoa mix a lot the taste is better than what you usually get at the office or grocery store which should not come as a surprise for a ghirardelli product it is a bit expensive but it is worth it in my view 
positive,29/5/20,found this to be an excellent product for making cherry limeades to flavoring yogurt have made this one of my pantry staples 
positive,9/12/20,as i have stated before i love cheery flavor so this was awesome and my sweetheart liked it too you can add as much water to it to suit your own taste 
positive,4/8/20,this is very good i am taking it because i have some gout at the tips of my toes and i exercise intensely every day so i want to protect my joints it is part of my daily health regiment it is got a good taste but the directions say take two tablespoons for a oz glass seems too diluted for me so i put tablespoons to a glass seems to taste better i have not tried taking just a tablespoon straight yet 
positive,31/7/20,these bars kick fruit butt they really are one of the best breakfast bars that i have ever tasted plus they appear to be somewhat healthy which is always good i can eat one of these for breakfast and be satisfied

positive,21/11/20,my year old loves this product it is a nice little variety pack i am going to subscribe for every months best hot chocolate k cups made 
positive,25/5/21,i was honestly a little afraid to try this tea because it gets so many mixed reviews in general and especially after reading about pu erh s fermentation process but i am so glad that i did not let all of that discourage me this is a very smooth rich full bodied tea that satisfies someone like me who drinks lots of bold dark coffee it definitely has a very earthy taste that is very invigorating any time of the day i used to think that black tea was my favorite but that has definitely changed what makes this specific brand better as well is the fact that the seller is extremely fast at shipping the item 
positive,25/5/21,read some reviews that said this tea could taste strong and earthy but generation pu erh tea was surprisingly nice much nicer than green tea i am very happy with this product and the service was exceptional shipping incredibly fast thanks

positive,8/2/21,i drink a lot of tea i probably drink around cups a day and i drink the good stuff all whole leaf quality loose tea so i know a good cup of tea when i see one these are the only bottles of tea that are of fantastic quality ito en makes amazing stuff and this is my absolute favorite tea from them the price is excellent and the drink is so healthy i have it delivered once a month every month highly recommended 
positive,10/2/21,these are a great alternative to high calorie snacks great with salsa or any type of dip also great as a side with soup 
positive,9/10/20,product came quickly and in great condition they taste great the bags are larger than the little snack bags of chips i usually get i am very pleased 
positive,31/7/20,when ever possible i try to buy the duncan hines angel food cake mix as it is the best tasting box cake mix on the grocery shelf some of the other angel food cake mixes may have a slightly funky after taste the duncan hines brand does not the cake mix is easy to prepare and bakes up tall and light highly recommend note i like the two step version of this cake mix but it is no longer made 
positive,13/6/20,i had been buying the store brand for years but skippy reminded me why it is okay to spend the extra few cents to have better taste 
positive,5/12/20,this is really nice to have when you just want something a little different it makes drinking a cup of coffee step out of the ordinary 
positive,1/11/20,this is very tasty jerky but i am laughin at the spicy part i had no idea it was supposed to have some heat to it until i read the package a little more carefully really it is not hot spicy at all to me but does taste good the pack i ate was filled with lots of smaller pieces and only a few slices i did not find it overly dry just kind of moist and chewy great high protein snack for low carbers and anyone else less than gram of carb per serving calories per serving and servings per bag but you will probably eat the whole bag because it is not that much enjoy 
positive,14/1/21,these seeds taste very good they arrived much quicker than i had anticipated i especially enjoy these seeds sprinkled on top of soup instead of crackers i am trying to cut back on the amount of grains i consume 
positive,6/6/21,i do not generally care too much for the healthy alternatives especially when it comes to coffee however after trying truvia at a hotel i am now hooked i usually get it at the grocery store but it is good to see that it is available on amazon and now that i have prime i might just be getting it online instead this sweetener tastes really good and in addition to coffee i have had it with desserts and it tastes great i think it even tastes better than sugar and definitely tastes better than splenda i cannot comment as to the health aspects related to artificial sweeteners but i am sure that there is plenty of information available on the internet related to that as a casual coffee drinker i highly recommend truvia however you may be better off purchasing a larger box or count instead of this pack of six unless you just really like the size of the count boxes but if you have never tried it definitely purchase a smaller box to try it out first 
positive,21/7/20,i ordered this as i had been missing ramen noodles since i became vegetarian i wanted something that was tasty and yet healthy these noodles are so much better than i had expected i would highly recommend 
positive,5/1/21,my daughter loves these in fact she loves any type of annie s bunny crackers they are definitely a healthier option for snack crackers 
positive,23/1/21,got some of this on sale at the local grocery store today was impressed with the taste the energy boost is not much different from other products to me however the taste is something i would actually drink as a regular drink impressive since many energy drinks are foul tasting 
positive,31/7/20,my wife drinks about cups of these a day and loves them we always have enough on the shelf and they do not go bad no caffeine so she sleeps like a baby 
positive,13/6/20,whenever people eat roasted veggies at my house they ask what i use to season vegetables olde thompson callifornia garlic sea salt is a favorite the grinder is excellent it gives any dish that extra zing never tastes salty just better try it you will love it 
positive,1/12/20,good earth is a great tasting decaf white tea which is more healthy even than green tea it is very hard to find in health food or regular food stores so glad to know it is available through amazon 
positive,30/1/21,makes a lovely gift the flavor is is intoxicating and can be used for spicing up any kind of dish 
positive,1/1/21,these takis have a great taste to them tried them about weeks ago and now i love them the taste is great they are very spicy and hot but they are also very good the crunchy lime hot taste they have is just one of the best 
positive,11/1/21,full of pulp which my daughter loves i only wish they came in glass and not a can 
positive,31/7/20,they crumble easily and i can use water from my coffee pot minus the coffee of course and the variety of flavors it a win sure the calories are a bit high but you can work that off in no time the good quick easy and flavorful the bad the calories overall i will keep buying them while deployed
negative,13/6/20,i received this produce pretty fast the packaging is really cute but the tea is tasteless it is a mint tea but i cannot taste the mint at all disappointed will not order again 
positive,14/1/21,great taste and convenience for quick addition of onions to recipes that include a lot of liquid at the beginning of the cooking cycle soups rice etc 
positive,7/12/20,i was tentative ordering kcups of this flavor but figured for it was worth a try i like these for my taste they are not too sweet and i definitely am glad i got them not too watery even at the oz setting all in all i like the flavor and am waiting for another deal a little kalua is not bad at night either 
positive,5/5/21,i really enjoyed this i bought it when it was on sale for for two boxes i do not drink but i think this would make an excellent cocktail with rum vodka or whiskey i will say though it is very rich i usually only drink a couple gulps i would like to try it with different syrups like maybe raspberry syrup or put ice cream in it 
positive,23/11/20,great product but boy did i waste money buying this from amazon it only cost in the local asian supermarket 
positive,29/8/20,my kids loved this tasty treat the apple pieces were a nice size and tasted like a fresh apple will be buying more of these in the future 
positive,18/1/21,this is a much better tasting instant tea than anything else lipton currently makes it is not as convenient coming in the big jar vs the individual packets but the taste is well worth it lightly sweet with just a hint of tea highly recommend 
positive,18/6/21,lipton raspberry instant mix is so easy to make just put a few spoons of the product in a glass of water and add ice it has such a light fruity taste that you feel good every time you take a drink try it when you come in the house after a hot time in the garden sooo good
positive,18/6/21,great taste for years i bought another lemon product cannot remember the name that i was very happy with then happened to come across this product and wow it was even better so buying it regularly for last couple of years use mostly in iced tea

negative,7/7/21,i have been a customer of right foods for almost years but the asian entrees do not do it for me they taste bitter and the seasoning is inconsistent 
positive,1/7/21,wow how do they pack all that sweetness and flavor into just a few drops i just tried it in my coffee and i was very surprised this is great stuff and such a blessing for the diabetics out there like myself 
negative,7/7/21,i love my hot chocolate but this one is very weak i have to add a little syrup to give it a more chocolate taste 
positive,23/7/21,i bought this with my hestitation however it tastes good it has a very butterly taste and sweet as well only pieces not so many 
positive,20/7/21,closest red mexican rice since a dinner in mexico i add two heaping tbsps of crumbled bacon and a can of ro tel original diced tomatoes and green chilies everyone from college students to a year old love it 
negative,19/7/21,these cookies are not sweet at all which is ok but they also have no flavor at all they name is vanilla creme cookies where is vanilla the texture is kind of strange too cookie is crumbly but around the creme it is crunchy overall will not be buying this product ever again 
positive,18/6/21,very cherry tasting reminds me of cherry popsicles with the addition of vitamins it is a great alternative to juices and sodas it is very dark red so be careful of stains
positive,7/7/21,these gummi vitamins taste great sweet and sour made with arctic cloudberries which are like yellow raspberries but not as sweet suitable for adults as well as kids 
positive,27/6/21,we bought these to make out xmas eve stuffed vinegar peppers everyone prefers red peppers but the usual jarred vinegar cherry tomatoes are mostly green i saw these and though expensive decided to buy them just for the holiday they are very tender and tasty our only complaints are that they are much smaller therefore a little difficult to stuff and pricey for taste i would give them stars 
positive,21/7/21,these lollipops have the best flavor ever i have tried many but these are definitely the very best they come in many flavors something for everone

positive,24/8/21,i have ordered these types of chocolates before weinbrand bohnen brandy chocolates and these were fantastic they had great flavor were very fresh sometimes they dry up if they are older and were the perfect size some larger ones are too big and the liquid can run if not all in your mouth the chocolate as well as the brandy were of high quality and very tasty also the price was great for as many that were in the package i ordered these very close to the holiday and they arrived earlier than expected 
positive,21/7/21,i love my tassimo coffee machine and i love the gevalia signature blend coffee it is great any time of day never bitter or over bearing always smooth and mild i have been using it for over years now and the coffee is brewed the same for every cup i highly recommend tassimo machine and gevalia signature blend coffee 
positive,25/6/21,this coffee has a rich flavor without any bitterness i usually do not like coffee made with dark beans because they are too strong for my taste but this coffee is great tasting i signed up for amazon s subscribe and save service and ordered just one oz bag to try it the discount and free shipping with the subscribe service makes it a great bargain too 
positive,13/9/21,bold and tangy the taco bell spicy ranchero sauce is excellent we have used it with tacos and with flautas and now there is none left in our sample bottle everyone liked it even those who normally do not care for spicy foods off to the grocery for more 
positive,18/6/21,this sauce is pretty good it is calories per tablespoon i tried this sauce with chicken and really liked it it is not too spicy at all i do not usually eat spicy food and am very sensitive to even small amounts of heat in my food this sauce hardly had any heat at all 
positive,7/7/21,the taste of this sauce is not anything earth shattering but it is good had it on my lunch turkey wraps for a few weeks and four dabs went a long way for flavor not spicy at all creamy and just the right zip to spice up something a tad without the hotness or watery consistency of salsa 
positive,15/7/21,this sauce has a unique and interesting flavor it makes a great salad dressing as well overall i recommend and like the fact there are are few ingredients enjoy 
positive,11/7/21,even though sugar free these candies taste as good as the sugared variety good mix of flavors in small packages 
positive,7/10/21,i bought sumac to make the fattouch salad i was making for authentic would not have been the same without it gives it a nice sweet flavor especially the dressing now i am looking for other ways to use it
positive,6/7/21,mycodex plus environmental control aerosol household spray is amazing the basement was full of fleas this year one can sprayed onto the basement floor took care of the problem other products have been tried as well as flea bombs having been set off nothing else seemed to work this stuff is a plus would definitely use again if ever there was a need 
positive,18/6/21,there is a lot of popcorn in this bag we have had this without butter and it tastes great i have never had popcorn that tastes this good great product 
positive,7/7/21,this popcorn has pretty fair flavor plain i always add buttery oil and salt to it because i am a fat fat i purchased this bag of popcorn months ago and i still have about pounds left next time i think i will get the pound bag and i will not have to worry about buying popcorn for the rest of my life you will save a ton of money by purchasing bulk bags of seeds and a popcorn popper i highly recommend this product along with the presto poplite hot air popper white for all popcorn lovers 
positive,27/7/21,this popcorn is very good its cheap but it does not taste like it very fluffy this is the perfect popcorn for people who do not want to spend bucks on bags of popcorn 
positive,13/7/21,some of my friends who i have offered these to say they taste like soap and even i have to admit they have a very unusual taste but that is what i love about them and they leave your breath smelling wonderful for a really long time afterwards i first purchased these at world market but here i got them at less than half of what they sell them for each there live on the edge try violet candy today i wish they also made them in lavendar flavor too 
positive,13/9/21,this is another in a series of good kashi cereals i have yet to have a bad one 
positive,7/9/21,we made this and it was light easy to make and great with chips and vegetables i purchased for neighbors and friends for the hollidays
positive,17/4/21,item was perfect they have a very good sweet cinnamon taste and they were not too hot i do not like spicy food for me i received them quickly and would re order again these are my favorite candies and it is very hard to locate in stores now 
positive,10/3/21,i purchased this on a whim after eating a butternut squash pasta dish at a very nice restaurant i am very leery of canned jarred pasta sauce and almost always prefer to just make my own from scratch however this sauce is just divine it has a very robust taste and is pleasantly sweet i paired it with cheese ravioli and it was just perfect i think that it would be great with just about any pasta it is a pleasant change from a tomato based sauce and is very satisfying i highly recommend 
positive,17/4/21,i have tried many types of chocolate drinks since i do not drink milk this one along with trader joe s chocolate soymilk are my favorites would give stars except that it is pretty expensive 
positive,21/1/21,a friend of mine has suggested leilalove french macaron to me it is realllllly awesome if you are a cookie lover it worth testing plus beautiful package and on time delivery 
positive,30/1/21,i first purchased this product at bj s wholesale club this is the best flavored carbonated water i have ever had like other reviewers bj s discontinued in favor of another product what a mistake i wrote to talking rain and their new president requesting this product have an online outlet and it seems they delivered yes it is more expensive but with super saver shipping and subscription service savings i am in for a few cases each month try it you will love it 
positive,13/2/21,i purchased this on a whim based on a co worker s comment about how much they like this brand it is not the best value at each on subscribe save but i was interested enough to give it a shot i am glad i did all three flavors were great and each time i picked one up i was saying this is definitely my favorite flavor but then i would say the same on the next one and let us just call it a vicious circle i did want to point out and why i deducted star the picture of the product listed shows pomegranate berry orange mango and black raspberry however the package that was received had lemon lime in place of pomegranate berry while it was a great flavor i was looking forward to trying the pomegranate berry i am hoping maybe my next shipment is what is shown on the picture 
positive,15/1/21,i liked the taste of these cookies and they reminded me of my childhood however these are packaged different they are sealed in a plastic wrapper not the wax type paper from a long time ago i am guessing that this keeps the graham crackers fresh tasting for a long time they were crispy and had a decent taste my only complaint was that several of the packages were damaged and the crackers were crumbs 
positive,6/3/21,these graham crackers are a lot better tasting than the organic graham crackers that i have tried and compared to other brands generic i much prefer the crunchy sweetness of honey maid the graham crackers taste so fresh and are the best for dunking in milk or tea i love these as an alternative to cookies fortunately the packaging ensures that the last graham cracker is as good and crispy as the first one the portable and palatable treats are great for kids or anyone on the go and for making perfectly shaped s mores 
positive,8/6/21,as far as cookies go this is not going to ruin your diet much and it is pretty tasty too three cookies and they are not tiny cookies either are calories there are of both fiber protein they are not too sweet which is great for me these are called cookies but they seem more like crackers they are kind of dry which i do not mind but the blueberries make them a little chewy the ingredients do not list sulfur dioxide a color preservative for many dried fruits yay sulfur gives me hives anyway as of right now these are per package for packages of servings each i am hoping these become subscribe save items these are good i will probably get them again 
positive,7/1/21,newtons fruit thins are quite delicious as soon as you bite into one of these crispy cookies you can taste the real blueberries right down to a few seeds but i did not specifically notice the brown sugar flavor they are just the right thickness to be crispy not hard the package contains a plastic tray with rows of cookies cookies in each row very enjoyable 
positive,17/4/21,these cookies were unexpectedly tasty and crispy given the fact that there was no hydrogenated fat in them i always look at the list of ingredients for the word hydrogenated even when the label says no trans fat they are not too sweet with a slight taste of blueberry and brown sugar i agree with other reviewers that they have an addictive quality to them and with only calories for three cookies about calories per cookie one could get into trouble by overindulging my husband and i really liked these however these would be perfect for dunking in milk or crumbling over ice cream enjoy 
positive,10/3/21,these cookies are not like the traditional fig newtons fruit newtonss i have bought in the past they look more like a thin cracker the cookies are also crunchy like a cracker but definitely not as dry they are sweet but not too sweet and very blueberry they remind me of the very top of a blueberry muffin which is a good thing i will definitely buy more of these for my family 
positive,14/1/21,it is incredibly tasty i would recommend that any hot spice lover give it a try i will attempt to give an objective description but well it is a spice you will really have to taste it yourself hotness mild or roughly like tabasco brand pepper sauce original red oz saltyness none it is just pepper absorption v high v finely ground unable to observe any small flecks after cooking into my standard spice test top ramen variety pack beef chicken it has a very clean smooth taste almost like adding pure hotness to food without the smoky overtone of tobasco the roughness of black pepper or the cumin of chili sauces it has a very slight cling or linger ie as with habanero peppers where the more you eat the hotter it gets one or two sips of water will wash it clean i have not tried it with mixed spiced and milder dishes but due to how easy it is to sip the hotness away it should work very well there 
positive,24/5/21,i like this flavor but it kind of reminds me a jello pudding bites and those things are just nasty i mostly use this one for recipes to create new flavors 
positive,14/10/21,i encountered this snack in a vending machine liked it and bought a case for travel i think it is very tasty stuff and reasonably healthy especially compared with other packaged snacks 
negative,7/2/21,the flavor of the two does not taste lie strawberries and vanilla in my opinion for being naturally flavored they do have a manufactured taste i tried one of each before giving the rest away 
positive,29/3/21,i have loved ultra thin pretzel sticks since mr salty used to sell them then for decades i never saw an other ultra thin pretzel sticks and did not even know if any were available anywhere then i saw them at a local department store and was ecstatic but then after going twice they discontinued them these are the ones that were at the department store i was disappointed but decided to give amazon com a shot and see if i could find them here and i did they even have a subscription plan where you can get a case every month months or months and the price for a case is reasonable especially if you go with the subscription at which time your shipping is always free just buying a case costs way too much with shipping i was not too thrilled with the idea of having to have a subscription just for free shipping but you can cancel at any time and i found that having a case on hand is nice and so we are getting them every months that gives us time to eat what we want share with our grown kids and grandkids and still give us time in between orders to not get sick of them it is great i highly recommend these especially if you love ultra thin pretzel sticks like i do 
negative,17/4/21,i was very disappointed i love good cider having grown up and gone to the mill each year i like most grocery store cider as well this stuff was really bad tasted to me like raw chemicals went through or people who spit it out directly not my machine they liked the tea and coffee and even ran hot water between to see if that was it 
negative,10/3/21,not nearly as good tasting as the other kcup ciders i have had my girlfriend hated it too they are going to find the garbage can 
positive,10/7/21,these k cups are a quick and tasty way to make a hot cup of cider i have tried several brands of k cup cider and this is by far the best the caramel flavor is also very good 
positive,27/1/21,taste much better than the regular apple cider i look forward to drinking a cup at night after work smells great too 
negative,1/6/21,i usually purchase the green mountain naturals apple cider i found this product was much cheaper and i would try it from now on i will spend the extra for a taste i enjoy this went down the sink

positive,25/5/21,i love these bears because their sweetness is a bit more subtle than the regular gummy bears i do not like things to be too sweet that does not mean these guys are lacking in flavour though just that they taste more like fruit and less like sugar they are chewier as well which is something else i love keeps me from eating too many at a time

positive,22/7/21,great tasting jerky while the family likes the more traditional jerky i really have come to enjoy this hormone free jerky the sodium level is so much lower than most jerky brands so not brutal salt like most jerky 
positive,22/6/21,i love this chai it is the best on the market i was sick of spending almost daily so i decided to make them at home instead best choice ever i use hot water and frothed milk sprinkle with cinnamon and it tastes like my favorite bakery chai also i highly recommend this seller i received the chai on the next business day extremely satisfied customer 
positive,28/7/21,this tub us expensive but when you think of the costs of this many fresh bananas it comes out less the taste is awesome as soon as you pop them into your mouth the flavor comes out they look a little funny dry but taste awesome my kids love junk food and when i bought these they going for handfuls instead of candy and did not stop until they were gone i did not even get a chance to bake with them 
positive,13/10/21,i enjoy these so much more than traditional fried banana chips they do really stick to your teeth a lot but it is as sweet as candy even without added sugar so i would not consider that a huge detriment i did not have a problem with stale or soggy fruit the bag was well sealed watch out it is easy to eat a lot of them

positive,26/3/21,i was brewing about pots a day of starbucks columbian or other good columbian coffees until recently at a relative that only had folgers instant i reluctantly tried it and was amazed at the great taste i could not believe how good it was and now i drink it everyday even more than brewed coffee i highly recommend trying this 
positive,24/3/21,this is my favorite flavor of crystal lite but i could not find it anywhere thankfully i could get a huge batch of it on amazon so it will last me quite a while thank you 
positive,24/2/21,this is probably the best tea i have had and this brand is always a winner so far i am still perfecting my taste with this particular tea but while i am experimenting looking for my perfect taste i have found it to be great weak or strong depending on my mood i like strong tea sometimes but not bitter which can be a problem for tea whether to much or to little is used my advice would be perfect before you rate because you may just be making it wrong since i usually let my tea set longer than what is recommended to get my taste and my taste is different than anyone in my family they usually claim it is too strong with how much i use but for me it is perfect this is a pack of six so make sure you will like this kind before purchasing 
positive,19/2/21,these light crunchy crackers are free of eggs dairy casein wheat gluten soy corn nuts peanuts sesame and coconut an allergen free dream and yummy 
positive,14/12/20,we use it as a coating for fish it comes out really great amazon has the best price

positive,14/12/20,i tried peach tea at a cracker barrel near me and loved it i found it here at amazon and bought my pack and have gone thru more than half in less than two months i love the taste and being instant can be made very easily for a quick drink i think i like this better then ice tea with lemon even and that is a favorite thanks for the good price amazon and quick shipping 
positive,1/6/21,like previous crystal light products this one is easy to use and mix and tastes great will plan on getting it again 
positive,1/4/21,i always have been of crystal light products so i thought i would give these a try these taste great and are so easy to make 
positive,15/4/21,the soup is very tasty i add flavor with dried parsley flakes celery seed and lots of pepper this is the second time i have received a shipment of campbells s healthy choice chicken noodle soup i am reluctant to order it again since almost every can was dented in the last batch that said i wish amazon carried the homestyle chicken noodle soup i like that better as the noodles are smaller and firmer 
positive,19/5/21,these are very good i love to munch on them for a crunchy snack and they dissolve quick enough for my month old to eat most of them 
positive,19/2/21,i am always looking for something to take to the office to have for lunch i enjoy items that are different and have flavor this item was a pleasant surprise there was just enough citrus flavor and spice to make this simple dish a nice treat for lunch i do wish the ingredients were listed before purchasing i am a vegetarian preferring to be vegan this item does contain milk if you are a vegan then this item is one to overlook i do recommend adding a little brocolli carrots peas or pea pods with this dish 
positive,14/12/20,the mixed veggie pack is better that is the only reason i gave this stars i am not a fan of edamame but cruncha ma me has made me one the mixed veggie pack even my kids eat 
positive,28/7/21,i have just gone through my first box of this beef jerky and it tastes really good my whole family likes it it is spicy but not unbearable the sweetness tend to balance out the spiciness the only problem i had with my first order was that one of the bags was moldy must be faulty packaging 
positive,29/6/21,very good to flavor broth i got this kind genmai because i cannot have gluten grains no reactions so far 
positive,15/10/21,this is the best instant coffee i have ever tried the aroma is rich and pure with a little caramelized flavor no sour muddy tastes i do not think it is pricey compare to other products and the quality i get absolutely worth every penny the best drink to wake you up every morning do not hesitate just try it 
positive,20/7/21,i have tried three brands of almond butter so far and find barney butter has the best flavor another had fewer ingredients and lower fat but i like bb best 
positive,12/10/21,the product was and is fantastic the people who made this possible by helping me be able to order this were absolutely fantastic 
positive,19/2/21,update was great at less than with subscribe and save now it is holy heck no way one of the few crunchy cookies that taste homemade so much better than chips ahoy you will completely forget about them no yucky after taste like chips ahoy plenty of chocolate chips made with real chocolate gasp i love the mini size perfect for putting a few in a condiment bowl and covering with milk my secret midnight snack every now and then of course comes in a huge oz bag that will last my family of for a month hence i set this up for monthly delivery and at their subscribe rate who can beat that 
positive,14/12/20,this protein powder is absolutely delicious it blends well with no clumps chunks or residue it has a wonderful taste that i recognize from smoothies i have had at real smoothie bars my homemade smoothies now taste like i bought them from a shop i only wish i had bought the oz bags instead of the oz bags will definitely correct that for next time 
positive,2/7/21,i originally purchased these to use as a fun gift for a secret sister and happened to be starving when they arrived in the mail today the crackers cheese spread and pepperoni were incredibly tasty the dried fruit complimented the trio well and the chocolate toffee was a perfect top off i immediately got online to order another variety to try it seems like a small meal but it has kept me full all afternoon i am going to package two in a gift basket along with a bottled drink and some napkins seems a napkin is the one thing the gopicnic folks forgot they will be perfect for an early fall afternoon in the park hope the other meals will make it to the gift wrapping stage 
negative,11/3/21,looking for a quick cook sticky toffee pudding these caught my eye the only thing that resembles a sticky toffee pudding from this product though is the name bland tasting a disappointment beyond words 
positive,10/4/21,one of the best i have tasted takes a bit longer to make but worth the effort 
positive,22/7/19,my son was nursed and then we found out he was allergic to cow s milk i could not get him to drink any other milk alternative he loves this product my only complaint is that it does not come in single serve sizes so when we travel i am constantly carrying around the big container in a cooler for day trips in the car this is fine but this stinks for airplane travel i have tried to serve him the single serve of rice milk but he simply will not drink as much as this he loves it 
positive,2/2/20,great taste and easy to carry with you for whenever you may want flavored water the taste is not overpowering or too bland i prefer this to just plain water 
positive,2/2/20,these cranberries are plump and taste great they have a nice aroma and just the right amount of sugar great 
positive,31/8/19,i am not a rice connoisseur and the roland thai jasmine rice is the first type of jasmine rice i have ever tasted to me this rice looks like basmati rice long and thin grains it cooks pretty well turns fluffy and fast in the microwave i add cups of water for every cup of rice and the cooked rice looks like cooked basmati rice the rice tastes good too although i have to say i prefer the taste of real basmati rice 
positive,22/7/19,these are my favorite dark chocolate i do not like overly sweet chocolates and love the combination of salt and dark chocolate these are very tasty and just the right size if you want to have a small daily dose of dark chocolate but do not want to load up on calories 
positive,12/1/20,we used to raise montmorency cherries and these dried cherries are the real deal as dried fruit they are perfect moist chewy and wonderfully flavorful they make a wonderfully energizing snack at the office though i generally do not like added sugar on dried fruits it is really necessary to counteract the cherries naturally tart taste reconstituted i am guessing they would be perfect for tart cherry pies certainly the flavor is everything i remember in a really good tart cherry pie which is almost impossible to find these days 
positive,19/2/20,in the great british trifecta of british powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar horlicks the most malty milo is medium chocolately and malty and ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately all are basically comfort drinks when plain milk just will not do all are powders to which you add milk and sugar to get a sweet malty drink the latter two with chocolate flavor as well i love all drinks but if you are drinking this for nostalgia s sake make sure you get the milo from where ever your nostalgia springs from because milo is made in different countries and they all taste a little different for me i love milo for it is good mix of chocolate and malt not too much of either and a great comfort drink for cold nights 
positive,27/11/19,i made pumpkin bread for the first time a few weeks ago with some fresh pumpkin my husband needs to eat gluten free so we tried this baking mix instead of wheat flour it was delicious we all thought it was so wonderful that we bought more pumpkins just so we can make more the only thing that i do not like is that it has a small amount of corn starch in the baking powder and my son is on a corn free diet 
positive,12/12/19,this meat is very fresh and taste very good its already cooked you just warm it up in the frying pan its sliced thin its lot better than the one at the restaurants
positive,26/9/20,i have had a hard time figuring out the right amount to use but this product tastes great it was shipped quickly packaged well 
positive,22/7/19,this adds a great taste to your popcorn its not easy to get the same measurement each time and removing it from the container provided is a bit of a task the price of this product is high and even higher depending on your location shipping costs are very high and are on the rise this product does not yield as much popped corn as some other products but it still is the best for taste gives a great flavor from the initial popping and not adding any toppings 
positive,2/2/20,if those dense heavy nutrition bars are too rich for you to tolerate or if you cannot handle them after a hard workout this one is worth trying it is very tasty and light the wafers give it a nice texture and crunch and it will remind you of those creme wafer cookies from childhood but much tastier and with better nutrition i will say that if you are looking for a super bar this may not be ideal because it does have a little more fat in it than other bars i like and a bit less protein and carbs but it is worth buying because it tastes really good it is light and easy to digest for me this is a great meal replacement bar snack or great after a light to moderate workout 
positive,23/5/20,i chose this product as i am not crazy about chocolate flavoured products this goes well with coffee and good if you are in a hurry it keeps me full till lunch time i worry about the fat content however i probably would need an input from a dietician regarding that 
positive,22/11/20,i really like all the power bars flavors great for when you want a snack but do not want all the bad stuff that comes with other protein bars i also like the crunch when i am craving chocolate it really hits the spot and dulls my cravings 
positive,30/3/20,i like this product because it basically does what i anticipated as long as you have a full glass of water with it it will keep you feeling full for a few hours 
positive,8/7/20,i have tried lots of different protein bars but the main problem is always the same they taste like protein bars this is my favorite because it tastes like eating a normal chocolate waffer candy bar chocolate is my favorite followed by peanut butter great for a snack i take one with me when i go out with friends so i have a tasty healthy treat 
positive,4/1/20,these energy bars taste great and come in a variety of flavors they are low in carbs which is what i need 
positive,30/1/21,seriously calories these are so good and even better if you add a little bit to them if you know what i mean 
positive,2/11/20,i have been trying all kinds of diet drinks because i am getting tired of just water all the time so many diet drinks have a strong after taste or no flavor at all i have always liked crystal light drinks but have been hoping for some new flavors these new moctails flavors are great they have a very different flavor from their other mixes the mojito flavor is refreshing and has a wonderful taste i definitely recommend you try all the moctails flavors you will not be dissapointed 
negative,17/10/20,this did not tickle my taste buds i really wanted to like it but will go back to the crystal light lemonade 
positive,22/7/19,i was pleasantly surprised at the new crystal light drink mixes the mojito flavor tastes a lot like the real thing there is a strong lime taste and sort of an after taste of a kick of mint this was my second favorite of the three varieties available but it was pretty tasty and a nice change of pace 
positive,2/2/20,i have not crystal light since it was still made with saccharin but i have been wanting to lose some weight and stop drinking so many sugary drinks but it is hard being most diet sodas end up giving me a headache anyway i went out on a limb and i tried it it was delicious you could hardly even taste the artificial sweetener and the flavor was yummy i do not drink alcohol so i have never had a real mojito but this had just the right amount of mint to add a little something to the lime i have tried a recipe from paula deen for a honeydew limeade with mint and it is one of the best drinks i have ever had but it is also loaded with sugar and with all the fruit it ends up costs bucks a pitcher so i usually only make it once or twice a summer but this has the same flavors of mint lime and a sweetness if only they added some honeydew but then it will not be a mojito i guess i will definitely be getting it again and it did not even give me a headache like diet soda does stars 
positive,4/10/20,i enjoy many other flavors of crystal light but i got bored of them all for a long time recently i bought a container of the mojito flavor and i am hooked great taste like a children s version of a mojito i drink a lot more water liquid each day because of these little packets great alternative to diet soft drinks and water 
positive,1/4/20,ideal is the right name for this low calorie yes sweetener absolutely no funky aftertaste acts just like sugar and tastes like it too 
positive,8/5/20,ok this salt is a must have if you really like to cook i think it has a good flavor and the price is really good even if you do not use it everyday it is good to add to your spices 
positive,18/6/20,the coffee is excellent easy to order and always arrives in a short period of time love the convienence and am about to enjoy a fresh cup this morning we used to have coffee made in a drip coffee pot but by the time we would have a second cup the coffee lost much of it is taste and at times tasted burnt never happens with keurig coffee 
positive,20/8/20,i take these for snacks sometimes just for lunch very filling can carry in your pocket with no mess love the flavor 
positive,1/6/21,these are great tasting bars i could eat them all day but the problem is that they are not filling at all you eat one and it does not feel like you ate anything at all which is why i have to give it stars instead of one 
positive,4/7/21,i purchased these bars as a meal replacement after a job during lunch the texture is a bit hard moat if not all protein bars are hard but these special k protein bars tastes great with grams of protein per bar it is a much better alternative then other snacks out there i only have other protein bars that i use as meal replacements after a workout or job and these special k bars tastes the best to me i will be buying more 
positive,5/2/20,i saw that star rating and thought there is no way the folks at buffalo bills could produce a beef stick rated one out of five i bought them because of that one star and i was right its a star snack just like everything else they sell it is much better than any common slim jim or jack links beef stick 
positive,22/7/19,i got a bag of this free at pax and was really surprised how good it was i mean gamers generally do not eat well but i like this better than most trail mix 
positive,2/2/20,this was great i was not expecting jam to taste this good i will never switch back the only reason i do not use it every day is because i do not want to run out of it 
positive,22/11/20,this stuff is delicious the flavor tastes like a combination of grape juice and cranberry juice it has just the right amounts of sweetness and tartness the size of each packet makes it perfect for adding to a bottle of spring water or a bottle of filtered water from home the little stix are very convenient and easy to open best of all it has no sugar no carbs and no calories a great way to jazz up your water without messing up your diet 
positive,1/3/20,there is a very nice watermelon flavor to these candies if i had any complaint and i really do not it would be that i would prefer the candies individually wrapped otherwise i am pleased with my selection 
positive,23/11/20,i eat this many times a week it is flavorful and great texture i would eat it even if i were not gluten free 
positive,5/4/21,great tasting and the added benefit is the fiber my son loves granola granola bars etc and with gf products it is really hard to find sources of fiber this is wonderful and it has fiber 
positive,27/4/20,i rarely find this product in the grocery store in my rural town so i decided to make the online purchase kraft honey hickory smoke barbecue sauce is a mild sweet sauce nothing fancy but i really like it 
positive,8/3/21,it is so hard to find gluten free foods that taste good this one is really delicious and it is easy to make 
positive,30/1/20,narnia i first had turkish delight while i was in turkey there shops produce turkish delight and hundreds of other exotic treats fresh every town of more than a few thousand people seems to have at least one of these shops the sweetness of turkish delight varies by shop in its native homeland and this confection is a fine example so long as one does not eat all that sugar sifting around in the box i think there is so much so it will act as a natural preservative if you cannot fit a quick trip turkey to get the genuine article hand made fresh then this is the best imported substitute i have tried i would not trust getting something like this from a regular retailer because of potential shelf life issues and i would not trust confections obtained from a discount clothing outlet but on line through amazon i trust tangentially if you like turkish delight you owe it to yourself to visit the country of origin because there is many other delicious turkish confections you probably have not experienced 
negative,22/7/19,would not recommend this product to anyone because it had chemical taste which my guests complained about when i served on a buffet type dinner i was so embarrassed 
positive,2/2/20,obviously taste is subjective i wanted to add my opinion and stars to the tally to this item because i believe it is worth it 
positive,2/9/20,wanted organic walnuts and now i have them convenient that they are in separate bags so i do not have to open at one time good tasting bits and halves 
positive,26/1/21,this is an excellent soy free alternative to peanut butter i even bake with it i make peanut butter cookies that people would swear are real peanut butter with this product it is definitely not a no stir product though it does arrive separated the oil tends to rise to the top and so it does need to be stirred from time to time this is still a fabulous product my children adore it 
positive,9/1/21,i agree with previous review these do not resemble scallops in any way but they are very good i do not understand why they are so hard to find recipe suggestion cook ramen noodles throw in a handful of chopped skallops when the noodles are almost cooked just long enough to heat them up drain most of the water then add the spice packet not very classy but good and quick 
positive,30/7/21,brewing this coffee took me back to my trip to kona and visiting the coffee plantations drinking a cup of this brew is the next best thing to being there 
positive,30/10/20,great strong tasting gum but does not last long but is still worth it especially if your not allowed to have regular sf gum the cinnamon taste is very great 
positive,3/8/20,although it is a bit alarming to have these given a star review by a cheesewhiz afficianado a condiment competing for most vile non food item on the supermarket shelf i am going to these actually are really fabulous they have a mealy texture and great oaty oily taste that is better than any other oat cake i have tried and better than any other cracker too my babies also love them and as non wheat products are suitable for the young and for the allergic 
positive,29/1/21,i love these crackers and keep them on hand all the time they are great for soups cheese and cracker snacks to spread peanut butter on just plain or they are like chips cannot eat just one i have them on subscribe save and they always arrive safely and on time a bit of trivia our parrots love them as snacks too 
positive,24/10/21,this pasta was very good i was a bit skeptical at first about the pre cooked pasta in a container that did not need to be refrigerated but i ate it and had no ill side effects the instructions to heat up the pasta and sauce were simple and because it is not a frozen meal it only took about in the microwave the pasta was cooked well the sauce while simple marinara was really good just enough seasoning to make it taste good without taking away from the great tomato taste the marinara was also chunky and not pureed or watery or runny overall a very good product that i would eat again 
negative,24/10/21,i think these peppercorns are bland tasteless it lacks the pepper spiciness will never buy this brand again it was a fail choice to say the least
positive,16/10/21,my japanese grandma drinks a homemade mix of apple cider vinegar and bananas for health and this drink is black pungent and quite frightening hongcho vinegreat is a great alternative and actually tastes really good do not let the vinegar scare you off it is really quite sweet and you just get a little hit of the tang going down i guess it really depends on how much you dilute it i believe the package says for a strong taste or or for a lighter taste i have tried both the pomegranate and blueberry flavors and they were both good you can also mix the concentrate with milk yogurt or even make a salad dressing out of it the bottle recommends drinking after a work out after a bath or before bed the purported benefits of drinking vinegar including overall well being improvement in digestion speeding up metabolism and skin benefits i have only been drinking this for a short time so i cannot really say if i have noticed any difference in health as far as the amazon price i got a smokin deal at my local h mart and picked up a bottle for only the regular price is bottle so the amazon price is not too bad especially if you do not have a korean grocery store nearby 
positive,24/10/21,tea has a great flavor besides a lot of health benefits it is mild tasting not strong at all here are a lot of bags in box so lasts a while 
positive,25/9/21,used these cones for a back to school ice cream social everyone thought they were great i would buy them again 
positive,19/10/21,i bought this for halloween treats ordered it on the and it came on the great service i like this candy bar better than the butterfinger bar which seems to fall apart when taking the bar out of the wrapper the chocolate seems to be a better grade in the clark bar 
positive,20/10/21,great coconut oil purchased this to use when making my own popcorn it is great my whole family loves the taste after buying this i read that virgin coconut oil is the most healthy for popcorn was thrilled to get it see that it is virgin coconut oil love it hope it comes in a larger container for next time 
positive,19/10/21,i have ordered this times now my son in afghanistan requested some of this to be sent to him he loves it it is a little salty but if you eat with low salt or no salt tortilla chips it tastes great you will love it 
positive,15/6/21,when you follow the cooking directions it is excellent if you do not cook it into the pasta the flavor is ruined
positive,4/8/21,if you compare to buying the packs at walmart its a great price of the packs from walmart are this is the flavor is the best i have ever had i like spearmint but then a friend gave me a piece of this and its way better
positive,4/8/21,i had never tried green tea powder before but decided to get some after reading some reviews on smoothies and healthy drinks since i make about to smoothies a week i thought this would be a great addition to my different recipes i was a little surprised at how small the can was when i received it i do not know why since it is only oz which is a fairly small size it is a bit pricey for the size but worth the money if you really enjoy green tea or use it as a health enhancer 
positive,18/7/21,i am not sure what else to say but it is a very tasty syrup it comes in a pretty standard bottle but it was packet very well and arrived in fine shape 
negative,18/10/21,this is fine it is just not all that perhaps if i had special equipment that would make it without getting little floaties in my cup i would have given it more stars i used a fine mesh strainer and poured the boiling water through twice and perhaps if i did not get an unimaginable headache a half hour or so after drinking it i might have gone for three stars unsure whether this caused the headache i have to try it one more time but the end result tasted like tea nothing special and at per bag uh i would rather go for celestial seasonings if i want some caffeine free tea beverage drink so if you have an espresso machine and want to branch out into tea this might be for you otherwise go for some loose leaf and steep the hell out of it 
positive,15/6/21,eden foods puts out the best tasting pumpkin seeds these are shelled she will removed these spicy ones do not have much more flavor than the regular ones but enough to make them worth getting instead of the regulars they are not hot at all oh and the best thing about these they are message free 
positive,4/8/21,i like anything by this company and wish more flavors available from amazon the apple cinnamon is very versatile and makes especially good iced tea also 
positive,8/6/21,can be eaten on its own not salty at all with each single serving porch 
positive,15/6/21,very tasty bacon smoky sauce for eggs hamburgers non bacony items that could use some bacon goodness hubby is thrilled not a spicy hot sauce cool that it is veggie friendly 
positive,4/8/21, dead heat is the finest quality gucci hot sauce i have ever tried and i am an experienced hot sauce aficionado it is hot enough to be powerul use one drop at a time yet not so hot as to be dangerous to the touch or unusuable for cooking people who make hot wings at home and who are looking for a superior hot sauce to add a measured heat to your wings this is your sauce very very good 
positive,25/9/21,i like this mixture very much it could be less expensive but for taste and quality it is worth the price 
positive,19/10/21,marley s mellow mood is fantastic not only does it taste great but it really works best thing since sliced bread i highly recommend you try some 
positive,4/9/21,soft flavorful and fun i feel a little goofy eating these inch long fruit rolls but they do taste great 
positive,31/8/21,we were getting these for free at work we stopped getting them so i went to smart and final to buy my own my local smart and final did not have them so i ordered a box from amazon cannot wait to get them they are a great snack 
positive,9/10/21,i do not generally care too much for the healthy alternatives especially when it comes to coffee however after trying truvia at a hotel i am now hooked i usually get it at the grocery store but it is good to see that it is available on amazon and now that i have prime i might just be getting it online instead this sweetener tastes really good and in addition to coffee i have had it with desserts and it tastes great i think it even tastes better than sugar and definitely tastes better than splenda i cannot comment as to the health aspects related to artificial sweeteners but i am sure that there is plenty of information available on the internet related to that as a casual coffee drinker i highly recommend truvia however you may want to try one of the smaller box sizes before purchasing a larger quantity just be sure that you like it 
positive,15/6/21,i first tasted this coffe at a casino and was delighted with the wonderful taste it has good flavor and is very affordable i highly recommend it
positive,4/8/21,perhaps i did not read the packaging well this is a lot of candy the toffee melts in your mouth and the chocolate is well done i ended up taking two of the over stuff packages to work where they disappeared in two days wow this heath is really delicious not one bar was broken 
positive,15/6/21,great taste and easy to make in very little time great when adding raisins and whatever your likes and variations may be 
positive,4/8/21,love dreamfields pasta cannot get the lasagna noodles where i live so i was so happy to find them at amazon delivery was quick the only thing is the noodles got broken in shipment which was a dissappointment 
positive,15/6/21,overall the product is fantastic and the coffee is great i am giving a review of stars only because amazon s advertising is misleading it does not come in the advertised box as someone else indicated it is an unmarked box with smaller bags on the inside it is not a plastic k kup the product that you receive is what is pictured with a filter type bottom it does fit in your keurig and brews just fine i love the aroma and the taste of this coffee reminded my husband and i of espresso we had in siily italy a few years ago 
positive,4/8/21,the first thing i would like to say is that the bottom of the k cup is a mesh not plastic but it still goes in my keurig machine just like a regular plastic bottom k cup i do not understand what the fuss is all about it does look a little different from what you may be used to seeing but works just the same now as to the taste of the coffee i think that it is a full body flavor if i want a strong taste i brew regular size amd if i wish to have a milder flavor i will brew the largest cup size i have the best of both worlds i immediately went on subscribe and save i order boxes at a time love the flavor of this coffee now to my complaint i notice today that the price of each box has increased approximately a box and that is within about three weeks time now i really love the convenience of my keurig however eventually the price of the k cups will reach a price that will because me to say no more that time is approaching quickly this brand started out to be more reasonable than most but with this price jump in the last three weeks i am afraid they the company will soon be way overpriced as are the other brands again i will say i do love the flavor of this coffee did i mention my husband likes it as well and he normally does not like decaf coffee 
positive,1/10/21,we have tried alot of the josef products they are all absolutely delicious glad to see amazon is offering them as they can be hard to find their cookies fit the bill for those with allergies to multiple ingredients but you would never know they were allergy friendly from the taste they are worth the price i can serve them to guests kids and adults alike and they never know the difference 
positive,1/7/18,at a couple bucks a bag indulge yourself heavy with the caramel and the flavor a bit light on the nuts but they are in there the cranberries are a very nice touch if you like something chewy with your caramel corn comparable to poppycock but a bit more flavor and lighter on the nuts a very good change of pace 
positive,10/8/18,this has one of the best taste out there on the market i wish it would go on subscribe and save 
negative,1/7/18,i usually use twinings english breakfast loose tea this was a poor substitute for that this tea has a strong earthy taste almost like dirt rather than tea 
negative,10/8/18,i usually choose english breakfast tea because it has a rich flavor this tea was practically tasteless i could go out in my back yard and randomly pick weeds and it would taste better than this stuff i recommend taylors of harrogate if you are looking for english style tea 
positive,13/9/18,i bought this for my wife and she loves it so i will give it a this is not just tea there is powdered milk involved too i was surprised so if that is not your thing 
positive,17/7/18,i have never been much of a fan hazelnut but i do enjoy drinking the international hazelnut non dairy creamier mixed into my morning cup of coffee 
positive,16/1/19,great flavor and a good start to my morning fiber one honey clusters ounce boxes pack of 
positive,16/1/18,finally a high fiber cereal that tastes great i like mixing the honey cluster with either the carmel or the raison cluster for an even higher fiber load and the lowest price i have found these cereals in on amazon com we all love saving money while being healthy right try it for days and i am sure you will love it like i do thanks and have a healthy day 
positive,16/1/19,although they are a bit expensive every now and then these candies are worth considering i wish they sold them in the states because they are so unique in both taste and texture 
negative,1/8/20,i love chocolate shakes and malts and i am playing around with ingredients to achieve flavor with fewer calories i bought some carnation malted milk to add to the mix and make a malt unfortunately this stuff had no malt flavor that i could detect and it made the result undrinkable i am throwing away the rest of the bottle 
positive,1/7/18,the pomegranate flavor in this tea makes it a winner it has that little bit of extra something that you just need sometimes when you drink a lot of tea something different a different flavor if you like to eat pomegranates you will like this if you are not a fan of the fruit you probably will not be a fan of this tea it has that little bit of zing that the fruit has and it is just perfect to drink while watching the sunrise 
positive,10/8/18,i thought that this was a very tasty treat very comparable to non gluten free ones i have had in the past before finding out i was gluten intolerant
positive,15/2/20,fantasicakes sent my cake fast and it was also sent moist for me it is hard to go wrong with chocolate but this cake really is fantastic the icing comes on the side so you can warm it up and drizzle it on at your leisure i really liked that because i do not normally like a lot of icing love it 
positive,22/4/21,these are excellent do not taste sugar free at all they taste just like the regular version and they are sweetened with splenda with no chemical sweeteners they are a little pricey but make a good treat 
positive,25/9/20,great taste candy gets a gooey texture after sitting on counter wrapper sticks to candy other than that the candy is perfect 
positive,16/11/19,i always avoided salt and then i learned about the difference between table salt and sea salt this tastes great on meat a little on eggs you name it i am using it i love the bag and the cost is very fair cheaper than buying at a store 
positive,9/9/20,for an all natural diet drink this is amazing it has a better taste then most other rootbeers that are found in stores and is better for you i originally did not realize this was diet when i bought it but i do not mind at all it is actually much better in my opinion then the non diet version but its up to you note this is really only a good deal if you get free shipping through amazon prime because when these are on sale in stores they cost about the same give or take 
positive,1/7/18,i grew up in portugal eating the real thing fresh grilled sardines and these are very close to that they are the best that i have found in this country highly recommend plus it is great that they are in olive oil 
positive,10/8/18,i love zevia soda it has a weird aftertaste for some but i am in love with this soda that is good for you it does have a very citrusy taste 
positive,15/1/20,i ordered this syrup on a whim and i made the right choice it is very tasty 
positive,1/9/20,i have been eating this for years but it is hard to find in the regular grocery stores so i purchased it over the web it is great for a fast tasty meal we add bite sized chicken breast to it and it is plenty for people 
positive,22/7/21,this coffee has a smoother and more mellow taste than less expensive brands such as folgers and maxwell house and this is a terrific price compared to grocery store prices 
positive,1/7/18,this is a fantastic chocolate bar you cannot even tell it is dairy free this is not a milk chocolate flavor it tastes more like a marriage of milk and dark chocolate i am actually not usually a fan of dark chocolate but this is not overwhelmingly dark at all it is perfect 
positive,10/8/18,this particular flavor of folger s gourmet coffee did not turn out to be my favorite in their gourmet line but it was pretty good nonetheless all of their flavors are good 
positive,14/5/21,exactly what thai iced tea should be i love how each tea bag is individually wrapped allowing me to take the tea anywhere for me to brew keep in mind packaging can be misleading though showing the tea with milk this tea does not have milk in it and you will need to add it yourself aside from that the product itself is excellent though 
positive,17/10/19,very tasty great color recipe on back may be a little too spicy for a thai food virgin start with amount 
positive,3/10/21,stocked up for work when it was on sale per package good for emergencies but would not buy it otherwise 
negative,15/9/20,this jam tastes as if it was made of anything but roses no aroma at all by the time you pay for the shipping may as well buy something else in the local grocery store 
positive,30/8/20,first time id ever purchased whole nutmeg and i am glad that i did it is so much better than already ground nutmeg lasts longer and it quiet simple to use with a good microplane grater 
positive,1/7/18,just a little pricy but worth having made from corn much better than the rice if you haven t tried this i would strongly suggest you give it a try and by buying it at a time it also saves you money
positive,10/8/18, tinkyada brown rice penne pasta with rice bran ounce bags pack of tinkyada makes pasta that actually tastes like pasta i have tried many different brands and nobody comes close to tinkyada if you are allegeric to wheat you can have great tasting pasta again 
positive,5/12/19,this is the best gluten free pasta i have eaten best of all my kids love it 
negative,21/10/19,this made us sick perhaps we got a bad batch we will not purchase this again and would not recommend it would like to add that amazon customer service was awesome in our correspondence with this product 
positive,8/9/20,i am really a huge advocate of cooking from scratch with all fresh ingredients but i really love these seasoning packets especially the one for pork this has not only nice flavors but a bit of thickening i use it whenever i make split pea soup one packet of this per bag of peas and only use half the amount of water they say to use on the bag of peas beautiful thick split pea soup every time or a pot of beans with ham shanks and it always comes out beautifully flavored i do not add salt when i use this but other herbs can be used of course with fantastic results this comes in several other flavors now but this is the one that i use the most just store the packets in airtight containers such as lock lock and they keep practically forever 
positive,22/9/21,this product is fantastic i have had creme brulee many times in france and this is just the same i would recommend it to anyone and my guests have just loved it 
positive,2/10/20,i am allergic to peanuts but i can eat all other nut butters i like the taste of this product and the soy bits give it a texture like crunchy peanut butter i recommended it for those who are allergic to peanuts 
positive,25/7/20,the lemon flavor was evident in this product the price was right and just big enough to satisfy our needs would buy again 
positive,4/7/21,we keep a box of these in our supply bin in the back of our vehicle for snacks on the go yummy 
positive,11/9/21,i was first turned onto this product from a review from cook s illustrated whose american test kitchen rated them the best tasting they are absolutely the best tasting they cost more but it is worth it for the end result and they are organic to boot 
positive,4/7/21,i first found this product in the checkout lines at austrian groceries when i returned back to the us i ordered this from amazon to share with co workers they are espresso filled chocolates and are quite good i had to warn co workers to put the entire thing in their mouth because the espresso is liquid and will drip out if you bite my colleagues snapped them up quickly and we were energized for the rest of the day i had to hide them from my year old because she liked them too and would climb anywhere to find them she already has enough energy 
positive,21/9/21,pilao is my favorite coffe i have tried several brands from around the globe but so far this is the best tasting not bitter nice and smooth 
positive,11/9/21,i usually drink green tea and have used this tea during the summer for iced tea and love the taste very refreshing and prefer this over the store bran green tea 
positive,12/10/21,this is a very tasty flavored coffee the flavor is not overpowering and provides an extra little kick of awesomeness 
positive,11/10/21,this coffee has a rich flavor and nice body without any bitterness no matter what kind of machine you use i enjoy it at all ties of day but especially in the afternoon or after a good meal exceptional depth i love my illy coffee 
positive,28/9/21,the south beach diet bar dark chocolate offer a tasty but relatively healthy treat it has a rich though not overly sweet taste and is fiber rich while low on calories do not expect it to taste like candy this is a granola bar after all but it does offer a rare treat for those trying to lose weight while the heavier fiber intake may make it a little bit of an acquired taste the chocolate makes it a lot easier to acquire if the rest of losing weight could only be this easy 
positive,19/10/21,i bought this because of the antioxidants will keep it for the taste tastes like arabica without being overwhelming its the best of both worlds when you can have a product that is good for you and tastes great too 
positive,4/7/21,my wife has me order this item for her we look like we are a small convinece store in our garage this is the only product she has found to have no sweetner in it so it has flavor but calories and no fake sweetner either if you get bored drinking water try hint this flavor is her favorite
negative,11/9/21,i just got my order today and had to try it out while i will disagree with others that have gotten mush outta the can my initial can was above that not what i would call chunks by any stretch but not mush as for taste pretty much none if it were not for the additives it would not have any taste at all i have never had blue crab but if this is the comparison i will not try it either keep in mind that i can get dungeness year round as well as red rock crab i will likely add it to the cats food maybe she can get some flavor out of it 
positive,12/9/21,this product was nicely packaged which made it easy to throw in my purse or briefcase the flavor was rich and satisfying i will buy this again
positive,13/7/21,simply put this stock has more flavour than most of the other options it will add depth to your soups and sauces if the flavour is too strong you can thin it down with a little water as a bonus it is consistently well priced on amazon and you do not have lug it from the grocery store 
positive,23/10/21,this is the best tasting hot sauce ever yes hot sauce with a flavor my first bottle of this sauce came from a very very good friend when i found out what grocery store it came from i bought all they had now they tell me they cannot get it anymore so where do i go amazon but shipping for bottles of this fine hot sauce is more than the sauce its self 
positive,22/9/21,i was very disappointed when target stopped selling these i bought this pack of bags and they were just like from the store good buy 
positive,4/7/21,i love granola and sometime add rasins or nuts but this stuff was good just as is in a bowl with milk or right from the bag 
positive,11/9/21,not too much to say this worked perfectly in our little fondue fountain and tasted great lots of good feedback from our friends 
negative,8/8/21,the badia cilantro ounce pack of has very little taste and what flavor there is does not resemble cilantro it is reminiscent of a stale oregano this was a very disappointing purchase and i will not be buying any badia products again 
positive,9/7/21,one of my guilty pleasures i have had baklava from many places and of many types i am less enthused about those made with rose or orange flavored sugar water and love that made with honey these are a spiced honey and walnut combination for those who prefer pistachios however these may not impress 
positive,24/10/21,this is a wonderful tasting turkey broth that is so convenient it is very shelf stable so it is handy to keep around the packaging takes up little room in a small kitchen it will be great in stuffing and gravy and will save me the time of always having to make stock before having turkey which i always do as soon as it arrived i put a cup of water into the microwave to boil and then added the contents of the little packet to the water the taste was more than i expected from a convenience product with the addition of some fresh herbs turkey drippings and flour you will be having everyone at the table thinking you are a gourmet chef i will be adding a few packs to the stock i make from the turkey carcass this year it will only help intensify that great turkey flavor i will order this again in the future but for right now the amount i have on hand should last quite a while 
positive,4/7/21,i bought this on whim one day while shopping the unusual flavor interested me when i popped it the wonderful smell of lime filled the kitchen the taste is great not over powering but refreshing tasty this would go great on a summer day or night with margaritas or beer great new flavor would never have thought of adding lime to popcorn but it works 
positive,11/9/21,great price for a quick and healthy side was not sure if i liked whole wheat couscous but it tastes great 
positive,24/10/21,the kids love these they are very tasty and healthier than most toaster pastries

positive,30/7/21,very tasty product good for you and tastes good great combo i love it over the top of vanilla yogurt yummmy
positive,10/7/21,i ordered this cereal for my son who has some minor food allergies he likes it but i am hooked in my opinion this cereal is the perfect blend sweetened but not too sweet nutty but not overwhelmingly so good for you and just plain delicious i eat it with milk or as a snack without milk 
positive,4/7/21,this product is really good my baby loves it every time he can eat it by itself as breakfast lunch or dinner i also sometimes mix it with my homemade food when i need to improve its texture or flavor too spicy too lumpy e t c great healthy option no matter how you want to offer it to your baby or toddler 
positive,11/9/21,the tempura was a gift for a host they reported great taste there really is not much else to say about it i would order again based on taste and service 
positive,20/9/21,it seems like a lot but they are great especially if you have kids i know consumer waste is not a good thing with individual packaging etc but i really like these individually packaged snacks i usually buy a normal box at the store but this has been so nice we always keep a bag handy for trips snack time it is so convenient 
positive,13/10/21,these are great for packing lunches or snacks on the go without all of the bad stuff you get in the other commercially available products great price with the free shipping over too will definitely buy again 
positive,2/8/21,very clean and light calories i have only used it in coffee but it would probably be good over ice cream too my friend joked you could put it in the bath but i think that actually might be a good idea have not tried it yet but since it is made with splends not sugar you probably could get a nice peppermint bath haha weird as a coffee flavor it is very nice by the way the bottles are plastic not glass in case you were wondering 
positive,11/6/21,i love pineapples and these are wonderful they taste great are easily portable and need no refridgeration which is good during the summer i also like the apple and asian pears not so cray about the strawberry bananas and the potato crisps
positive,2/8/21,this honey is very spreadable more like jelly than honey and very tasty the jar it comes in may be small but it is more than worth the price 
positive,18/10/21,these are incredibly good i cannot seem to keep a package of these around very long my family and friends seem to get to them if i do not 
positive,23/7/21,i have never been disappointed with a cafe excellence product this has a nutty vanilla flavor with no oily aftertaste like so many flavored coffees have 
positive,8/7/21,let your puppy naw on these for a month each they will last for months alot less expensive than buying them one at a time at your local pet store save save save only complaint i have is it would be nice if they had a beef flavor added ever the less my lab chews on these rawhide bones alot 
positive,11/6/21,this product is good for any dish i like to just cut it out and eat like snack but remember to go with nice wine or else it will be taste funny in your mouth it also good for cooking with lettuce boil or pan fried the lettuce first then add on this product and make a oyster sauce topping it will be delicious 
positive,25/6/21,i have used this product many rimes and it is the best tasting product for cole slaw i am now having a hard time finding it again but i asked walmart if they are going to sell it again and told me to check after february i have used it for parties and my guest think that is really great and i never have any left overs thanks for a great tasting slaw mix 
positive,2/8/21,i have been a nugo bar fan for years this special flavor is my new favorite it is a great blend between banana and chocolate great texture and taste and i love that this has such a high amount of protein compared to the other bars 
positive,11/6/21,growing up with this tasty treat i was really excited when i found it on amazon great little calorie overload with your afternoon tea or late night milk cookie snack i have no clue how many calores one of wafers will provide and i do not care i love it i treat myself to it from time to time without guilt life is to short to bother with calories wafers are packed with flavor crispy and tasty rum is fake just for flavor no alcohol in it enjoy it and then work out next day a bit harder i do 
positive,9/7/21,calorie count is good the orange smoothie is the best these bars used to be sold by costco they are much moister than other bars 
positive,22/6/21,this ended up being exactly what i was looking for i purchased a slew of nostalgic candy for my birthday party when i came across fun dip the only ones i could find anywhere were the individually packaged flavor packs amazon actually had the big packs that i grew up with with the two sugar sticks and three different flavored sugar packs if that is what you are looking for this is your product on a side note the candies were a big hit 
positive,2/8/21,not much you can say about coconut syrup other than it tastes good item arrived in a timely manner and have no complaints at all to make 
positive,11/6/21,i was expecting this chocolate to not taste good because it is healthy and is made with stevia i am on the maintenance phase of the hcg diet so cannot have any sugar at all i love this chocolate and am getting ready to place another order for it i had to request the nutrition information because none came with it here it is for anyone that wants it serving size bar calories calories from fat total fat saturated fat trans fat cholesterol sodium total carbohydrate dietary fiber sugars protein i eat about half a bar a day after lunch and it really hits the spot good for anyone on a sugar free or low carb diet 
negative,8/7/21,i got this product because i was on the hcg diet and wanted a special treat for valentine s day i was really hoping it would be good but it was not this chocolate can be used in cooking i suppose if you add some additional sweetener to it it did not relieve my craving for chocolate it is very bitter tasting when i tasted a tiny bite it was just a little bitter the bar is divided up into blocks when i put a block in my mouth it was awful and i ended up spitting it out it made me think of taking a spoonful of bitter cocoa and trying to eat it also you have to order such a large amount that it is a huge waste if you do not like it they should sell individual bars so people can know if they like it before buying such a large quantity 
positive,28/9/21,the taste is good and not too hot my only problem is the sodium in tsp is or of the daily allowance a sodium free product would be much better imho this product is really salty on the palate if you mix it with pomi chopped tomatoes ounce tetra pack pack of and garlic you get a good arrabiata sauce this is about half as hot as sriracha hot chili sauce huy fong oz 
positive,23/8/21,after a bariatric surgery i cannot take pills whole i must crush them and mix them with the sugar free apple sauce as you can imagine it is so bitter that you just want to die however if you add this fantastic product you will not taste the bitterness of the medications and it is sugar free it does not taste sugar free it tastes just wonderful i tried mixing my own xylitol sugar alcohol with cinnamon it does not come out that well but this product it is just great there is no aftertaste whatsoever i highly recommend it

positive,11/6/21,i do not know if it gives me any more energy but it has a surprisingly natural flavor with very little if any after taste for a no calorie beverage you can really taste the blueberry 
positive,26/6/21,i love the taste of this hemp protein powder i love to mush up bananas with a fork add some dried figs with raisins and pour this hemp protein all over it with the nutiva hemp seeds it tastes great and satisfies me on every level i also sensed there was much more fiber in the powder compared to other brands i could not believe when i saw that there was grams per serving considering that of americans are lacking in fiber this protein powder can be a great service to millions 
positive,20/8/21,great nutty flavor and delightful texture but what puts it over the top is the great price with the amazon subscribe and save program buy it 
positive,25/8/21,this gum is wonderful a little expensive and cost prohibative for people that chew alot of gum no after taste i hope they bring the price down and come up with more flavors 
positive,19/10/21,i use this on a lot of foods it has a hint of hotness in large amounts but nothing overpowering my favorite use right now is to top off chicken breasts prior to grilling amazing how great they taste and my friends have had nothing but good things to say about it 
positive,2/8/21,this is my favorite snack i love its mild spicy taste it tastes great specially when there is no salsa available 
positive,11/6/21,i had my doubts about these chips until i got my first case i always loved and considered ranch sour cream onion pringle potato chips as the best until i open my first bag of these let me tell you no chip is better than these are i got excellent taste buds to prove it therefore if these chips are extremely good to me then i know they will be tasty to other people try a bag and you will see trust me 
positive,22/10/21,i did not know what to expect since i have never used a pre cooked cornmeal before but i made delicious polenta with it the polenta was creamy and smooth and delicious with a very mild nutty corn flavor and the next day it had hardened and i slices it and fried it in a little butter and it was delicious my first go at arepas was not so successful but i think that i am to blame and not the product my only complaint is that it is hard to find recipes that use it 
positive,6/8/21,if any of you read kim harrison you will know that al always orders a latte with raspberry syrup and extra cinnamon i tried this drink at starbucks and it was wonderful i have an espresso machine at home and thought i could save a lot of time and money making this drink on my own this syrup was perfect it tastes wonderful both in my coffee and also on ice cream 
positive,24/6/21,the stores around here do not carry this product my husband is diabetic and swiss miss no sugar is perfect for us we use it with coffee to make our own cafe mochas 
positive,17/4/21,this makes some great baked goods i am no baking expert but i can follow a recipe pretty well so far i have used it in chocolate chip cookies and waffles i think people are right and saying that you should scale down the amount of vanilla needed i have been using exactly what was on the recipe and i get just a slight alcohol aftertaste if you smell the vanilla right out of the bottle it is clear it is the vanilla you are tasting it is not unpleasant and i do not think anybody would really notice 
positive,10/3/21,my daughter tells me these are the best tasting message hearts i ordered these after valentine s day just because she likes them so much 
positive,17/4/21,open the lid on this lovely salt and you are struck with the unmistakable aroma of truffles the taste is even better a little goes a long way i add a pinch to eggs to turn ordinary into decadent like another review i also love this salt in popcorn i add a pinch to my oil usually clarified butter before popping and supplement with plain sea salt ground fine in the mortar and pestle a nice change of pace this salt is speckled with black truffle flakes that look something like ground black pepper the truffle flavor is infused throughout the salt i received on has a best before date of 
negative,21/1/21,i have tried a few brands of truffle salt i like it on popcorn i thought that this product would be great since it was truffle instead of the i had been purchasing although the aroma of this product is good the taste is just bad not awful bad the bitter flavor is at the front not an aftertaste and there is not a strong truffle flavor i am very disappointed 
positive,30/1/21,i remembered this from when i was a kid i hoped it was as good as i remembered it was this is great if you like honey and cinnamon you cannot miss 
positive,13/2/21,this is literally the best cereal in my entire life that i have ever eaten it is a perfect supplement to a whole foods vegan diet at of protein per cup packed with fiber minerals and vitamins you cannot go wrong with this cereal this texture and taste are not for everyone but for those who like hearty multi grain sugar free types of food this is the cereal for you

positive,6/3/21,i really love black licorice but i could no longer eat it because of the items used in the manufacture of licorice that usually shows up in the stores this is very authentic and gluten free it does come in very large chunks which i cut into smaller pieces because i was chowing down way too much of this great candy at one time it is a tasty licorice 
positive,8/6/21,tried this flavor first time in france this summer and loved the refreshing taste of it the blue and red ones are also very nice but my fav was the silver one too bad it is hard to find elsewhere
positive,7/1/21,this jerky is the soft chewy style though it is listed as sweet n spicy it is quite a bit more sweet than spicy i doubt even the most sensitive to spice would consider this spicy jerky it is tasty it does not have any nitrites message high fructose corn syrup or anything else that is terrible for you it is also affordable the only reason it did not get five stars is that it is not an outstanding and amazing one of a kind flavor worthy of five stars 
positive,17/4/21,our family is fairly new to gluten free we have eaten the original golden malted and find that the gluten free version is similar we like it and are ordering our second batch of cannisters it is a quick easy alternative to making homemade 
positive,10/3/21,received this on time in fact early i was looking for an energy booster during the day at work these chocolates were great tasting and did give me the boost i was looking for i will purchase them again 
positive,14/1/21,purchased this elsewhere for more money will not do that again mainly use it for gluten free cookies etc love it susie c 
positive,24/5/21,i had these crackers in a snack box on a recent delta flight and enjoyed them so much i searched the internet to see where i could purchase them locally unfortunately i could not find a store in my area that sold them the taste is so good you can eat them just as a snack or serve with dips or spreads i ordered the roasted garlic with rosemay and also the onion flavored version which i have not tried yet although some reviewers said their wisecrackers showed up in bits and pieces mine were in perfect shape 
positive,14/10/21,there was a huge internet blow up over these candy corn oreos i love candy corn so i had to try them i have only two targets in my area and both were sold out luckily amazon has them available they have a slight taste of candy corn but not overwhelming on the sweet side interesting i really like the vanilla cookie taste so i enjoyed them my husband thought they were a bit too sweet for his tastes more for me 
positive,7/2/21,my first meal replacement was slim fast unfortunatly it did not work for me before i decided to try this product i did some research this is a good protein shake it has calories and of protein low sugar compare to other drinks i drink it once day after a hour workout for five days a week the chocolate tastes great no need to add the extras like ice juices or fruits for better taste instantly stopped my hunger for a couple of hours gives me a good amount of energy not gassy the packets are great for traveling update so far chocolate it the best flavor vanilla tastes like lite sweet milk have not tried strawberry yet 
positive,29/3/21,this is a great meal replacement i even throw in to the blender fluids that are apple juice and water banana and a strawberry yummy and filling i do not run out of steam on the tennis courts anymore 
positive,17/4/21,i have always loved ceylon black tea but this was the first time i tried green again this is my very favorite it is very mild and does not have the grassy taste of other green teas i highly recommend it ceylon and amazon do it again 
positive,10/3/21,i enjoy indian food but unfortunately the closest indian restaurant is miles away from my house i have tried other commercial indian food products and have not been very pleased the kitchens of india butter chicken curry however is tasty just spicy enough for me well maybe a little on the mild side and easy to make i buy the costco rotisserie chicken debone it put it in pound zip lock bags and freeze them each envelope of the butter curry needs pound of chicken so i just pop the chicken out of the freezer defrost it add the curry paste and butter and in about minutes i have a delicious dinner i will definitely be ordering this product again 
positive,10/7/21,both my daughter and i found this very tasty and it s so easy to make tastes authentic highly recommended 
positive,27/1/21,this was a very easy curry paste to use and it came out very close to what you get at restaurants all i added was butter chicken and water i made servings with one packet of paste but i think if i had more chicken i could have made servings 
positive,1/6/21,these cookies are tasty at times they are a normal part of my daily diet i have eaten a bag for breakfast on multiple occasions also try trader joe s vegan trail mix cookies for an alternative i cannot decide which ones i like better tj s are chewier both rank as my favorite cookies 
positive,20/8/21,delicious only it is not enough for one serving rice are very tasty but gravy is not that great tast and also too much for the rice if they can pack more rice and less gravy that will be very fine 
positive,14/8/21,i have already reordered this item twice i like the taste of it it has the right amount of spice and can be used to make veg briyani if your not very fond of chicken i tried both one of the best products from koi recommended
positive,21/4/21,exceptional coffee all around rich full with subtle hints of dark chocolate my coffee snob neighbor just ordered pounds herself after having just one cup 
positive,1/4/21,this is the best tasting and best price on a stevia product that i have found 
positive,17/4/21,i enjoy the flavor and benefits of fresh wheat grass but it is difficult to keep on hand this powder seems to offer the same punch as well as tasting good i am very pleased with the product and now rely solely on it 
positive,10/3/21,i have tried a few other wheat grass powders and had a hard time drinking them this was very mild i can drink it just mixed with water my year old and year old liked it and wanted more i love all of the amazing grass products they all taste great and are a great company to order from 
positive,22/4/21,this tastes great although i do add a little more cinnamon it does not fill you up like homeade oatmeal does but it is still a nice product 
positive,25/4/21,savory choice is the best stock i have found and i love everything about it first off it is flavor is incomparable to any other pre made stock product and it really tastes like what chicken stock is supposed to taste like i shared it with my grandmother and it won even her stamp of approval secondly i love that it is concentrated so that you make up just the amount you need which is especially handy when you are deglazing a pan to make a sauce for example you do not end up with a whole quart container going bad in your fridge finally if there is anything i learned from ny apt living i love how small the footprint is of the box itself it is also great to pack for backpacking trips to keep in your desk at work etc they make chicken beef and turkey and around the bay area it is available at whole foods berkeley bowl andronico s etc 
positive,1/4/21,i love coffee and this product was a nice mid afternoon pick me up it was refreshingly cold on a hot day and gave me that burst of caffeine energy that keeps me going i enjoyed the taste very much i like my hot morning coffee with lots of milk and a bit of sugar and this was similar to how i make it people who like their coffee black or with milk cream and no sugar will probably not like this product overall i was very pleased with it though i doubt i would buy it often at approximately two bucks a can 
positive,30/6/21,i drink a couple of cups of strong black coffee every day but rarely a fancy drink from a cafe this product is convenient you can just put it in the refrigerator or open the can and pour it over ice or both the taste is smooth and well balanced it has plenty of caffeine and the right amount of milk and sugar i have had a very similar product from starbucks and i really do not sense much of a difference between the two i would probably buy whatever is a better value at the time again this product and the product from starbucks seem to taste the same to me and are of the same high quality 
positive,1/3/21,this little can packs a good punch lots of flavor and a caffeine boost apparently all for just calories according to the can the flavor is very rich but not so rich that you cannot finish it i drank it right from the can as i probably normally would and did notice a bit of a tin after taste from the can i poured the rest into a glass over some ice and it was excellent so if this is going to be your on the road solution you might think again but if you can enjoy it in a glass you will not be disappointed good stuff 
positive,29/1/21,i have had the illy issimo coffee before and liked it so i was excited to try this iced coffee drink this cappuccino has a nice smooth taste with just enough sugar to make it sweet but not overwhelming it gave me a nice jolt of energy to get me through the afternoon but not leave me jittery i will buy this again 
positive,17/4/21,this is a nice little coffee drink not too sweet only calories and as good as starbucks lo fat drinks would have preferred a glass container but the little cans fit really well in my handbag 
positive,10/3/21,this illy issimo italian espresso style coffee drink with lowfat milk and cocoa is quite delicious the cocoa taste is subtle and it is not too sweet the smooth taste beats out other similar prepackaged drinks i have tried each oz can is only calories fat and of protein so it feels like a decent choice nutritionally it contains of caffeine if you are counting illy roasts good coffee and even masked by the sugar and milk you can tell this arabica coffee is the good stuff it is very smooth no bitter burnt taste like some coffee roasters are prone to these drinks are made in denmark and distributed by coca cola in the us which piqued my interest i would recommend these to people who like to have some cold coffee drinks on hand for busy mornings or a quick pick me up 
positive,30/5/21,this is the first cold coffee drink without crushed ice like a frappuccino at starbucks i have ever had i do enjoy coffee but during the summer i often turn to soft drinks instead i usually do not want a hot drink when it is degrees outside i was not sure what to expect from this but was surprised that it was quite delicious and refreshing being a cappuccino it has low fat milk which is nice since most places just use whole milk and a hint of cocoa not too much where you cannot taste the coffee but there is a hint that makes it perfect because of the low fat milk and cocoa this beverage has calories of fat sat fat of carbs and of sugar from label that is not too bad considering what some coffee beverages have the coffee is very strong and has a great taste it is not bitter and drinks very smoothly when i got this item i placed it in the fridge and it was in there fore a few days so it was nice and cold and it was very refreshing and smooth the coffee was the primary taste in the drink and the milk and cocoa were secondary so you got a nice taste of what tasted like high quality coffee with a smooth finish from the milk and cocoa i am very pleased with this drink and found it quite refreshing and a nice change from a standard cup of coffee especially during these hot days and with only calories it is a great start to the day highly recommend 
positive,28/9/21,no complaints whatsoever this is a tasty coffee drink the coffee is strong and good and the sweetener is perfect just sweet enough without being that kind of sickly sweet that mars something like starbucks pre made iced coffee drinks just about perfect refreshing and a nice boost for the afternoon 
positive,6/5/21,if you are already a fan of illy coffee in general whole bean ground espresso most likely you will enjoy this can of cappucino coffee the flavor of this drink is heavy on coffee with light milk lowfat added the bitterness of the coffee is only lightly offset by the milk so hopefully if you decide on this drink it will be for a coffee flavor and not a more milky coffee flavor there is also a hint of sweetness though i did notice that the sweetness seems to be closer to the bottom of the can the can indicates that it should not be shaken so maybe this is expected there are calories per can and gave me a decent caffeine jolt the can indicates this is a product of denmark and is distributed by the coca cola company the weird part here is that illy is an italian brand guess it costs too much to import from italy no idea there i only received one can as part of the vine program but have purchased single serve cans of this on my own and will without doubt purchase further cans of it 
positive,20/4/21,this is one of my absolute favorites would recommend to anyone i have even gotten coworkers hooked on it because it is so good 
positive,20/4/21,i tried this product on a whim hoping that it would be good to my surprise it was very good i was pleased that the ingredients did not include trans fat or high fructose corn syrup for a convenience item i give it high marks it tastes great and is extremely easy to prepare 
negative,21/4/21,after reading the reviews i decided to order a bag and try it i had had numerous styles of kona coffee over the years and love the smell and flavor when it arrived i ground some up and brewed up a pot the smell was there but the flavor was lacking it was missing that kona pop that i have experienced in the past with other coffee s over the next few weeks i tried different brewing combinations no matter what i tried it was quite bland and just did not have any flavor i was quite disappointed by the coffee 
positive,2/5/21,we got them to add to special k red berry cereal because sometime the end of the bag as fewer than the start but now we eat them by the hand full and add them to everything my daughter grabs the bag over other snack food which makes me smile 
negative,18/12/19,i am not sure how or why this soup mix is getting such good reviews it has no flavor whatsoever when they dehydrated the ingredients they pulled all the flavor out i have tried everything to make a decent dish with this stuff but always turns out bland and tasteless the recommend mix is also way off cups water mix you will end up with a lintel sludge that is nothing like soup i think i could probably calk my bathroom with it or make a nice adobe hut however if you are into very bland food this will probably be good if you like flavor stay away 
positive,19/1/20,one of the only apple drink mixes i found that tastes good i used to buy the walmart brand apple drink but that tasted too fake for my taste this one contains some sugar so it has some calories but taste wise it is like light apple juice with a hint of artificial flavoring 
positive,19/1/20,these are wheat free gluten free non dairy granola bars they taste pretty good they are not listed as organic but it seems like they should make them that way since they are free of so many other things some of the ingredients are listed as organic but not all they taste good there are of sugar per each bar just fyi for anyone wondering about the ingredients for allergies or food sensitivities here they are in order gluten free oats organic agave rice blend brown rice flour white rice flour tapioca starch sweet rice flour xanthan gum coconut sugar raisins monounsaturated safflower oil organic eggs walnuts coconut chia seeds natural vanilla flavor sices baking soda sea salt xanthan gum grainless aluminum free baking powder sodium bicarbonate sodium acid pyrophosphate potato starch 
positive,31/3/20,these bars are a tasty snack the taste is like a dry carrot cake it is a little chewy and has a nice texture with nuts and raisins it is surprisingly high in calories for each bar 
positive,18/12/19,pamela s oat raisin walnut spice bars are moist and tasty although the ingredients are top notch they gave me heartburn 
positive,13/10/19,the hotlix scorpion sucker is a pretty tasty pretty wild and a pretty fun treat for any occasion i used it for a presentation in by biology class and it was received very well by the teacher and my fellow students 
positive,28/9/20,eat it by the handful mix with baking or other food or mix with bee pollen for ultimate nutrition 
positive,16/11/20,not much to say i grew up on this stuff and it is very good 
positive,27/2/20,bought this in spite of the high price and unreasonble s h just to match what i make at home i mix it with fresh ground hemp seed i buy the almonds in the she will at soak the nuts and grind them in my vitamix beats peanut butter to hell and back 
positive,26/2/21,i like it it is got the same after taste as the granulated if you are wondering i find it pleasant used it in coffee today and it was the perfect sweetness and actually once it was in coffee to me it was the same flavor as sugar with no aftertaste i do not like splenda very much and cannot stand sweet n low been using stevia for a few months and got this to stir into yogurt excited did not realize it had to be refrigerated but that was just my own ignorance was hesitant but now i highly recommend the sweetleaf stevia clear 
positive,18/12/19,adds flavor to all sorts of dishes great for deviled eggs mix with the yoke filler and top it off with a slice of jalepeno 
positive,19/1/20,i have always wanted a tea i could drink at night that would not wake me up at in the morning i have always liked black currant so this was a win win for me the tea is delicious 
positive,13/9/20,i now have to lower soduim intake and this does the trick it tastes great and you do not miss the salt i usually eat with reduced fat or sodium cheese and enjoy every bite even the family is liking it the variety does proove difficult to find though wish amazon carried it regularly 
positive,10/7/20,i do not eat them myself i bought them for my husband because he is greek and loves greek food he loves them very much so they last him for meals thank you very much 
positive,14/4/21,we have had this spice blend since picking it up at a whole foods in portland after tasting a sample company was coming over and we needed something easy that could be prepped ahead enter the moroccan spice blend and it received rave reviews we used boneless skinless chicken breasts and marinated them for about a day and a half when it came time to cook we just dumped them into a dish and baked as directed for an hour serving it with couscous moroccan carrot salad and coconut cupcakes we spent the rest of the evening thoroughly stuffed absolutely delicious sweet and savory the blend had just the right amount of kick without setting our mouths on fire fabulous 
positive,24/4/21,this dip is absolutely delicious it is so easy to make the price is also exceptional 
positive,28/4/21,this coffee tastes great i usually purchase folger s classic style blend from sams due to the convenience of the packaging and expected level of flavor one day i bought a package of from seatle s best from wally world wal mart for having already experienced the goodness from borders before they went bankrupt i was happy to see a great price on the product i absolutely have fallen in love with this coffee a cup of this and coldstone sweet cream creamer is great simply put i prefer to have my day start with that combination and i am saddened whilst i am at work and my cup finally runs empty however the price on bags seems a bit high as a pack of goes for on here as well huge markup on the pack which makes no sense

positive,18/12/19,great product received it in a timely manner if you like tea this is a keeper 
negative,19/1/20,i really love herbal tea especially orange and mandarin but all of teekanne s teas were tasteless and even if you put two packages in a cup of tea you still get no taste now i have three packages of teakanne relaxing and energizing and i do not know what to do with it surely will not drink it 
positive,28/4/21,this really does taste a lot not exactly like regular bubble gum it is thick chunky and kid s can make huge pink bubbles with it and it lasts and lasts as a treat you do not have to worry about for a child or as a diet item for an adult this is great 
positive,8/8/20,i tried mccormick smoked paprika a few months ago and was enchanted with this new flavor i started delving into indian cuisine and the ingredients listed smoked paprika i found this spice at the local foodlion store and it was quite expensive for a bottle i am glad to see this larger size at such a good price i like the taste of mccormick so i hesitate to try another brand highly recommended 
positive,22/5/21,this was an excellent purchase the product itself was a perfect blend making it smooth and easy to drink the service of the seller was great and very fast i would recommend this seller without hesitation 
positive,18/12/19,i tried these out last weekend just as the temps have started to dip and i was not disappointed i expected a very fake and chemical tasting brew but was pleasantly surprised that i got neither i was very happy to ready that there are no artificial ingredients in this one too this is a great alternative for when you want something different from coffee and tea if i had to point out anything bad about them maybe that the flavor is almost too sweet if you brew it on your smallest cup setting mine is for the keurig special edition it is a tad tooo strong but in the medium size offerning its just right i hate having to buy packs though 
positive,19/1/20,we love hot apple cider and this was no exception my year old drank cups the very first day i got this it has a wonderful fresh apple taste with just the right amount of spice we will be ordering this on a regular basis

positive,1/4/21,this item is very tasty it actually tastes better than bouillon when i made pilaf using this chicken base it tasted exactly the way it tastes when i use homemade chicken base lots of flavors kosher halal natural product with number one ingredient being chicken with natural juices and reasonable price what else to expect from a jar of chicken base

positive,6/7/21,pasta knorr sauce parma rosa creamy tomato pardon me while i rave about how incredible this pasta mix is but i am just totally in love with this sauce i love to eat pasta but i am usually confined to the higher fat alfredo sauces and cheese sauces because acidic tomato sauces irritate my acid reflux that means no spaghetti and meatballs which has been frustrating for me but that is life eh then while i was browsing the sauce aisle for knorr alfredo packets i found this parma rosa sauce i have no idea what vodka sauce is that the other reviewers reference but whatever this is it is good if i had to describe it i would call it a creamy tomato alfredo but even though it is creamy it is also very light and pleasing to taste not cloying the tomato taste is exquisite and the acid content is low enough to prevent stomach pains the taste itself is absolutely wonderful i can actually talk myself out of impulse eating by promising myself parma rosa later it is that good the knorr sauces are fairly easy to make the instructions are serious when they say to stir constantly though and i think it helps to preheat the milk before adding the powdered mix and they store indefinitely in these dried packets another reason to buy packets besides the smaller carbon footprint in shipping versus jars oh and buying them on amazon means i get them for half the price of the local market for the parma rosa i also add about a third of a pound of seasoned browned ground beef as easy meatballs the portions are such that i can easily get two full meals out of one sauce packet and the sauce stores perfectly in the fridge this coming from a person who generally hates leftovers ana mardoll
positive,13/8/21,this is a great product that is very easy to make it never clumps which is a great plus when it comes to dry sauce mixes i personally favor the knorr white sauces e g the alfredo or garlic herb which is the only reason why i am not giving this stars overall it is very enjoyable nice to have around when you do not want to make sauce from scratch and i would definitely purchase again 
positive,5/6/21,i took this stuff on a two week camping trip i put it in chilli made tacos and soups this is the best tasting sour cream powder i have ever come across buy this stuff now one bag lasted campers for about meals used as a condiment 
positive,9/7/21,mushrooms can add a lot of flavor to a dish canned mushrooms are bland and boring and fresh mushrooms have a limited shelf life dried mushrooms pack a lot of flavor and have a long shelf life i believe they are good for up to years a one ounce package of dried is the equivalent of a half pound of fresh they need to be soaked in warm water for about an hour to hydrate before using the water used for hydrating can be used in your dish for added flavor it can also be reduced to concentrate the flavor once hydrated the mushrooms can be used in any application that you would use fresh or canned the chanterelles are a mild less earthy tasting fungus they go very well with eggs chicken and fish they are also great in a stir fry the fungusamongus is a high quality brand that i highly recommend 
positive,17/6/21,we first tried this sauce in costa rica on vacation when we ran out of what we had brought home with us i was so glad to find it on amazon this bottle is huge and will last quite a while this sauce is really good it has a kind of smokey spicy flavor 
positive,31/8/21,i heard about sour sop on the internet for being a great cancer fighter time will tell if the claim is true but i will say this it tastes great 
positive,7/8/21,great tasting coffee it was a hit at the office as well as at home i wil typically mix it at home with a darker roast columbiam type coffee as i like my coffee a little darker but either way glad i tried it 
positive,6/9/21,i despise low fat non fat dressings and would prefer to eat a salad plain rather than use them but these walden farms dressings taste great and make a diet less monotonous my husband likes them too and he always prefers the high calorie version of anything 
positive,5/6/21,very pleased with the quality of this product a beginner at cake decorating this was very easy to work with and the flavor was great as expressed by all that tasted it will be ordering more product from this company 
positive,9/7/21,i like nature valley granola bars because they fill me up better than other brands such as special k or the quaker oats granola bars they are also chewy and sweet great for a snack or a quick breakfast my only complaint is that it is a little too sweet 
positive,19/6/21,this is a really good product while it is only ounces it is actually about a quart of freeze dried shallots i have long used fresh shallots extensively in cooking and these are an excellent replacementwhen fresh is not required such as salads etc they save all the work of peeling and chopping fresh shallots for cooking the product while fairly costly as are fresh shallots is a real time saver and worth every penny of the cost freeze dried is much better than just plain dried i use freeze dried herbs whenever i can find them as they more exactly replace fresh products if you use shallots you will love this product 
positive,5/9/21,these bars are quite tasty and a little crumbly if you factor in the weight to calorie ratio they are about the same ratio wise to nature valley bars the amazon or quaker description says ozs however each bar is only ozs the whole package of weigh oz but i did give them stars on taste because of my particular fondness for anything blueberry one would have to check pricing per ounce with other brands for the value conscious 
positive,10/10/21,great simple snacks for those who are watching calories at calories a bar these have an amazing blueberry flavor and all natural texture there is no doubt that these will get you through your hunger to your next meal without packing on the pounds these bars are a step up in the granola breakfast snack bar catagory highly reccomended 
positive,29/9/21,originally i hated this cereal becaused it tasted so bland and powdery when hot or cold however after eating it three times i have strangely learned to love it and now i have been eating it for one month so this was an acquired taste for me that i will definitely order again when i get tired of my steel cut oatmeal if you are not use to eating healthy foods however you might dislike this cereal and never acquire a taste for it 
positive,11/9/21,this flaxseed meal is the best ever i have tried several brands that i purchased in local markets but it is not that easy to find whole ground flaxseed around where i live so the ones i was able to find had a sand like texture and taste my wife could not stand it despite of the known benefits of taking it this flaxseed texture is awesome for her and she is enjoying it she mixes with milk in the morning and smoothie in the afternoon and does not complain anymore about the taste i take it before the meals with juice and i think it has a wonderful nutty taste i had initially setup the subscription for every months but we liked it so much we are changing it for every months 
positive,5/6/21,i love this product delivered on time and taste great i use a lot of butter in my cooking and this large size is perfect all the tasted without the bad stuff 
positive,9/7/21,these biscuits are really good i bring them to school as a snack after practice or before lunch i think they are a lot better than nutri grain bars and quaker oats granola bars i have also tried the apple flavored onesbut the blueberry ones definetely taste better it is also really easy to find coupons for them on the internet or just google belvita coupons 
positive,26/8/21,this was not quite what i expected the last time i ordered a similar treat it was thinner crispy banana slices these are thicker bananas my dog loves them but there is so much banana that i cannot give her more than one or two a week too rich they give her the runs but she loves them 
positive,26/7/21,this tastes great i have shared it with several people and they love it 
positive,11/9/21,i have enjoyed using the maple flavor it adds flavor to my diet that i would not have without it 
positive,11/9/21,how much is there really to say about salt the size of the ground crystals will depend on your grinder i find fine to be good for some foods like eggs and prefer a coarser grind for other foods potatos the sea salt has a more complex flavor than regular plain table salt for me the flavor of the sea salt is much prefered over normal salt 
positive,15/9/21,this hafi lingonberry preserves not only arrived in a timely fashion but also adds favorably to our morning and afternoon snack experiences not too sweet not too tart my husband adds it to the very healthy shake he makes for the two of us each morning i also occasionally like to get my healthy bit of snack in by dipping a few toasted pita chips in the early afternoon when i get most hungry just one or two chips with a total of about one teaspoon of preserves will do it for me for a healthy snack that will not spoil my dinner very happy with the product 
positive,5/6/21,i love oatcakes so of course like most i did the topping go around and i thought try something way different hear me out it is not bad marmite on oatcake lol try it sometime nairns oatcake is great with anything on it or nothing just depends on the person 
positive,9/7/21,i bought a box of these as a special sure glad i bought when i did as the price went up drastically i love raspberries and wanted to try dark chocolate over milk chocolate these taste excellent i consider them a treat after dinner as if i was eating one of those very expensive chocolates but for much less the cost they are small enough that i do not feel like i am packing away pounds by eating one or two yet are very flavorful in a small candy i would buy again but having of them i have enough for awhile will probably take some to work to share with the group 
positive,14/9/21,nowadays it is really difficult to get a really natural pineapple fruit specially where i live but this product is just fantastic you can feel the smell and the flavor of a natural pineapple thank you 
positive,29/9/21,for a non organic or non gourmet item this tastes amazingly fresh crunchy and yummy beware calorie count fat and salt content is considerable but one bag upon occasion should not explode your cholesterol count crunch fresh yum salty and a good deal free with some other stuff i bought 
positive,10/7/21,i love the flavor i lived in ny and found this tea with a great taste that i liked but when i moved to ga i could not find it anywhere other teas are ok but i really enjoy the taste of bromley tea i visit ny twice a year so i would buy it there and bring it to ga a month supply i love the flavor so much that even my friends would watch for a sale to buy it for me and mail it i am so glad that i found it at amazon so i can order it myself and always have a supply on hand

positive,26/3/21,this product is just as expected i am new to making my own sushi so i have no experience prior to buying this product i have made many spicy tuna rolls and the nori has yet to break on me i am not sure if it is because i have practically mastered the art of sushi not really or just gotten lucky and not rolled the sushi too tightly either way this was a great buy shipping did not take long at all had the nori by the end of the week would buy again
positive,29/8/19,i love this oil it smells great it works its magic it is great for babies it is great for moms if you use cloth diapers it is awesome strongly recumbent it instead of all those products full of chemicals like johnson johnson stuff

positive,14/10/21,great taste the only complait is that they are a little big in size to put in everyone mouth they should of made them a little smaller and thicker
positive,7/8/20,nearly perfect snack chip just a trifle too much salt and sugar keep them from getting stars the air pockets in the chips make them crisp but tender the flavor is similar to kettlecorn but thankfully not as sweet 
positive,1/3/20,nice to see more than one flavor in a case my cat really likes this one likes the extra gravy ones the best wish they sold them in varriety packs they use meat by products in their food i could not get my cat to eat any thing else she did not like the natural food up to you 
positive,28/7/20,have been using this in my morning chai for several months now and it is absolutely incredible the only bad thing i can say about it is that it can be a little addictive follow up we usually like to use cream in our coffee as a treat on the weekends half nhalf what is that the other day we were out so i used the santini condensed milk instead all i can say is wow actually enjoyed it more than cream and then i compared the labels the condensed milk has considerably less saturated fat and cholesterol than cream we are never going back 
positive,14/9/21,bought this because our new son in law loves it and they could not find it in stores anywhere he was thrilled 
negative,17/12/20,i really love herbal tea especially honey and vanilla but all of teekanne s teas were tasteless and even if you put two packages in a cup of tea you still get no taste now i have three packages of teakanne relaxing and energizing and i do not know what to do with it surely will not drink it 
positive,2/5/20,i love juice it is my favorite beverage now this product adds a little zing to regular fruit juice it is ver refreshing and a great beverage love the flavors not sugary sweet but a little tart and with the carbonations a little zing 
positive,14/7/21,this tastes like actual soda pop you would never know it was healthy for you every can is lightly carbonated and gives you vitamin c and contains percent real fruit juice what more can you ask for i got the variety pack and all the flavors taste good i only wish amazon kept it in stock for the subscribe and save 
positive,18/7/19,switch bev taste great my fav was the grape but they all have a great taste most important my kids love them 
positive,1/3/20,first my shipment arrived without any dent or leak in any of the cans which is awesome i will begin to review all the flavors except for cherry i have not tried the cherry one grape this one is my favorite it tastes almost like normal grape soda but you can still taste the real fruit juice it leaves the after taste of real grape juice the carbonation is about the right amount orange my second favorite flavor it was very yummy and taste very real if you let a friend drink it he she will be able to tell it is made from real juice and not artificial flavor lemon lime great combination of flavors the tartness is just right but the flavor is just ok nothing impressive kiwi berry watermelon strawberry i found these two too sweet the kiwi berries taste is too strong it almost reminds me of artificial flavors in candy cherry i did not try this flavor but my boyfriend said it is his favorite and he loves it bottom line get this variety pack to see what flavors you like my bf and i both love carbonated drinks but stopped drinking regular soda a while ago due to high fructose corn syrup the can size is a little small but it is easy to pack with your lunch to take on the go

positive,19/10/20,tasty better than others i have bought and good price the bag helps keep them moist too as opposed to the canisters 
positive,1/3/20,rosemary is nothing like peppermint as it has much more subtle taste at a tablespoon in oz of drinking water it is still not harsh kind of mild according to miracle food cures from the bible it is supposed to help with memory and old age it is easy to imagine rosemary chicken over seasoning would be hard to do this great stuff as it has been around a long time thank you 
positive,28/7/20,i have never ordered canned goods online before this so i was nervous boy what a great experience i do not have access to a asian market where i am and i really wanted to make masaman rather than order take out i followed the recipe on the can reducing it by half as was recommended in one of the reviews it was really flavorful and a tad spicy i might even try a quarter of the amount next time so happy that this worked out

positive,28/3/21,these cereal bars are fantastic all of their verities have great fruit flavors and not to mention no added sugar fruit juice sweetened and plenty sweet enough perfect for a mid morning snack or otherwise 
negative,6/2/20,the leaf in the bag and the overall packaging quality is good but no one in our family and group of friends likes the taste since it has all the other positive reviews i have been subjecting people to it off and on since my july purchase trying to find at least one person to say it tastes good with no luck it does not taste like peaches to us it has an off taste that makes our gang say yuck we like many different kinds of flavored hot tea and switch between drinking black or green iced tea usually decaf and usually made as sun tea some of us add sweetener some of us do not we like peaches both fresh and canned for these reasons i cannot blame our dislike of the taste on the simple fact that it is flavored and a green tea maybe the passion fruit in it someone else mentioned is not our cup of tea 
positive,25/4/21,this curry pates really helped me cut back on time i would spend to make a good meal will definitely buy again
positive,3/8/20,recommended by a friend i am a big green tea lover would like to try out anything with green tea flavor this soil milk tastes rich but not too sweet enjoyed it a lot will order more in the future

positive,27/2/18,this is one of the better gluten free crusts i have tried i prefer it to all the pre made crusts it takes some prep time but the slightly doughy texture is well worth the wait it is good if not better than crust i have had in gluten free pizzerias 
positive,20/2/18,this is the most versatile tasty nutritious product i have come to encounter can be used as cereal a snack etc delicious and nutritious

positive,2/11/18,i am not sure about the claims that sour sop kills cancer cells but i am hoping it does even if it does not it is a great tasting drink i am sure it has health benefits too 
positive,14/10/18,in the great british trifecta of british powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar horlicks the most malty milo is medium chocolately and malty and ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately all are basically comfort drinks when plain milk just will not do all are powders to which you add milk and sugar to get a sweet malty drink the latter two with chocolate flavor as well i love all drinks but if you are drinking this for nostalgia s sake make sure you get the ovaltine from where ever your nostalgia springs from because ovaltine is made in different countries and they all taste a little different for me ovaltine is the most chocolately of all and a great comfort drink for cold nights i like it more than simply hot chocolate because it is not as sweet and has a slight malty flavor to it best of all you can control the taste because you can adjust the amounts of sugar and ovaltine you add 
positive,6/4/20,these noodles are delicious and surprisingly my favorite of all the flavors so far i orderd some for my daughter also and son 
positive,9/3/18,just a hint of honey and lemon perfect balance great taste does not even need to be sweetened 
positive,18/5/18,gives popcorn a pleasing color and let us the corn pop fully i have been very satisfied i will purchase more of this 
positive,7/3/18,these are a delicious meatless alternative to meatballs and work perfectly with marinara sauce or simply heated in their own gravy 
positive,24/1/19,these chips are awesome and semi healthy however you can buy them cheaper at costco i got a oz bag there for which works out to cents per ounce if you buy them through amazon you pay cents per ounce 
positive,27/2/19,i really like these crackers and i am thrilled that amazon offers this product i am a bariatric patient and it is always hard to find a crunchy treat that is healthy i save a ton of money too because buying individual boxes was getting quite pricey for me since i eat at least crackers each day i have tried all flavors that amazon offers they all are quite tasty but this one is my all time favorite 
positive,19/4/20,these are my favourite flavour of rice crackers they are especially great with hummus 
positive,17/4/20,item taste wonderful is easy to use and is a great price gave one to my sister who has alergies to regular soy sauce 
positive,3/4/20,we happened to be at whole foods and a lovely woman was offering free samples of violas hot jalepeno jelly omg it is fantastic it is got a definite kick to it but it is not too terribly hot at all perfection it is just sweet enough to balance out the hot it is light and delicious and best of all it is not full of all the artificial preservatives and high fructose corn syrup and additives of which most jellies are contaminated i love this product 
positive,7/8/19,i have tried to capture the taste of really fine coffee i have experienced in some excellent restaurants without much success including grinding my own beans buying expensive ones at specialty shops etc this product while not quite doing justice to my memories of great coffee comes closest it is somewhat expensive at about lb supermarket coffees are of course much cheaper and you can get larger packages at discount places for much much less i even tried mixing this coffee with folgers and it was pretty good too naturally this coffee is much richer so one needs to experiment a bit to figure out how much to use in your coffee maker i drink coffee straight up no sweetener no milk products but i like it pretty strong but not burnt or over roasted this coffee is not over roasted or bitter unless you use too much of it i found it superior to the other melitta products i have tried as well as to other much vaunted brands such as starbucks seattle s best and gevalia but taste is on the tongue of the beholder 
positive,9/3/18,update january i am now a pretty regular drinker of this stuff in fact i just ordered some more and i note the price has gone down which makes it very afforable take in the free shipping and it is an absolutely delicious steal i am really enjoying this coffee i usually drink folgers at home and have done so for nearly years this was a pleasant surprise the aroma as it was brewing was scintillating the taste with my regular creamer and sugar was a treat for my taste buds i finished two cups and was tempted to drink more because it was such a smooth tasting coffee i used heaped tea spoon fulls for make cups as marked on my coffee maker and it worked out just about right for me though some hard line coffee drinkers make like it stronger than that the package itself was a little hard to open i found the best way was to cut the top off with scissors and use the metal bands on the package to securely close it as airtight as possible this a really nice coffee but the only way to be sure you will like it is to try it 
positive,18/5/18,i have long been a fan of german based melitta products and found their coffee to be far superior to most of the mainstream popular coffees and even some so called exclusive or select blends blanc et noir is one selection from their cafe collection which i would put in the medium to dark roast catagory a full bodied flavor without acidity but not too strong that is when made in french press i do not use old style leave it in the pot all day machines a lot of people have switched to the pod type or single cup brewing systems lately and in fact coffee consumption seems down in general in favor of herb teas and non caffeinated drinks so it was nice to go back to an old style ground coffee taste if you like european style ground coffees you may also like to try douwe egberts intense real coffee dark roast ground coffee ounce packages pack of which is dutch or the bold flavored jacobs kr ouml nung coffee ounce vacuum packs pack of another point worth mentioning is cost these value packs here work out pretty cheap compared to pod systems bags or cups and are even not that bad compared to everyday grocery store prices when compared to gourmet stores like gevalia they are a steal and great quality 
positive,27/1/19,these bars were recommended to me by a nutritionist and fitness expert they are wonderful if you like chocolate you will love these bars they are also very good for you with all organic ingredients 
positive,10/11/19,my son turned me on to this product and it is one of the best new products around just minutes makes a pitcher of tea that tastes like it has steeped for hours i buy this product on subscribe and save which is cheaper than walmart and keep it all year round thanks amazon for a wonderful product and the convenience of having it delivered to my door 
positive,8/11/19,i have always been a little curious about barley tea as i see it often mentioned in manga and japanese stories i finally got a chance to try it the other day with the sokenbicha brand this tea is not sweetened which is part of the reason i purchased it i am on a diet so i prefer to sweeten my beverages with stuff like splenda or equal i did not really need it with this drink there is a slight bitter tea taste but it is definitely not overwhelming and i did not really think that it deterred from the drink to be honest i did not add any sweetener to it at all it did not need it and i think it would have killed the taste there is a great nutty ish type of flavor that i am going to assume is the barley i adore it and while i do not think i would be able to drink it constantly i really want to drink this again to the point where i would be willing to drive to the organic grocery store that is about a half hour out of my way i do have to warn you if you are a fan of the more traditional teas black tea iced tea etc then this will take some getting used to it is tasty but i can see where it would not be to all tastes still very much worth trying and i am definitely going to be looking for barley tea in general but stuff like this is good for me to take to work where i cannot brew up big batches of tea 
positive,25/10/21, i am so impressed this is the best price i have ever seen for this product the quality is awesome and they had it shipped to me so fast that i had it within a week fantastic price quality and service do not get no better than that my husband and i are hooked this is delicious after eating this you will never go back to rolled processed minute oatmeal 
positive,8/5/20,i like this so much that i use it in most of the foods that need a pork flavor i have even used it in home made baked beans 
positive,28/9/18,this lo carb pancake mix is really good and easy to make you cannot even tell it is a lo carb product i made some pancakes with it and give one to my boyfriend he could not even tell it was a lo carb product i would buy this again 
positive,29/7/19,i love this tea its got a great taste and does not leave you all jumpy and wired after you drink it the only thing i have against this tea is that it is cut very small small enough to drift out of my infuser and leave a bunch of loose tea in my tea 
positive,9/3/18,not only is this tea delicious but it is organic and very cheap i have bought rooibos from over other stores and it has never been this cheap or this good davidson s for the win
positive,18/5/18,we have been paying big bucks for little cans of rooibos tea at the health food store and brewing ice tea with it that we drink by the gallon i was surprised that the davidson s rooibos was richer and tastier and brewed up a nice clear amber brown color better quality and less expensive 
positive,17/5/20,cranberry grape xs has a wonderful taste and helps give me energy for my daily workouts with out the crash effect later in the day xs unlike other energy drinks balances out the day 
positive,26/3/20,these almonds deliver the crunch of freshness that i love in nuts some nuts you can tell are old because of their softness but these almonds are incredible and tasty great for a quick pick me up 
positive,24/2/20,these are one my favorite kind of sun chips they have a zesty taste that is not too sharp or bland with just the right kick and a nice crisp texture while these are not a health food their sodium and fat content is much better than other snack foods these chips work really well with a dip and vegetables for a pre dinner snack shop for price the price printed on the oz bag that i buy at my local supermarket is and i pay less on sale so the price on amazon is higher than the manufacturer s suggested retail price 
positive,3/5/19,this is very tasty good deal to save a few bucks here on amazon as well i find this dish very similar to the chicken tikka masala both are great obviously this curry dish has more curry flavor than the chicken tikka masala the chicken in this dish is wonderful as well 
positive,27/3/20,generally speaking i really like mini wheats so this cereal was appealing to me already i enjoyed the flavor very much since it did not taste artificial i also liked the fact that it contains brown rice syrup in it instead of corn syrup it gives it a different flavor that enhances the cinnamon and combines very well with the wheat my active teen daughter is a big breakfast eater and if she eats cereal she is usually hungry within a couple of hours this kind held her for hours it is hard to measure pieces serving size so we just served about a cup which is a little more than what the average cereal calls for overall the cereal tasted good and was good for the tummy i am looking forward to buying some more 
positive,31/12/20,these are moist soft and chewy with a really nice texture the cinnamon flavor is really good nice and strong i love cinnamon and really natural tasting not artificial like a lot of cinnamon flavors they are a little on the small side like or bites but also pretty low cal cals so they make a nice snack or light breakfast i will definitely be buying these again 
positive,13/1/20,we love making special coffees and this just added a great touch to them also we have put it on top of our soy ice cream and found it to have a nice taste on that as well oh we have also added it to our soda making vanilla coke vanilla dr pepper and vanilla orange soda very very nice 
positive,21/9/20,i am pretty new to the coffee scene but i really like this roast it is quite flavorful and rich it was the first coffee i bought i tried a few more and i came back to this 
positive,2/12/20,i have a weak spot for grape soda among other not so good for you treats admittedly i do not pay that much attention to what goes into them but i do try to moderate what i consume from time to time this stuff is great tastes almost as deliciously bad for you as the real thing but since it is not as syrupy as welch s grape soda it actually is more refreshing after downing the whole can if you are concerned with all the bad stuff in the other stuff but cannot keep away give this one a try 
positive,20/11/19,great carbonated beverage my son gets it at school and loves it i cannot find in local stores so i bought it here kids love it 
positive,2/12/20,purchased this water at first due to the fact i needed the water bottle to fit into a drink holder case it was a win win situation because it tasted great too 
positive,11/12/19,fantastic espresso beans i usually drink illy but thought i would give this a shot and i was not disappointed this has a slightly smokier flavor than the illy roasts produces a nice crema and is ultra smooth in short give this a try highly recommended for my fellow coffee heads out there 
positive,20/11/19,i have had it with brisket turkey and chicken fingers it is great on everything just the right amount of kick it is hard to describe sweet but spicey my kids love it their ages are nine to nineteen 
positive,28/6/20,arrived room temperature but i knew that would happen given the other reviews i figured they were probably ok still and ate them they taste good and i did not get sick so i think that it is fine i would purchase again once i run out 
positive,8/8/20,i bought this because i thought it was the same as white sweet potato flour i was disappointed but then after i baked cookies w it they were actually good gluten free egg free dairy free will taste great though if you added eggs i thought i would share my recipe cup sweet potato flour cup canola oil or safflower cup honey cup water or any other non dairy milk substitute a dash of salt tb baking powder optional chocolate chip cookies shredded coconut and or almond pieces or any other nuts mix everything and roll into small balls flatten on cookie sheet covered with baking sheet bake for minutes or til firm they burn easily so watch 
positive,14/7/21,the ambrosoli honees energy plus vitamin caramels were absolutely delicious you definitely get a caramel taste without the stickiness i cannot speak to the vitamin aspect but it does give you a little energy shake up i kept a pack in my purse and during long tiring speeches i sneaked one and it kept me awake the wrappers are noisy but worth it 
positive,2/12/20,we drink a lot of iced tea in the summer and this is a nice change to put in the rotation so there is a little variety 
positive,20/11/19,this is a very tasty ready to eat indian meal the curry is especially delicious i will likely buy again 
positive,1/3/21,i have been drinking folgers colombian coffee since i first moved to the us over years ago i tried some of the other mass produced coffees first but could not find one that i liked i was thrilled to find this one it tastes perfect to me i had stopped buying it when the price in my local supermarket kept creeping up so i was really happy to find it on amazon subscribe and save cheaper than my local supermarket that is an added bonus the only reason that i gave it four stars is that there are better coffees out there in my opinion just not for the same price 
positive,5/5/21,nice aromas wonderful exotic taste definately for people who like to sample exotic cuisines reminds me of being in southeast asia love it 
positive,2/12/20,i purchased this for one brother on the recommendation of my oldest brother and i could not locate the brand anywhere in my local area so just hoping by chance amazon would have this item i scroll through and bingo the projected delivery date was not going to arrive in time for thanksgiving so i was told but it arrived within two business days my family was very delighted to say the least 
positive,20/11/19,i drink crystal light like it was water this is a good flavor when you want to break out of the ordinary berry orange grape etc it is not too tart like lemonade can be nor too bitter as pomegrante can be i do not drink this flavor every day but it is a nice change from my regular flavors 
positive,9/10/21,this particular flavor is almost impossible to find and in my opinion it is one of the best i was very happy to find it on amazon what cannot you find on amazon this flavor is tart and refreshing just right for arizona summers where i happen to live it is not even halfway through june and the temps are triple digits thank goodness for this wonderful drink which also keeps me hydrated just mix with water and you are good to go 
positive,6/3/21,for whatever reason my local grocer does not carry cinnamon toast crunch i was happy to find it here on amazon the bags of cereal in this box are nice and large this has lasted about as long as regular boxes of cereal and we still have some left i was skeptical about buying cereal this way but it turned out to be a pretty good deal after all 
positive,12/2/21,very hot but smooth great consistancy for use with most korean cusine just a dab will do you do not want too much this items is tasty but extremely hot great side with most korean dishes
positive,2/12/20, crystal light mocktails appletini tastes great it is like drinking a jones soda green apple but without all the carbonation or calories my only issue is that they use aspartame with all the dangers that come with it it would be nice if they use stevia instead other than that if you are looking for a great apple tasting diet beverage this is pretty good 
positive,20/11/19,this is a tad better to me than the mojito flavor it is final mix is a translucent green it is not too sweet but does not have that totally artificial tasting twang to it either i would definitely buy on my own 
positive,25/6/21,i would seen an add for these in a magazine recently but my local grocery store has not had them in stock so i was really glad to get the chance to try the appletini flavor out it is delicious while it certainly does not taste like the real thing it is got a nice light flavor that is different from all the other powdered drink mixes out there also a few reviewers mentioned that it tastes a bit like a jolly rancher in its sourness but i do not think that it is sour at all i try not to drink more than one glass of crystal light a day because i worry about the aspartame in it which this one also has overall a really tasty drink i am eager to try to mojito one next 
positive,17/3/20,i love the sauce with steak i have not tried using it with anything suggested on the bottle yet with a nice filet though delicious 
positive,20/10/21,pretty good sampling of their standard flavors i believe the only flavors missing are the ham ones gravy ham and ham cheese which i would love to try the bacon flavor is good but the bacon is a little odd cheddar cheese is the best and butter is good too plus each pack per box is only calories good for a warm snack when you are feeling nibbly my only real complaint is that i would rather they ditched the original flavor and replaced it with something more interesting 
positive,21/7/20,these are really good and healthy use the subscribe save option because you can always have them skip a shipment or cancel whenever watch the price though as it fluctuates greatly i paid for mine including shipping with subscribe save 
positive,22/2/21,very tasty snack i have re ordered this item twice already too bad the price increased since my last order though 
positive,8/6/21,this is a very good mix at a reasonable price i snack on trail mix at work and put of these out in the snack area with the standard pretzels and candy my fellow employees must have liked since it was gone within a day
positive,2/12/20,ordered this as a healthy snack and everyone seems to like it around my household the packaging was not the best so one bag ripped open during shipment other than that it is all good 
positive,20/11/19,these mints are tasty with a nice kick i cannot chew gum due to jaw pain and really enjoy a mint after eating to freshen up my breath after realizing that many mints contain aspartame which i am trying to avoid these days i searched and found these to my delight i have not seen them in stores so i will be ordering other flavors in the future online 
positive,25/1/21,pros this cereal is great tasting fills you up new box color not like in the picture yellow is a good color protien i am eating it while i type this review cons small ounce boxes how long will that last you do not have any you have to spend money on this when its gone you become very sad your always wanting more but have to wait for the next order stars out of 
positive,1/7/21,found these at meijer s could not wait to try them i think these are better than the regular chocolate ones a much better chocolate flavor love them will be buying these instead of the other ones 
positive,30/9/20,this is the cake part you need to add your own amaretto to it and it really beats making your own 
positive,15/3/20,this is as good as you can get in a commercial product if you like a rich caponata you will like this product 
positive,6/7/21,i wanted something simply convenient to mix up with the spring water hot tap caffe d vita fits the bill i like the pumpkin spice flavor as well as the oz size it is great for a little pick me up on a chilly day 
positive,29/6/21,falling asleep in class staying up late for that end of the year project coffee machine broken or too expensive jolt energy gum gives you energy quickly with a great taste and at a great price you cannot always drink coffee but you can always have a piece of gum i would recommend this product to anyone and everyone i gave out packs of this to a lot of my friends at the end of last semester before finals 
positive,29/6/21,i ordered the pack maybe i just got lucky but i had an excellent variety i have different kinds doubles of the majority with one flavor i got there were probably decafs they were thrown into the box but none were damaged overall i am happy and i will probably order again 
positive,26/7/21,i bought big hunks when i came across them in retail stores which was not very often when i did find them they were usually kind of stale from sitting there for a while i came across this offer on amazon and was impressed with the price so placed an order the box arrived quickly and i was very happy to discover how fresh the candy turned out to be if you like fresh nougat you will probably be very happy with this item 
positive,21/10/21,this a a very tasty product and it makes all beat product taste good i have been a fan of kraft barbecue sauce for years but i just decide to try this brand bulls s eye i am glad i did and i will be switching to this brand from now on 
positive,25/10/21,i love arizona iced tea and this one is quite tasty especially for a diet version a great combination of lemony tea please note that this review is specific to the product not the price or the merchant 
negative,29/6/21,this company protected these cookies very well with great packaging but the taste is not there i would never purchase again 
positive,5/7/21,tried this per package directions adding smoked sausage and cut up chicken tenders wow was it ever good i liked it so much that i immediately came back for another case in the event that this product might be out in the future if you are a fan of jambalya you will love this spicy but not overpowering made a huge amount three of us had dinner with grandson going back for seconds and there was still plenty for the next day for lunch what is so great about this is that you can add anything you want to it and it would be great or fix it as is and still be happy try it 
positive,17/9/21,my husband bought this after growing to love this dish after living back east we currently live in the western us and i have never had this dish prior to him making it for me so i cannot offer any comparison however i do thoroughly enjoy this dish when my husband called this cincinnati chili i got stuck on the chili part so my taste buds were confused when i first tried this dish because it does not particularly taste like the chili i am used to after adjusting to the sweetness i really enjoy this dish more than my husband it is not your typical chili with beans and spicy ness it has a smoother consistency and the cinnamon cloves and allspice give it a different taste entirely it is a very easy meal to make we have it way on top of noodles with grated cheese and chopped onions on top i should also mention to others not familiar with this dish is that it is not very substantial on its own it is also delicious on top of turkey dogs 
positive,18/8/21,i wanted to try cherrytree cola for no particular reason other than i would heard fentimans makes some pretty good drinks so i ordered a few from amazon and they shipped in like three days i absolutely love this soda i do not drink much pop because the carbonation is overbearing for me but this was different it was much smoother than regular colas and had a great taste the only downside is that it is expensive i will not be purchasing more right away but if i could i would 
positive,31/7/21,i have loved these since i was a kid my mom has been giving them to me for christmas ever since i discovered them perfect amount of orange flavor blended in with delicious dark chocolate i had my boyfriend try these recently as well he loves them too he has a mild milk allergy so he sometimes cannot eat certain brands but these do not bother him 
positive,18/10/21,having a peanut allergic son this stuff makes a great substitute texture wise it is exactly like peanut butter but with a slight cinnamon after taste quite pleasant i found it in walmart for under a jar so i would suggest shopping around some i bought the creamy version but a crunchy version was also available also much more cost friendly then the peanut free almond butter that was to be found for like jar
positive,29/6/21,this is by far the best deal going for oh henry bars that i have found anywhere either online or in retail stores an entire pack for under is truly a great bargain and i found the quality and freshness of the bars to be quite good very satisfied with the purchase and i will be re ordering when this box has been devoured 
positive,16/9/21,these sugar free sour gummi worms are wonderful the taste is just like that of the regular sour gummi worms the only problem with them is that they did not come with a suggested serving size as you may or may not know if you eat too much of these or most sugar free products there may be unintended consequences limit to at a time or you may find yourself limited to the bathroom other than that they are great 
positive,24/8/21,i have had instant and canned teas in the past and was less than impressed with those products so i was hoping for something better with the mio sweet tea at first i got the mixture wrong i put tsp into ounces of water there was too much of a citrus like after taste and of course the flavor in general was too strong once i got the mixture right use tsp for every my opinion changed the flavor is great and i love it the servings of this product were gone in no time as i made ounce servings frequently i imagine the liquid would easily stain clothing so be careful as you squirt it out but otherwise i have no reservations in recommending this 
positive,24/6/21,the sweet tea flavor is very tasty and refreshing without any added sugar or calories it is very conveniently packaged for use away from home as well i just pop it in my purse and i am good to go i get to control how much flavor is added according to my taste and mood because it is a liquid there is no concern with additive powders that do not dissolve properly i am a fan 
positive,27/9/21,my wife and i absolutely love these snacks they are somewhat healthy and they are very tasty after we purchased these we found them cheaper at wal mart since then though wal mart went with a cheaper clone from another company it comes in a plastic container has the exact same ingredients and the price is a lot less than the name brand item 
positive,29/6/21,these noodles are very tasty and light not fried or greasy lots of vegies a great lunch to go that will not fatten me up love them 
positive,5/8/21,so often in the movies when something upsetting happens the first thing offered is a cup of tea there is just something soothing about it i am no connoisseur but i decided to branch out and try something a little exotic i am glad i did as this tea is really nice i like mine with a little honey and milk so good 
positive,29/6/21,i bought this after my local coffee house went out of business and it helped me so much with the transition to a coffee free world the mocha mix has a lot of sugar and ingredients i would rather not have on a daily basis but oh it tastes wonderful so for an occasional treat it is awesome i add a small amount to a healthier protein shake and it makes for a great desert 
positive,31/7/21,i personally use it to make iced tea it tastes great with a little sweetner tha acai is not overpowering as in other teas i have tried 
positive,11/9/21,a nice little break from the traditional chocolate mint andes candy the cherry jubilee is not too sweet it is just right package wise i always look at the weight of the candy and not the packaging cannot go wrong with andes it is an office favorite with our software developers 
positive,12/8/21,fruit flavored mentos are a delicious candy the flavor is teriffic although there are several different colors they all taste a bit the same to me which is a general fruit flavor i also really enjoy the texture as well these mints are chewy on the inside but on the outside they have a bit of soft crunchy she will 
positive,31/7/20,i purchased these to add drops of lemon juice to my water they are great i gave it stars because i do not really have anything else to compare it to 
positive,13/6/20,i think the negative reviews are a little harsh this company is not alone in labeling their almonds raw even though they are most likely pasteurized is it right i agree no but when it comes to almond butter no matter what your choices are going to be either organic or not so at least you know they are being grown healthier than the alternative all almonds in the united states are pasteurized you can go to health food co oop store and most likely find imported raw almonds my store has some from italy but if you go to whole foods they are also going to try and sell you raw almonds that are not truly raw everyone seems to be in on the mislabeling anyway google it and get educated if your interested if you are looking for a great tasting organic almond butter at decent price you will not be disappointed with this one as i scanned the negative reviews i do not think i remember them commenting that the taste was not great for what is it is worth i tried vitamixing my imported truly raw almonds to make my own almond butter but still does not taste as good as this 
negative,31/7/20,these beans have absolutely no taste to them be prepared to add butter salt while cooking them and completely ruining the health factor in the process if you plan to enjoy them 
negative,13/6/20,this extract is strange i put a little into my recipe and it sort of had an almost peanut buttery hint of flavor but not quite so i thought it needed a bit more i put in the tiniest bit more and the flavor changed drastically and tasted not like peanut butter but like alcohol not good at all 
negative,26/9/20,looking for no points but this has a funny taste on weight watchers but prefer so will take the pt value
positive,17/10/20,i live in texas while visiting our daughter in sd recently she purchased these at her local grocery store she served as salad topping but then we ate a couple of packages by the handfuls i went back the next morning on our way back home and purchased all they had in the maple and cinnamon flavors i emailed the company and asked where i could buy more locally texas they advised that this is a new product and only available to date in the midwest basically but that i could order through amazon i am thrilled these are fantastic a little on the expensive side but just learn to pace yourself and not eat too many maple is our favorite cinnamon is good too have not tried banana flavor enjoy 
positive,14/12/20,i was introduced to a peach flavored iced latte at work and decided i wanted to try and made them at home this syrup worked great highly recommended 
positive,29/5/20,i love the flavor of this tea even though it is decaffeinated it is one of the few decaf teas that still have a good robust taste this and the irish breakfast decaf are among my favorites 
positive,9/12/20,these are good each roll is only calories with of sugars they are similar in consistency to a rice cake but slightly firmer due to the rice syrup i think they taste sweeter than the of sugars they contain but not so sweet that you would consider them candy or junk they come packaged rolls to a box because they are not individually wrapped they can stick to one another in the package although not to the extent that they are destroyed also because there is no wrapper although they are a decent snack for kids they tend to leave little hands sticky this order was for a dozen boxes these are certainly good enough to order more than once but i imagine it will take some time to get through the initial order a box option might be better 
positive,4/8/20,i love peanut butter but occasionally have allergic reactions after eating it so i avoid it when possible i first purchased sunbutter after seeing it on qvc and boy was it wonderful i purchased it several times through qvc until they quit carrying it fortunately i was able to purchase it again through amazon the pleasant smooth nutty flavor will keep me coming back for more 
positive,31/7/20,this nustevia product is the best i have ever tried there is no bitter taste it is very sweet and only takes a few drops on a previous review i spoke about another product and how tasty it was however this one beats it by a long shot i highly recommend it i am glad i tried this one 
positive,13/6/20,no aftertaste is not overpowering does not mask the flavor of the food we use this on our steel cut oats and protein drinks no bitter aftertaste like the powders 
positive,21/11/20,i made the first loaf of this on a quick setting on my bread machine and it did not rise very high i thought it was the bread mix and was not very happy with it but i decided to give it another try on the regular cycle i added a tablespoon of molasses because we like it in rye bread the loaf turned out beautiful rose very high and tasted delicious very pleased with the results 
positive,25/5/21,this product tastes just like any other cinnamon bun i was skeptic at first but the taste is very good everybody at home liked them at net carbs it is a treat you can afford in your coffee break in your low carb lifestyle 
positive,25/5/21,my wife and i love this coffee the taste is awesome the hint of mocha makes the coffee sooo smooth 
positive,20/1/21,i love sahale snacks and this one hits the mark it is got a little kick that is very satisfying one thing that separates sahale from other snack products is the variety of textures and flavors you get in every bite i highly recommend sing buri blend 
positive,15/1/21,this is really just some good clean tasting hearty tomato sauce the fact that it is organic is important to me and it is also bpa free so if you are concerned do not be top notch product in my opinion and one that i use at least twice a week in pasta and on pizzas the s s price in particular blows away normal grocer prices for this same can size enjoy 
negative,8/2/21,the other reviewers are correct i thought i would buy this in spite of the reviews because it was the only product available without traveling into a bigger town where there are asian markets this is a huge waste of money totally tasteless could not even fix it by adding spices and basil stay away 
positive,10/2/21,this is the best cold tea i have ever had it really works and has a great flavor it gets rid of your cough and makes your throat feel better i have strep right now and this stuff works better than dayquil and does not have any side effects 
positive,9/10/20,the candy was fresh and tasted really good it definitely was not hanging around some warehouse somewhere i would order from this company again with no hesitation 
positive,31/7/20,this is a fantastic product tastes better than mcdonalds or starbucks and less expensive at about per serving it comes in a great canister with a scoop to measure the frappe mix i love it and recommend it to anyone who has a love of frappes 
positive,13/6/20,i can only drink decaf caffiene makes me nuts most decaf teas are flat taste wise this one has a rich distinct flavor i highly recommend it 
positive,5/12/20,this tea is among the best i have ever had i am a tea addict and the delightful licorice flavor running through this tea makes it delicious 
positive,1/11/20,this nori is a true bargain sheets of nori at local grocery stores ran for as much as per sheet sheets at less than is hard to beat really glad i got this as i am now making sushi several times a week 
positive,14/1/21,this nori tastes great at an affordable price this was the best price i have ever seen for a pack this size 
positive,6/6/21,i have never used a coffee syrup but love starbucks and though why not see how close i can get to that wonderful taste i used this torani hazelnut syrup just a small amount in most of my different flavors coffee it is sweet so you do not need any added sugar good price shipping was high but would buy again might try a different flavor 
positive,21/7/20,i must confess that i bought this product only because i wanted to see the pretty flower blossom inside the water to my surprise it smells and tastes really good too and the flower is very pretty totally worth it 
positive,5/1/21,hard to find item delicious and easy to prepare kids love it arrived very fast 
positive,23/1/21,i have been using this flour for the past months or so for making bread and pizza dough and for basically all my baking including cakes it has a great flavor that my family notices my bread comes out perfect each time 
positive,31/7/20,this coffee tastes great i have tried lavazza and other non organic brands but the taste of this coffee is very good and the price is reasonable i will purchase it again 
positive,13/6/20,love these crackers and love i love peanut butter and this is a way to eat it without so many calories these crackers have great flavor just have to remember not to eat whole bag 
positive,1/12/20,sweet and tasty my whole family love it my secondary favorite chocolate brand lindt is always on the top of my list cheaper than lindt 
positive,30/1/21,works great in my iced tea brewing machine that i use in my concession trailer tastes great customers cannot believe that we use lipton tea not some cheap off brand like almost every concession stand uses we only serve our customers the best 
positive,1/1/21,this is a great product if you like a touch of hot on your pasta we first purchased it about years ago when we were in myrtle beach it is hard to find where we live my husband will not eat his pasta withot this i also put a few shakes of it in my sauce when i am cooking it in this quantity it only flavors the sauce and does not make it hot to taste the biggest problem is that it is not often available i wish amazon would stock it on a regulary basis 
positive,11/1/21,i really like the flavor but i do not have much choice anyways not many pizza spices brands out there to buy i used to buy mccourmick but they discontinued their pizza spices i really loved their hot version but i do like this pizza spice anyways i just sprinkle on top of my pizza slice as i am eating it 
positive,31/7/20,i fell in love with this product i find artificial sweeteners sadly lacking in flavor or as stimulating to my taste buds as a flat soda this product has saved me i use it in everything i would use regular sugar for my favorite way to use it is to make lemon sorbet talk about satisfying my sweet tooth and staying within my dietary guidelines this is the one for me now i want to find a brown sugar variation of this raley s supermarket used to carry smart sugar and then quit stocking it i bought every last one on the shelf to tide me over until i could find another source thanks to amazon i can now quit hoarding my supply and use it more freely i will be placing my order for bags very soon thanks to everyone involved in the production of smart sugar 
positive,13/6/20,i have always like sardines and recently decided to start eating them on nearly a daily basis i bought two cases of these season sardines in water and started taking them to work to eat as a snack i really like the taste these came to a can seemed to be of the larger type they still had the skin and bones which was fine by me i love the taste of fish so i did not have much interest in the skinless and boneless bland tasting ones 
positive,14/1/21,i am on my third or fourth bottle am not sure how well the health benefits are working out but i really like it because it adds flavor to different drinks i usually add a little bit to my orange juice or water once a day to give it a nice flavor it probably taste good because it is mostly concentrated pomegranate juice 
positive,7/12/20,wonderful packaging small glass containers full of anchovy goodness that you can throw in the frige after extracting what you need clean tiny boned very edible fillets are perfect for anything from sauce to toppings due to other reviews i recommend using the first fillets you pull out from the middle for sauce slightly broken up the the others come out whole just fine with a cocktail fork i will order these again and again 
positive,5/5/21,had demitris in a restaurant and now it has become the go to for tailgating and gatherings easy to mix and regulate the spiciness only problem was that amazon s packing when shipping caused one bottle to leak all over the box 
positive,23/11/20,bob s red mills lentils are my favorite legume they have a slightly sweet taste and cook very fast minutes be careful not to over cook them because they are very tender and will fall apart still tasty though the soup i make calls for sauteed carrots celery onion add ham or sausage if you wish garlic clove oregano salt if you have not added salty ham and optional hot pepper flakes it is very hardy and filling caution lentils can be difficult for diabetics to handle 
positive,29/8/20,i cannot comment on price because this is not sold locally however i can comment on taste these are so simple to cook and healthy i found a really good lentil soup recipe to use these in 
negative,18/1/21,i was a little disappointed it does not taste like the eel i remembered this is very muschi i do not think i order it again karin
positive,18/6/21,i am a pretty big coffee drinker but had never tried kona coffee before i got to say hawaii roasters kona coffee was the best coffee i ever had the type of coffee you want to savor for the flavor rather than gulp down for the caffeine which is really hard to do because it tastes so good after your first sip you just want to keep downing it rather than savor it i purchased my first package right before the holidays and it was a total hit with my family and friends i am now totally hooked and strongly recommend hawaii roasters kona to all coffee lovers 
positive,18/6/21,love this coffee i have always enjoyed good coffee but this is great coffee a friend sent it to me as a gift and i am so happy he turned me onto it the coffee is strong the way i like it and has a smooth rich flavor i know what i will be buying for my friends this holiday 
positive,7/7/21,this was a gift to our son in law and from what i understand he really enjoyed it rich full bodied flavor 
positive,18/6/21,like most coffee drinkers i know kona is a special coffee bean and this brand offers great taste at my local coffee shop i often pick kona when it is offered as the flavor of the day while the coffee shop kona is better than an average coffee it did not seem to be anything special and i could guess they do not sell true kona but a blend so i decided to try a true kona and picked hawaiian roasters i am very happy with this purchase might be the best coffee i have ever had the flavor is strong and there is no after taste issue i picked the medium roast and i plan to try the dark roast next 
positive,7/7/21,planter s big nut bars are just that big and full of nuts honey roasted peanuts almonds and cashews i often have issues with this kind of snack since they so often try to position themselves as a healthy choice and they so often are not one aside from calling itself a granola bar this snack does not make any particular health claims yet it actually is a relatively good choice very preferable to a candy bar which is really where these types of snacks belong it contains g of fat but almost none of it g is saturated each bar contains no cholesterol a reasonable mg of sodium and calories while providing g of protein g of fiber calcium iron vitamin e and phosphorous like most of these bars there is quite a lot of sugar but again when compared to other candy bars it is not a bad choice and they easily taste as good as most candy bars i would not hesitate to have one of these as an occasional treat 
positive,1/7/21,these bars are pretty tasty as you might imagine they are truly for nut lovers fairly sweet with great nutty flavor it is nice that they do not just use peanuts 
positive,7/7/21,these are vaguely like a payday nuts stuck together with chewy sweet goodness and something vaguely like rice crispies in there they are saltier than i expected though i like that i am not seeing a lot of nuts besides the peanuts though and there is more of the cereal stuff than i was expecting i am a big nut eater so i do like these and i like the salty sweet nutty sticky mess but i think i would prefer them w o the cereal filler 
positive,23/7/21,i was a little hesitant in trying these triple nut bars since i am not a big fan of almonds however i have not found all that many almonds in them plenty of honey roasted peanuts and quite a large amount of broken up cashews i love these i eat them slowly to savor the flavor because they really are good these granola bars are a little larger in size than the standard long by wide by thick just salty enough to make them delicious and sticky enough so it does not break apart when biting into one yet not so sticky that you have to wash your hands after eating i will definitely buy these again 
positive,20/7/21,these are a tasty treat but i would not eat one everyday i like all nuts in bar honey roasted peanuts almonds and cashews i like them separately but having them together blended really nicely i was surprised i was very impressed with the size of the bar compared to other bars they are a generous size i think i will be buying them in the near future great taste and fair size update march i liked these so much i bought more they are not healthy for you but are very tasty i try to eat one every few days 
positive,19/7/21,i like how this bar taste is soft not like other peanut bars that you are afraid that every single bite will hurt i like the flavor of the honey roasted peanuts almonds and cashews combination this bar is delicious 
positive,18/6/21,i am a long time diabetic and always looking for a sweet treat without all the sugar i have always enjoyed haribo gummies so i tried their sugar free version and wow you cannot tell the difference they are still sweet and fruity and smell just the same as a matter of fact so good me kids ate almost all them not many candies i enjoy that are sugar free but these are the ticket 
positive,7/7/21,i am loving this coconut oil it is a difficult thing to find in stores and i have been searching for a good alternative to cooking with olive oil since it has such a low smoke point all the other sites i found it was too expensive so i tried this and have replaced it as my only cooking oil it is light and flavorful and has a lot of health benefits to go with it 
positive,27/6/21,we buy this product to keep us healthier it has a healing property of keeping bacteria at bay especially during the winter months 
positive,21/7/21,first i ordered a case of loma linda vege burger it was disappointing a whoooole case of disappointing i thought that my memories from youth of how good canned vegeburger had been must have been overblown then i tried this worthington vegetarian burger this is exactly what i remembered the big problem is i cannot stop eating it i love eating it straight out of the can the texture is great the flavor is great it crumbles nicely easy to use calories are moderate as well good imitation meats help me resist eating the real thing and this product is perfect for me 
positive,18/6/21,i use to grab my coffees at local stores now do all my coffee shopping here because of price and quanity my wife loves the flavor of this coffee and swears by it i bought the kurig and have to say for time saving and convience it is the best out there it is also the only one that allows you to brew your on blends also try paul newmans organic blend that is my brew 
positive,7/7/21,in my opinion the dha soymilks always taste the best and are the most creamy does not hurt that they are healthy too i usually drink silk brain bone health soymilk at home but was looking for smaller containers to bring to work i tried the zensoy cappuccino flavor and was pleasantly surprised it is very delicious and is a nice change from plain soymilk 
positive,30/6/21,i was weary of buy food through the mail this was a great purchase great taste and great price i will be looking for other great deals 
positive,1/7/21,we are so happy we tried this if you love red lobster biscuits these are the ticket i highly recommend this product wow what a find yummy
positive,24/8/21,i am new to bread making and this was the third loaf of bread i made in my machine toasted with butter this bread is superior to anything i have ever tasted it is the reason i bought a bread making machine 
positive,21/7/21,i have tried other brand of oils but this is the best by far as it makes the popcorn taste better and it is easy to use i always said popcorn will taste great with all the right ingredients 
positive,25/6/21,so far this is the best affordable coffee we found in the us before we had coffee bean direct sumatra mandheling whole bean coffee pound bag which we did not like at all but it still does not reach the coffee we had in europe 
positive,13/9/21,i do not drink much caffeine so i need my spearmint leaves to be pure and not cut with other teas this brand delivers my first order was for packages and i have just completed an order for more for those of you that want a good refreshing spearmint tea i encourage you to give this brand a try 
positive,18/6/21,tasty stuff no complaints other than i wish you could pick amongst the selections and perhaps avoid the peppered flavored one in favor of a different one 
positive,7/7/21,if you like sriracha this is definitely the cost effective way to order it with free shipping from amazon prime each of these oz bottles actually costs a little less than the oz bottles from the store 
positive,15/7/21,i purchased these cracker chips at walmart twice and now i cannot find them and they have no idea what i am talking about love them and have some coupons but cannot find them now i will continure to look trying to be healthy and these are great

positive,6/7/21,this is not as hot as some of the hot sauces i have tried however this one has the best taste for the scovel units so this is the best bang for the heat and flavor combined you will not find anything hotter with this kind of flavor great stuff 
positive,18/6/21,i was purchasing nutritional yeast at whole foods but the cost was too high bob s red mill makes a great nutritional yeast and the price is right 
positive,7/7/21,this product does taste like sugar the only reason i gave it stars is the price it really is very expensive so i keep trying other sugar substitutes to see if i could find a cheaper alternative so far i have not found anything that is close to this there is no after taste but start off using only a little because you might get stomach upset diarrhea then increase little by little so your system has time to get use to it 
positive,27/7/21,i use this tea mostly for making large pitchers of iced tea mix in a little mint and chamomile and you have a mocktail that cannot be beat 
positive,13/7/21,this is the best black tea i have ever had that came out of a teabag it has a distinct and rich tangy flavor that is almost reminiscent of an expensive bourbon most other brands seem highly unsatisfactory after getting used to this delicious tea so i plan to keep some around all the time it is a little expensive but nowhere near as expensive as going to a cafe or tea house to get a great cup of tea 
positive,13/9/21,i got this tea a few days ago and it has great taste has a mild citrus taste love love love will come back in weeks to review the weight loss aspect as today is my first day update almost weeks later i am still totally in love with this tea and i actually noticed that it suppresses appetite great i have been losing weight but i cannot totally attribute it to this tea as i have also been exercising more but the appetite suppression is a great attribute for me

positive,10/3/21,nice and easy to use perfect for making almond milk the mesh is very fine so the milk comes out very smooth i would highly recommend this product 
positive,17/4/21,both my husband and year old have a gluten allergy we have tried other products and found that these taste the best for animal crackers it is not grainy or taste funny like another reviewer stated it taste more like a butter cookie yummy not sure why anyone would rate it one star i understand personal preference to taste and texture like one reviewer but the other reviewer just seemed to be on a rant we have been pleased with this product and highly recommend it to others who are looking for a tasty gluten free snack 
positive,21/1/21,great item and great service this gum is really hard to find in my area and it is a favorite of ours we have ordered this a couple of times and i order this as soon as i run out and i am always pleased thanks
positive,30/1/21,this is my favorite flavor of microwave popcorn you do not get that creepy fake butter taste it tastes like the kind my dad made on the stove when i was a kid with oil and salt 
positive,13/2/21,great taste different than any ice tea we have had kids love it all natural sugar will buy again
positive,15/1/21,a very good tasting yogurt starter at a good price that can be made without using any sugar easy to use in conjunction with an electric yogurt maker 
positive,6/3/21,this tea is really tasty and at a great price i will be ordering more that is for sure since i really do not have anything else to say but this stupid thing will not allow me just to keep it simple i have to add words to make it over twenty hope you are not as irked by this as i am 
positive,8/6/21,this coating has just enough seasoning to make fried chicken very tasty the flavor does not overwhelm it makes it easy to make fried chicken at home 
positive,7/1/21,the package arrived promptly and the chocolate brought a smile to my mother s face awesome chocolate and highly recommend it 
positive,17/4/21,bought this flavor for the first time i was very happy with the taste i will be buying it again 
positive,10/3/21,the dogs loved them i will certainly order these again they are wholesome and not made in china which is very important
positive,14/1/21,i was hesitant buying so much of this before i had even tasted it but it has a great flavor which is really all you can expect from an energy gel in my opinion i had previously only bought the orange flavor so now i have a new flavor that i can depend on 
positive,24/5/21,i have never needed to use these for energy as i never feel drained but my brother recommended them saying he takes one before and every half hour of his runs i still have not noticed a difference but when i start running over maybe i will need it 
positive,14/10/21,but i ran out and now i see that the price has increased from to while it is still i am sure a good deal that is a sharp increase 
positive,7/2/21,i just got my first case and let it get cold in the fridge for a couple days drank my first bottle tonight and let me tell you it tastes like water i did not detect any dirty taste or even an aftertaste i do not understand what people are saying it tastes funky because all i drink is water and milk this tastes like my bottled regular water i am going to switch to bottles of blk water a day and see if it really makes me feel any better and energized 
positive,29/3/21,i do not know what everyone is freaking out about it tastes like slightly salty smart water the color is a little unnerving at first looks like rust water a friend of nutrition major likes the idea of it so i cannot be that bad maybe
positive,17/4/21,very tasty crackers especially for gf not many crackers in the box but if you are buying gf products you probably already know that my whole family likes them i bought a couple of cases last time to save money on shipping fyi they make a great substitute for bread crumbs in meatloaf and parmasean chicken 
positive,10/3/21,these vegetable flavored crackers are a pleasant surprise for those of us who are gluten sensitive they have an almost pizza like fragrance and taste very nice indeed as a veteran of sampling rice crackers cakes etc as well as crackers of other grains i must say this glutino texture is much preferable to the hard crackle rice flour gives to crackers and too the flavor is quite good i have subscribed to have them delivered as a result 
positive,10/7/21,this is our favorite jerk sauce and it was sent correctly and speedily by the merchyant so all is well 
positive,27/1/21,i actually loved this flavor i bought one of each of argo tea flavors from my local store i liked this one the most i am not sure what kind of tastes the other two reviewers have but i am amazed that they hated it so much the mint and lime mix together wonderfully it might even mix well with gin i noticed the mint flavor at first followed by a tart lime flavor at the end i will be buying more according to the bottle its made with armeniam mint tea not black tea as one of the reviewers noted 
positive,1/6/21,my sister was sick with terminal cancer and was suffering from a poor appetite she had this juice in the hospital and liked it it was not available for sale locally i emailed apple and eve and they very nicely responded that it was available from amazon i ordered it and it was delivered promptly to her house 
positive,20/8/21,this is a very good tasting salt especially on freshly popped popcorn i use it in everything i no longer use the regular table salt becuase this just really enhances food without the metallic taste of table salt or the somtimes to salty taste table salt has you will think your food was prepared by a fine dine chef buy a non corrosive grinder to use this salt and you will never use table salt again 
positive,14/8/21,good overall oil for salads cooking etc we have benn buying it from on amazon for a couple of years now and are on auto ordering which is even a little cheaper making it a great deal
negative,21/4/21,this oil tastes very bitter i ordered this because it had good reviews so i do not know if it is old bad or in a contaminated tin 
positive,1/4/21,i love this stuff the newer bottles do not look like this but its so filling and delicious carrot juice is my super food
positive,17/4/21,what more can you say than it tastes great amazon had a good deal on this when i ordered it over a year ago 
positive,10/3/21,i have been using walden farms products since the company came to north america and they are a regular part of my shopping list their pancake syrup is thick and fantastic this is so versatile and great on salmon maple glazed chicken turkey etc in chili and stews instead of molasses great in butternut carrot pumpkin pureed soups in milkshakes on toast french toast biscuits bread puddings or breakfast bakes on eggs pancakes high fiber cereal in puddings hot and cold cereals desserts ice cream souffles and in steamed milk and hot coffee this is great on waffles or to bake with great for cakes muffins etc i love pouring it on top of crumb cakes and letting it soak in i especially love mixing it into greek yogurt or cottage cheese adding it to pumpkin puree with some cinnamon pumpkin pie spice and sweetener makes it tastes like pumpkin pie in a bowl but healthy great way to have flavor without the added sugar 
positive,22/4/21,this is such a good tasting syrup that when they stop selling it in the nc stores i seek amazon and is very impressed with the price 
positive,25/4/21,the first time i ate it i did not realize that the beans sunk to the very bottom so when i was almost done all i had left were a bunch of beans from then on i made sure to stir it up occasionally and really enjoyed the mixture of vegetables 
positive,1/4/21,when i decided to become veggie my boyfriend frowned he figured that we would be giving up on all these foods that he likes i made these sloppy joes for him though and he could not even tell the difference we are talking about a guy who likens eating vegetables to having teeth pulled i figure that he if he can eat them and ask for them again anybody would like them 
positive,30/6/21,pro this coffee is great it is one of the better ones i have tried and i have tried over brands overall i would give it a rating from to would highly recommend con i feel it is a bit pricey 
positive,1/3/21,i liked the size of the mini fingers walker s shortbread though not more than one or two bites for each one they r mighty tasty 
positive,29/1/21,it is hard to describe this to people who have never sampled it but basically it is a powder to which you mix milk and sugar to get a sweetened malted drink it is supposed to promote sleep quite simply it is a comfort drink when plain milk just will not do you can also call it malted milk or a hot sweet malt drink in the great british trifecta of british powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar horlicks the most malty milo is medium chocolately and malty and ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately it is actually named after the inventor william horlick as far as taste goes you can make it as malty or sweet as you like depending on how much of each you add to the milk but to those who love and grew up on holicks it is just a great comfort drink 
positive,17/4/21,this is a great tasting hot drink it is not chocolate base like milo or ovaltine when added to milk the color of the milk barely changes it gives the milk a smooth texture and a creamy taste i mix tbs with warm milk sometimes i use sugar and sometime i do not without sugar added it still has a good taste the only thing is the container is very small i was expecting something a little bigger for if i knew was so small in size i would have order the larger size here is the nutritional fact base on serving calories sodium mg total fat g potassium mg saturated g total carbs g polyunsaturated g dietary fiber g monounsaturated g sugars g trans g protein g cholesterol mg vitamin a calcium vitamin c iron 
positive,10/3/21,this is a very welcome product it is so difficult today to find any candies that are made without gmo s having said that i must also say that i was astounded at the price listed i purchased these candies in a local supermarket for a bag that is three not thirty when you add shipping unreal s website lists many stores that will soon be carrying these products they are great everyday type candies i would recommend to anyone but not at the price listed 
positive,30/5/21,this is the best kcup ever it is fantastic sweet it does not have to much caffine but just enough the flavor is fantastic great price 
positive,28/9/21,these are by no means low cal but they have g protein and taste really good better than a lot of the vitamin tasting bars i have had they are huge so i half it and eat one half now and the other later on or another day i am eager to try the triple chocolate flavor the sugar grams is per bar that is why i only eat half at a time fiber is just grams per bar 
positive,6/5/21,i got these and another brand at the same time i far preferred the taste of this pouch than the other brand my daughters love these snacks and i love how easy they are to just grab when in a hurry i am also excited to pack them when we go on picnics my year old and my month old are able to slurp these up in just seconds but they enjoy each and every second of it i am curious though if anyone knows are these pouches bpa free everything else about them is so good that i would hope they would be but it does not say it anywhere on them so my assumption would be that they are not bpa free otherwise that would be a high marketing point 
positive,20/4/21,i love this water it is liquid gold i bought ten cases a year ago and have been giving bottles of trivedi water as gifts to family and friends since then it makes a wonderful gift each person has had their unique experience with it i am thrilled it is available on amazon now i can use it and share it more freely i have used trivedi water on plants with great success most recently i started using it on my skin wow it is clearing up acne and revitalizing my skin in a way i could not have imagined truly amazing and in terms of drinking trivedi water the taste is indescribable the closest i could say is that it tastes like pure water from a mountain stream fresh clear and vital with a quality of softness to it it quenches some taste or thirst that is deeply satisfying try it 
positive,20/4/21,i would like to share with you who are contemplating mr trivedi s products i was diagnosed with are rare form of acid reflux i was advised not to drink anything carbonated and a whole list of no no s about months ago i found out about this incredible water since then that is all i drink i had the most amazing results not only easing my acid reflux but also drinking the water brings a sense of calmness and almost at the same time a felling of complete happiness and tolerance of which i am not especially noted for at the retreat one of the wonderful staff members remembered me from the center in soho she remarked how different and calmer i was compared to months ago i know there will always be skeptics i am ready for them thank you mr trivedi
positive,21/4/21,this water is the best tasting water i have ever had i used it on a plant that had some leaves looking limp and now the plant looks like new i notice an energy difference each time i drink some love it 
negative,2/5/21,based on the reviews i ordered a pack of these bad idea we have tried a number of different varieties of pods these are by far the worst this stuff is so bad no one here will drink it you might want to buy one bag and try it before ordering a pack 
positive,25/5/21,these bars are very good for you with an awesome taste i love them i try to eat one for breakfast every day and already have lost a little weight i would not recommend eating more than per day because of the fiber well you know but they are delicious peanut butter is not my favorite flavor but is very good i love the caramel ones the best

positive,25/5/21,you do not have to use the beer can method this seasoning is great in many ways to cook chicken 
positive,22/5/21,i love how these mints taste compared to the classic peppermint flavor which i used before they are a bit less strong and spicy they taste very sweet and still give off a great minty scent and they do not get the horrible sour aftertaste that classic altoids do i love these mints 
positive,19/7/21,the regular shirmp noddle soup s taste is very good and this spicy srimp flavour has a better taste i like it 
positive,7/9/21,very well balanced flavor with no after taste syrup does have the tendency to drip down the side while pouring so you may want to get a pump 
positive,25/8/21,amazing coconut flavor and very easy to make this was the flavor i have made and all came out better then expected 
positive,6/9/21,this product has a kick to it which you cannot usually find with other hot mustard brands but pay attention the jars are very small
positive,25/5/21,i received these pistachios as a christmas present they are fantastic i cannot seem to stop eating them and neither can anyone else in the family my adult son had never tried pistachios before eating these and now loves them too i will definitely be ordering more of these 
positive,7/9/21,this is an amazing biscuit my all time favorite it is sweet but not too sweet that is the best part crunchy biscuits are grounded and that is this product i like to have it with milk or with juice it is very nutritious few spoons of ground plazma lane biscuits and a cup of milk make a very tasty breakfast we make sure that we always have few boxes of this biscuits in the home everyone enjoys it grownups and kids to make delicious cake add juice orange or strawberry are my favorites to lane biscuits add little by little juice so that you do not end up making it too liquidish shape it as desired add whip cream and your cake is done plazma and lane biscuits from bambi company are the same biscuit same cookies same company is making them just name of cookies is different

positive,19/6/21,i have been using rendered duck fat from another company that is times as expensive but not any better i use it to make a chicken liver pate that convinces even the best palletes that it is duck liver pate this is enough duck fat for about pounds of raw livers depending upon your fat tollerance my secret pate recipe ounces rendered duck fat lb chicken livers large shallot peeled and coarsely chopped tablespoons tsp herbs de provence rosemary marjoram thyme work well cloves garlic peeled and crushed through a press tsp sea salt tsp freshly ground black pepper tbs cognac or dry sherry one loaf of rye or pumpernickel bread look for this at the deli counter olive oil garlic salt pate fry the first six ingredients until the livers are cook thoroughly allow mixture to cool slightly so you do not melt your food processor add cooked mixture to food processer and blend away adjust seasoning and add cognac cool in refrigerator bread heat oven to coat bread slices with olive oil and place in a single layer on a sheet pan sprinkle with garlic salt these cook quickly so check them after minutes you want a hard crouton like doneness

positive,10/1/21,my family likes sour items so be forewarned it is definitely sour but the flavors are so very good i have had other otter pops and as you suck on them the flavor gets sucked out and you are left with an unflavored chunk of ice but these are definitely not like that great product and the only way i can find them is here on amazon because i am to isolated to find them in stores 
positive,26/3/21,caused a fight over who was getting what lol perfect gift and have told many others to check out this box and the others they have available very quick delivery
positive,24/3/21,i have been drinking peppermint tea for about year in fact my family used to grow and harvest peppermint tea from our own patch to me this tea tastes great and has a good minty kick to it i would certainly purchase this again i use a little mesh tea ball infuser and pack it full regardless of the size cup i use at this moment i am drinking a cup and the strength is good i declare this a phenomenal value 
positive,24/2/21,although this is no substitute for the real thing the flavor is good enough when you need a substitute 
positive,19/2/21,these work great with s mores i was so shocked they are a little thicker and not as cloyingly sweet as non gluten free grahams but i found that refreshing because they are thicker they stand up to smushing the marshmallow and chocolate in between each cracker better than regular grahams which can fall apart i would highly recommend 
positive,14/12/20,i have not yet tried these crackers with s mores but they are very good with any kind of frosting especially cream cheese frosting a nice quick treat that is gluten free 
positive,19/10/21,mmm this boxed macaroni and cheese kit is great the cheese sauce is smooth and creamy and there is just enough ro tel included to give the mac some kick without making it runny as a bonus it only takes about mins to prepare note the ro tel is not mixed in with the cheese sauce so you can add as much or as little of the tomato sauce as you would like to the mac or just skip it and use it in another dish you could just add the tomato sauce to your portion if the kiddies do not like tomatoes note one box only makes servings unless you have tiny eaters try it 
positive,18/5/21,these are wonderful they have a great light sweetness and real chocolate flavor their consistency is that of hard candy not like a melty chocolate just what i wanted i keep them in my bag and use them to stave off afternoon munchies great for diabetics and hypoglycemics 
positive,19/2/21,i love indian food and this is a great way to get great tasting indian food quickly and easily the aloo palak tastes amazing and it is so easy to prepare especially when i do not feel like cooking just take the package out and heat it in the microwave the pouches are usually good for two people and taste great with rice also the aloo palak is a tiny bit spicy which i love but know some people cannot handle 
positive,14/12/20,i bought this for my girl friend that recently went through gastric bypass and she is a pretty picky person when it comes to food and surprisingly she loves the product and drinks like shakes everyday 
negative,1/6/21,when i ordered i did not realized this item was seasoned it is i do not like the taste i wanted plain organic mashed potatoes i got boxes of these be careful what you order in grocery 
positive,1/4/21,you have created a product which is low in fat and calories and high in taste thank you for the bulk pack 
positive,15/4/21,i purchased this based on the hugely positive reviews and for the promise of having a tasty alternative to regular peanut butter i was amazed at how good it was definitely buying this again 
positive,19/5/21,i bought this product because i am on a medically supervised liquid diet this product was recommended for adding low calorie low fat flavor to the shakes i am drinking it is very tasty and adds great flavor i have heard that you can add water and make a sort of peanut butter but i have not tried that i think it would also be excellent in baked goods too this product also comes in a chocolate flavor which is very good also 
positive,19/2/21,i am kind of a noodle bowl connoisseur i have eaten lots of different ones at lunch over the years the flavor of these bowls are noticeably better than other brands needless to say i am a big fan the bowls have enough food to fill me up fine but probably will not satisfy my husband also its not very spicy i always end up adding a good amount of sriracha but that is just me i recommend 
negative,14/12/20,strong aftertaste and not a pleasant one will try other powdered milk product did not order online purchased from local grocery 
positive,28/7/21,first let me state that i do not enjoy drinking soymilk i buy this for my son for traveling and out and about that being said when i tasted this brand it was actually good it has a nice sweet vanilla y flavor without the almost bitter taste that most soymilk has 
positive,29/6/21,this black walnut has excellent flavor my ice cream was wonderful i was unable to locate this in any stores i also purchased the bourbon vanilla waiting to try that the ingredients were simple water alcohol black walnut 
positive,15/10/21,i first purchased these at an area supermarket and fell in love with them right away very pleasant taste and perfect blend of spices if you enjoy cool ranch doritos then i think you will enjoy these chips i do not eat gluten free foods exclusively however these are the only chips i eat 
positive,20/7/21,these chips are fantastic they have just the right amount of spice and crispness these are probably my favorite chip on the market 
positive,12/10/21,i use this as one of my herbal teas on the hcg protocol it is smooth and tastes good no noticable side effects would recommend i v drank almost half the box now and i actually brew it in my coffee maker in the mornings wonderful will repurchase shipping fast and item as described
positive,19/2/21,this is great for graham cracker crust i made a cheesecake and my gluten eating husband raved about it cannot wait to make another pie with it 
positive,14/12/20,on a whim because i was out of salad dressing i decided to give this a try being calorie free and sugar free i did not hold much hope for this but i can say that it is incredible i use it in tuna on salads salmon and as a marinate with some balsamic vinegar i love to really dress my salads so now i can do it guilt free 
positive,2/7/21,a bit pricey but has a great taste love it in my tea and i use it in my deep conditioners for my hair 
positive,11/3/21,i decided to try raw honey about a year ago and was a bit overwhelmed with all the choices i ended up at my local health food store and found stakich raw honey it is produced about an hour from me so given the speculation that raw honey from flora in your area helps with allergies and liking to support local businesses i decided to give it a try i love it the taste is delicious and sweet i have used it to replace all of our regular honey uses and no one in my family can tell the difference the texture is definitely more grainy than processed honey but that is to be expected i mix a tablespoon of stakich raw honey and a teaspoon of stakich bee pollen into my greek yogurt each morning and start my day with a nutritious and delicious breakfast try it you will not be disappointed 
positive,10/4/21,these chips have so much chile lime flavor it is amazing baked wheat does not have as many calories as regular chips and not greasy at all i live in hawaii and the stores do not stock them here so i have to order from amazon thank god for amazon 
positive,22/7/19,i grew up eating red vines and i liked them very much but it is been ages and ages since i have eaten licorice i do not why i do eat candy on occasion but licorice i just stopped eating until last week when i tried these they do kind of remind me of red vines the flavor is different of course then i remember these are pomegranate flavored but it is been ages and ages plus years since i have eaten a pomegranate so i cannot swear that they have gotten the flavor right but that being said these are very tasty 
positive,2/2/20,these naturally flavored twists are healthier and tastier than the more popular type out there on the market which taste like plastic i was hoping not to find corn syrup in these twists but these days it is almost impossible to find man made snacks without it ingredients organic wheat flour organic sugar corn syrup organic tapioca syrup vegetable glycerin sunflower oil elderberry extract citric acid natural flavor pomegranite juice concentrate licorice root extract made in mexico so much for being newman s own 
positive,2/2/20,i really like this licorice it has a great flavor does it taste like pomegranate i do not really know what a pomegranate is supposed to taste like so cannot really answer if that is the flavor i am tasting but if you are looking for a licorice with a nice berry flavor that does not turn your tongue colors this is it i also like that it is from newman s own i always purchase their products as i know it is going towards charity 
positive,31/8/19,i have never tried the similar candies before so maybe i have nothing to compare these with but i really enjoyed them it is not too sweet and just has a pleasant taste overall i think i will be buying these candies for myself in the future i tried newman s own other products and i am happy that this one has not dissappointed me 
positive,22/7/19,this licorice is addictive the taste is original and fresh what i love the best is the after taste it leaves you wanting more a winner 
positive,12/1/20,i am already a fan of newman s own organics line of products i think they are generally high quality reasonably priced and have a great track record as a charitable organization so i was really looking forward to trying out the pomegranate licorice when you first open the package you can immediately smell the sweet sugary fruit scent of pomegranate the next thing you notice is the rich red well pomegranate color one thing i liked right off the bat is that the licorice sticks are not super long like a twizzler they are shorter and more manageable to eat they are a also not overly sticky and do not leave a sticky residue on your fingers taste wise they are great perhaps my favorite aspect of this licorice is that they are not super sweet while they have a strong sugary smell they are not obnoxiously sweet like twizzlers the licorice has a nice chewy texture and trends towards soft the pomegranate taste is subtle at first you cannot taste it at all instead tasting the sugar and gelatin flavors as you chew the pomegranate taste grows and by the end has a nice strong flavor the pomegranate flavor is also very good i have not ate too many raw pomegranates but i do like the pom juice products this licorice compares well against the pom juice products so as a nice treat to share with the family i highly recommend 
positive,19/2/20,i would been reading about this product in magazines for almost a year and could not wait to try it i finally got to and it did not disappoint pomegranate is not an easy flavor to capture and somehow they were able to i have tried all the newman s own organics licorices and this was the hardest in terms of chewing but it was not overly hard i have had some that i know would put any dental work at risk and this is a good option if you like slighly harder licorice but still want something that is chewy not too sweet but good if you need a candy fix and of course it is got all natural ingredients so you can get your candy fix as i have been doing without feeling in the least bit guilty 
positive,27/11/19,newman s own organics licorice twists have a lot of things going for them percent organic with no artificial ingredients the pomegranate flavor was surprisingly good and while it had a different consistency from the twizzlers i am used to it was not a bad change recommended 
positive,12/12/19,well licorice is a stretch but this is like most of the newman products tasty and good quality whether you like the taste is of course up to you but i did 
positive,26/9/20,this licorice has a very good flavor the only thing i would have liked is it were a little softer 
positive,22/7/19,we enjoyed our package of pomegranate licorice i prefer to buy organic and this fits the bill it is not too sweet but yet still is candy the entire family enjoyed it and it was a nice special treat if you are looking for a nice treat that is not too sweet and sugary this works i would prefer that they did not use corn syrup but it is candy 
positive,2/2/20,my husband loves his florida orange blossom honey he was delighted when i found it through amazon now he does not have to wait for care packages from his brother who lives in orlando pros real florida orange blossom honey price quick shipping cons none
positive,23/5/20,this can be mixed with virtually any wine i have had it mixed with champagne riesling and moscato and it works well with them all the price is rather steep as i paid at a local gift shop 
positive,22/11/20,i have to quit drinking coffee as i have horrible caffiene reactions i love the taste of coffee though i have tried hazelnut and mocha so far and both are tasty hazelnut has a bit stronger flavor but mocha is good too even my kids liked it when they tasted it i think its a great alternative and better for you 
positive,30/3/20,i love this stuff you can make it with milk or almond milk and put some whipped cream on top it is amazing you can also blend it with ice to get a frap style drink 
positive,8/7/20,great taste and texture especially considering it is sugar free is a perfect size to have it finished in on seating 
positive,4/1/20,i switched to green tea several years ago after reading about the health benefits of green tea vs regular brewed tea after trying many different brands i settled on celestial seasonings green tea because of its rich tea flavor finding it on amazon was a plus i now have it on auto ship and never run out of tea 
positive,30/1/21,my son gobbled this down right away i was looking for different flavors since they only hold so many in the stores texture is fine what else can i say tastes good to me too 
positive,2/11/20,this is a great tasting product it does not have any sugar it flows just like honey 
positive,17/10/20,these pepper flakes have a rich slightly acidic flavor and not a lot of heat they have a slightly moist consistency not sure if that will affect shelf life shipping was fast but overly expensive 
positive,22/7/19,these are the best tasting of the crown prince offerings for sardines in olive oil 
positive,2/2/20,i love them and cannot find them in stores around here so was happy to find them on amazon better than just a salad topper i crush them and add the to rice for flavor plus use them as a crumb topping on many dishes 
positive,4/10/20,this mint is very minty it has a stronger mint flavor than the one with sugar only problem it is not carried by my local stores 
positive,1/4/20,the molasses dominates the mix and the chipotle does not assert itself as much as i would have liked but all in all it is a passable barbecue sauce it goes especially well mixed into a pot of baked beans 
positive,8/5/20,this tea has a wonderful flavor the price is right and i love that they do not use staples on the bags i can just throw the used ones right into the compost pit jasmine and green tea were meant to be together 
positive,18/6/20,i actually have tried four flavors to date of the di vinci syrups i like them all i use them in baking you can find some recipes on the internet for using these syrups in things like muffins etc be aware that these syrups are made with splenda we love splenda use it everyday so we are ok with it some folks have a problem with it though currently in my pantry i have strawberry i suggest using this over some low fat frozen yogurt or ice cream vanilla peanut butter and pancake syrup all four taste great the consistency of the pancake syrup is thinner than you might want however i bought it because my local store did not have syrup made with splenda at the time now they do though the price listed here is good i have paid per bottle at an online retailer 
negative,20/8/20,first i would like to say that i purchased this product from the store not from this seller also that there was not a problem with the expiration date of the coffee i am not a picky coffee drinker i like all kinds but i prefer stronger brews i like flavored coffee as well but only when it tastes like what it is suppose to i do not think anyone wants to drink chemical flavored coffee when i bought this product i thought it was going to be great i am a consumer of folgers and have tried different flavors of theirs however this was the first k cup brand i bought from them and was very disappointed the coffee is definitely flavored and does taste like caramel but after each sip there is an after taste of some sort of chemical the after taste is so strong and disgusting that you can neither enjoy the flavor of the coffee nor the caramel for the first time was unable to finish my cup of coffee to drink the entire cup would have been the equivalent of torturing myself i would not recommend anyone buy this product 
positive,1/6/21,i stopped in the cayman islands and fell in love with this rum cake it makes a great gift too 
positive,4/7/21,tasty moist not too sweet just perfect it its true rumcake the taste of rum is minimul however it is there just enough 
positive,5/2/20,i am french and moved to usa in i miss many of the good foods i have in france the ricola herbal tea is one of them i am glad to discover recently that amazon sells it it might be the only place in usa that sells it it is calming soothing and taste good it is good when you are thirsty right before going to bed when you are sick and when you have a throat ache 
positive,22/7/19,i do not generally care too much for the healthy alternatives especially when it comes to coffee however after trying truvia at a hotel i am now hooked i usually get it at the grocery store but it is good to see that it is available on amazon and now that i have prime i might just be getting it online instead this sweetener tastes really good and in addition to coffee i have had it with desserts and it tastes great i think it even tastes better than sugar and definitely tastes better than splenda i cannot comment as to the health aspects related to artificial sweeteners but i am sure that there is plenty of information available on the internet related to that as a casual coffee drinker i highly recommend truvia however definitely try out a sample before purchasing such a large box 
positive,2/2/20,these are fantastic i have gone through about bags in the last couple months try putting out a bowl of these rather than pretzels or chips they have got a hint of saltiness to them so they go great with beer the bulk box of bags is also the most economical purchase i have found 
positive,22/11/20,did not know what to expect when i ordered this product but was pleasantly surprised about how good it is and the value definitely will buy again 
positive,1/3/20,finally i found a whole bag of only grape jolly ranchers they are delicious and have been rather popular in my candy jar in my office lots of thieving coworkers for or these and cherry was a bit steep but i think i am ahead in the end for not throwing away all the undesired flavors in the multi flavor bags 
positive,23/11/20,i bought these for my husband it is almost impossible to find sugarless black licorice in stores he is thrilled with these fast shipping highly recommend 
positive,5/4/21,although it is low acid it is still good tasting and it does not because me heartburn i no longer have to take prilosec daily i would definitely order some more of this coffee i receommend it to fellow heartburn sufferrers 
positive,27/4/20,i like the coconut oil very much it taste good i add it to my food everyday will buy again
positive,8/3/21,i could not be happier i was worried the expiration date would be a problem nope march of i was worried the milk would taste funny nope it is the best milk i have ever had thanks for offering this at a great price 
positive,30/1/20,great product easy to have on hand my year old thinks it is fun to have a milk box 
positive,22/7/19,love the fact that i finally found organic sunflower seeds i toast them with just a hint of sea salt 
positive,2/2/20,for a low gluten product this stuff is very good it holds up well in liquid does not get all mushy i like the bits of dried fruit i add stevia for sweetness 
positive,2/9/20,great jam spicey crisp just a little sweet maybe not the best for breakfast but perfect for afternoon tea 
positive,26/1/21,simply put this tea is delicious the mango taste is smooth and not overwhelming and all the ingredients are blended well so nothing is overpowering i also like the fact that numi did not pump tons of sugar into the tea to make it overly sweet thereby cutting down on calories carbs and sugar as the label indicates this is barely sweetened but it tastes just right there are also little gems of wisdom underneath the bottle caps i cannot wait to try every flavor in this line of puerh teas in the glass bottle i did not order the tea through amazon rather i got it directly through the numi tea website but wanted to give a review here for others 
positive,9/1/21,these taste great i add or cubes to the water when cooking quinoa or lentils and it really adds a nice depth of flavor i use them often 
positive,30/7/21,these pancakes get my highest rating for gluten free pancakes they taste almost identical to bisquick pancakes they are so yummy i will never make gf pancakes from scratch again 
positive,30/10/20,i started drinking the blueberry hibiscus tea because i read that hibiscus helps to reduce blood pressure i have never been a hot tea drinker until about a month ago it did take me a few cups to get used to the taste now i really enjoy the taste i even miss it when i skip my nightly cup i find it also relaxes me before bed it is sweet enough that there is no need to add honey or other sweetener the blueberry is an added bonus i am willing to pay the steep price because i am trying to find something beside prescription medication to help control my out of control blood pressure the price on amazon is a bit higher than at whole foods where i shop 
positive,3/8/20,in the great trifecta of british powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar horlicks the most malty milo is medium chocolately and malty and ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately all are basically comfort drinks when plain milk just will not do all are powders to which you add milk and sugar to get a sweet malty drink the latter two with chocolate flavor as well i love all drinks but if you are drinking this for nostalgia s sake make sure you get the milo from where ever your nostalgia springs from because milo is made in different countries and they all taste a little different for me i love milo for it is good mix of chocolate and malt not too much of either and a great comfort drink for cold nights 
positive,29/1/21,not the sweetest chickpeas i have ever had but close enough nice flavor and texture very fresh no old beans cooked up great very pleased 
positive,24/10/21,reese s sugar free peanut butter cups taste just like the regular ones plus they are lower in sugars and are healthier great prices on amazon too 
positive,24/10/21,my daughter really likes ave candy bars and they are hard to find in our area amazon has them and they came quickly thanks for the good service 
positive,16/10/21,this was one of the first k cup boxes i bought was not disappointed it tastes great like coffee is supposed to not too strong not too weak great flavor will be buying more 
positive,24/10/21,very cool and smooth tasting the kind of snack that works any time and place right on time and very affordable i enjoy this a great deal 
positive,25/9/21,this a delicious grape juice it is good for anytime of the day and it is healthy for you and your children i highly recommend this for all kids and adults please try this out 
positive,19/10/21,i really enjoy these bars i usually will have to of bar at a time gives me energy until next meal love the taste and crunch 
positive,20/10/21,interesting concept very tasty too i used the chocolate in my vanilla ice cream and it was a lean alternative to flavored syrups i purchased these products to cut down on the fat from regular peanut butter i would order it again although it is a bit pricey 
positive,19/10/21,first of all i just want to say that i hate lollipops and i do mean hate even dumdums seem to taste really artificial and just like colored sugar i got these originally because i was intrigued by the organic label i love that you can actually understand what is in these items and they have a video showing it being made great unique taste as well definitely well worth the price my family and friends love it the assortment is great and they actually taste like different things rather than a lot of candy that is out there 
positive,15/6/21,i bought this to share with my co workers and in one week they are gone 
positive,4/8/21,these lollipops are a wonderfully healthy option over regular store brand suckers lollipops my children and i are very happy with the taste of these the flavors we have tried so far are tasty and strong and the size is perfect for a special treat the pound bag should last us a very long time 
positive,4/8/21,these are the best lollipops i have ever had sadly they are not available via amazon directly at the moment so no guaranteed flavor ratios the bag i got was strawberry smash tart sour apple googly grape tooberry blueberry wet faced watermelon mango tango pomegranate pucker very very cherry mango no tango was only one of the colors so a total of pretty close to as advertised i was surprisingly fond of flavors such as the strawberry and watermelon which i generally do not like in other candies artificially flavored ones however the blueberry and mango fell a bit flat in general though these are the best approximations to real fruit flavors i have come across in hard candy before hope the trick or treaters enjoy them as well 
positive,18/7/21,a great little candy tastes good really fruity and not too sugary my yo son loves them allergic to wheat and dairy 
positive,18/10/21,i purchased these as a nice treat for our children i try not to buy foods with artificial colors or flavors so when i saw these we tried them all the kids and adults like them i will certainly buy them again 
positive,15/6/21,my kids love these and like a lot of reviewers have said they do not have corn syrup or chemical artificial sweeteners in them it is still candy but treat wise it is a treat i do not mind my kids having in moderation 
positive,4/8/21,i just finished brewing a container of this tea to keep in the fridge i pre sweetened it with some simple syrup making it less sweet than most restaurants serve it as i do not care for super sweet tea i am not a connoisseur but this tastes very similar to the teas i have had in restaurants i do wish there was no artificial food coloring yellow 
positive,8/6/21,if you like the ceylon tea variety you will certainly enjoy and appreciate this tea in the years we have been drinking ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed the superb quality of ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years have always used loose tea but this time wanted to try their teabags because of the convenience portability and to see if the bagged tea would brew as clear as the loose tea and i am happy to report that it actually does i am so glad to find ahmad teas available here because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away the current prime deal for the pack of is superb much cheaper than i can find locally i am taking advantage of the subscribe and save offer the six tea boxes arrived nicely packed see the photos i uploaded each box has a packing date and a best before date this is a great tasting tea which i am happy to recommend 
positive,15/6/21,i have been eating boboli for years what can i say it is really the perfect pizza crust not too fluffy not too flat great taste great price i like this much better than the crust in a can varieties boboli s been around for years now for a very good reason they gave us a great product that has withstood the test of time and at a reasonable price to boot i usually brush mine with melted butter with a hint of garlic for added tastiness pile on the boboli sauce a ton of cheese and your favorite toppings and you have a home run for the whole family highest recommendations 
positive,4/8/21,my sister and i both loved the taste of this caramel taste and very sticky also both of us ordered more hardest problem is not eating the whole bag contents at one time 
positive,25/9/21,these are tasty but really sweet i did not notice they made my blood sugar stable any longer than any other bar i might buy them again if the price was right 
positive,19/10/21,tasty coffee works well in drip coffee maker smooth taste and nice flavor remember it is preground so do not expect fresh ground recently roasted bean taste but it is a lot more convenient 
positive,4/9/21,i just made myself a cup of this coffee and i think i found a new favorite brand when i opened the bag i noticed the pleasant vanilla aroma which was not too sweet and overpowering like other brands i used my french press to brew the coffee which i would not recommend the grounds are extra fine and the filter does not completely seperate the liquid from the grounds i mixed the finished cup of coffee with some milk and it tasted just like flavored vanilla coffee but without the syrup or sugar i really liked the taste it was mild but without any traces of bitterness definitely a good alternative to my usual starbucks coffee 
positive,31/8/21,easy to use and nice tast you can add ice cream it will be great taste 
positive,9/10/21,i have tried a number of senseo pods and this is my favorite it is very smooth it tastes like coffee from a coffee house rather than a senseo 
positive,15/6/21,with it is own typical strong taste like taster s choice also but this one surely tastes better with little quantity you can make it taste from mild to strong 
positive,4/8/21,this was a great product and easy to use i am now to fonadant decorating and it was tricky to learn how to get it on the cake but after the second attempt i got it and it was amazing and it did have a nice sweet taste and was easy enough for a beginner to use everyone loved the cake that i made 
positive,15/6/21,these are very tasty and you can find these udon noodles at most stores i really like the flavoring and this is my favorite flavor 
positive,4/8/21,i have been eating this stuff for years it was super simple to prepare as a college student and has a long shelf life now as a mother my year old son loves it and he is usually picky note that my son only eats the mild version of this sauce i mix it with steamed white rice or steamed quinoa both ways are fab but of course it is healthier with quinoa it is cheaper at the local asian market but if you do not have those nearby i guess this is the next best place to stock up 
positive,15/6/21,we really like this peanut butter the taste is great as my kids do not eat the completely natural peanut butter with only peanuts and salt i do not care for it much either this is a nice in between that i feel is pretty healthy we get this auto shipped by amazon for convenience and price we go through a lot of pbjs for kids school lunches and i eat quite a few of them too 
positive,4/8/21,i have very picky eaters in my house and this peanut butter is really great tasting and healthier too after learning about transfats and really fealing guilty giving my kids pb j sandwiches in their lunch with not so healthy peanut butter i decided to try this one and really love it thanks skippy you did it right 
positive,1/10/21,because my job involves talking all day and i am constantly surrounded by allergins i go through cough drops like mad the way i see it if you are going to consume something you might as well enjoy it ambrosoli honeeenergy plus more than fills the bill i found it to be very soothing but also had a strong honey flavor that i absolutely loved the very best review i can offer for this product i am about to order it again and will be back for more 
positive,1/7/18,i got them in a clear plastic bag but how do you think they look before they are packaged they were fresh and salty yummy
positive,10/8/18,i like these little cheese chips they satisfy my craving for something crunchy and who does not like that last little bit of crispy cheese from your toasted cheese sandwich that is what these are like just beware i did not notice right away that one bag held four servings not just one they are pretty rich so it would be hard to eat the whole bag but i could see munching on half of the bag which would be calories 
positive,1/7/18,i was skeptical of buying this soup at first but it by far surpassed my expectations it tastes soooo good 
positive,10/8/18,i had been drinking other mineral waters so far and i did not know how the taste of the mineral water is different from each other until i tried this water now i am really satisfied with the pure and good taste of this water and i will keep drinking the water i would like to recommend this strongly 
positive,13/9/18,when summer comes i am constantly drinking ice tea last summer i was told to stay away from caffeinated beverages what was i going to do without my ice tea i looked in amazon com and wow amazon had lipton tea bags and they were decaffeinated i was saved i ordered some and i have been enjoying my ice tea ever since 
positive,17/7/18,love this product do not like diet drinks but this one is very good without the after taste that aspartame leaves i add more water then the directions give and like it better this way 
positive,16/1/19,great tea wonderful mellow flavor you will not regret buying this tea fantastic buy 
positive,16/1/18,this is the best nuocmam ever smooth and extremely tasty perfect on seafood rice whatever highly recommended adds an amazing dimension to anything you use it on 
positive,16/1/19,this tea will be a staple in my cabinet i heard about it by word of mouth and the reviews were not exaggerating it is great i love the smell 
positive,1/8/20,while i do not like this as well as rose s lime marmalade and cannot help wondering why the lemon lime actually looks greener than the straight lime it still makes a tasty spread 
positive,1/7/18,great gluten free licorice treats but must be eaten fresh otherwise they get stale fast 
positive,10/8/18,i got a snow cone maker for christmas and was psyched i tried a cone with orange soda and was disgusted with the result but finally i tried these flavors they are amazing blue raspberry was by far the best with grape being the second best i recommend this to every one it is sooooooooo good 
positive,15/2/20,i have used this chocolate drink previously and i love the cocoa flavor that it has and it does suppress my appetite while providing a little boost of energy it does give you a huge jolt which is great because by the end of the day i am able to get a good night s sleep if hot chocolate is a thumbs up to you then you will love this drink plus its benefits 
positive,22/4/21,if you enjoy a bowl of ramen noodle soup but are looking for something healthier this is for you i just whipped up some of this with tofu and veggies yeterday just make sure not to overcook it because it will be less tasty 
positive,25/9/20,that is what i thought when i took the first bite i found these on an amazon manager s special for slightly less than box and the ingredients were healthy and intriguing with the seed combination and two of my favorites rosemary and garlic since there were no reviews i did not really know what to expect but i had to give these a try first of all they are very fresh crunchy the sell by date is months away they are cute little round crackers really tortilla chips as a tortilla chip these are the best i have ever had they are very sturdy you could use them to scoop anything including the thickest guacamole and i do not think they would break or crumble the delicious taste i got from the first one with all of the nuances of every flavor unfortunately diminishes where the rosemary and garlic is not really discernible but you still get that wonderful corn organic seeds flavor with just the right amount of salt way lower than most with i do not know if that is considered a low sodium product but many snacks and processed foods like most jerky and a lot of crackers are way too salty for me fyi nutrition info serving size about crackers servings box calories total fat saturated fat no trans fat cholesterol total carbs fiber sugars protein sodium by the way they are gluten free which is really important for a lot of people most of the crackers in the box i opened were intact with a few broken ones mostly at the bottom of the bag even though they are perfect on their own they would be really good with a black bean dip guacamole or hummus bottom line if you are looking for a tasty and healthy snack cracker chip these are for you 
positive,16/11/19,i orderd a case when the last grocery store i knew about quit carrying the product it is a very good olive spread makes a very tasty and reasonable calorie snack however two of the six jars had leaked and the lids were not sucked in i called the company and they credited my account immediately they get an a for customer service 
positive,9/9/20,gave only starts because recently amazon sent me a batch that was tough and hard to chew into but the product itself is great if shipped fresh the fresh ones last for a couple of months but if you get a hard batch recommend getting replacements because they are really hard to bite into and sometimes i feel like my teeth may fall out trying to rip into the hard pieces 
positive,1/7/18,iv been eating fruit leather for over years this is my favorite flavor buying in bulk is the way to go and they are very reasonable here 
positive,10/8/18,these are a tasty item and a great value i would say they are becoming a staple at our household i wish the raspberry flavor was a bit more pronounced but they are very fruity not artificial tasting nice short ingredient list too 
negative,15/1/20, kraft italian salad dressing fat free ounce packages pack of big mistake i am stuck with packets of these horrible tasting salad dressings kraft has a decent rep when it comes to items like this but they really missed the mark when they produced this item horrible very salty taste perhaps because it is lite dressing although i have tried other kraft lite salad dressings and they were not bad does anyone want to buy packets of italian dressing i will more then likely wind up throwing these out unless someone in my family decides to try them and likes them 
positive,1/9/20,these sugar free russell stover cinnamon bun snack bars did not last long here if i had not known they were sugar free i would never have guessed it the bars have a good cinnamon taste to them with some crunch and also are a bit chewy which i like they do taste like a cinnamon bun in bar form and are a good size for a snack the bottom is covered with chocolate and finishes off the bar so that it tastes more like a candy bar than a sugar free snack bar each bar has only calories russell stover makes several other kinds of snack bars and food items that are sugar free and i intend to sample a lot more of them highly recommend 
positive,22/7/21,we have tried several different brands of couscous this is our favorite it is a healthy choice that tastes great 
positive,1/7/18,i purchased this product because i like to have a little protein in me before my morning walk it is delicious 
positive,10/8/18,i do not like protein at all not protein bars not protein in my shakes i just do not like the taste these bars taste great i was hesistant to get them because i was afraid they would taste like the protein i hate but they are great i like these better than the cereal bars 
positive,14/5/21,so far the best decaf coffee i have tasted just leaves me wondering why no local grocery store carries it 
positive,17/10/19,this pasta is truly one of the best organic whole wheat pastas out there it does not taste as heavy or fibery as the other brands it comes as close to white pasta as you can get i second the other reviewer who warns not to overcook it as it easily falls apart 
negative,3/10/21,i bought this product because i knew i liked sumatran coffee i am new to roasting coffee but i roasted these beans many different degrees and cannot get much flavor out of them i sorry i bought and will probably throw away 
positive,15/9/20,if you like black tea this is excellent i bought it because i tried it at bigby coffee and loved it it is worth the price 
positive,30/8/20,the peanut butter cookie is excelent in taste just about the right amount of things added to give it the proper taste not too strong but just right 
positive,1/7/18,good flavor and a great carob i like that extra nutrients are saved from it being raw nice size bag as well 
positive,10/8/18,use it in casseroles stews soups and rubs for your meat use it everywhere except your coffee so glad i bought it it is fantastic 
positive,5/12/19,checked reviews about several companies this one had great ones purchased as a gift for my mother she is the expert on jordan almonds she said they were wonderful fresh and not over candied my sisters agreed they arrived right away well packed 
positive,21/10/19,these cookies really satisfy my hunger for chocolate they are not too sweet yet have an intense chocolate flavor without the high calories of a candy bar they are great 
positive,8/9/20,i have been taking this for many years and love it the taste is not bad at all though if you are used to having your protein drink sweetened with a lot of sugar or other sweetener you will be disappointed as this does not taste like a mcdonald s milk shake but the taste is fine it is hard to underestimate the nutritional value of this product as in addition to grams of vegan protein it is loaded with other healthful nutrients each scoop has a pound of dried fruit and a pound of dried vegetables in it plus a vitamin complex and enzymes if you are looking for a really excellent vegan protein this is the ticket plus it serves as a meal replacement and a multi vitamin 
positive,22/9/21,love this cereal great taste and does not get soggy this is my favorite of all the kashi cereals and subscribe and save makes it super convenient 
positive,2/10/20,my kids love these and i love giving them a treat that is not full of artificial junk i have also tried them and they are very good 
positive,25/7/20,i do not know how oats could vary considering they are just one ingredient but these are the best tastiest and perfect texture i thought i was crazy for thinking they tasted better than other easier to locate brands but then i read the other reviews and realized these oats really are the best 
positive,4/7/21,these are awesome and well packaged shipped promptly at a fair price could not be happier 
positive,11/9/21,this is my favorite of the or blends offered by emerald can only seem to find it at amazon since the local grocers seem to sell out of it right away or do not carry it will definitely be ordering this on a regular basis 
positive,4/7/21,this product is so fantastic the smoked salt is a perfect flavor for so many foods my entire family loves cooking with this salt and we have a bottle of it on the table for personal use too it is not too salty at all it just adds a touch of saltiness and a wonderful smokiness to any dish it is great on meats potatoes with cheddar cheese eggs it is a healthy alternative to bacon it is so versatile it is amazing this purchase is also a great deal you get jars for a great price we love it and plan to continue to purchase this product so we will never have to be without it again 
positive,21/9/21,i contacted the seller regarding the best type the raw or liquid type for baking and they recommended the raw type i was disappointed with the results since then i tried this in iced tea and again was disappointed i had to continually stir the contents of a large pitcher because the honey sunk to the bottom the taste of the honey never diminished but it was a pain in the neck to do the stirring every time i wanted a glass of iced tea next time i will buy the regular honey 
positive,11/9/21,i bought this for a gift for my father and he loved it the only down side is the price i will only get these as gifts and not as a food staple due to the cost 
positive,12/10/21,this tea taste better iced than it does warm i add stevia to it and it taste really good 
positive,11/10/21,great tasting peanut butter a little thick for spreading on bread but if you are careful you can smooth it without messing up the bread worth it though 
positive,28/9/21,the peanut butter was very fresh tasting the peanut chunks just as advertised were big the price was great the shipping was fast lot easier to order on line than go to the store 
positive,19/10/21,i seen these on shark tank and what drew me to them was they were made for a diabetic by a diabetic i decided to try a box and i can truly say they do taste good they do fulfill that sweet satisfaction you look for i am not a big fan on granola bars but i think i can get use to these they are also healthy cannot go wrong with that 
positive,4/7/21,these are a great snack they are filling and healthy for you my year old even loves them 
positive,11/9/21,i recently purchased this product and got a chance to try it out on some freshly popped popcorn i was surprised this was so tasty it has a mildly tangy white cheddar flavor that is not too overpowering this makes it easty to create a flavorful savory snack without the extra calories as compared to potato chips or cheese crackers for instance i hope to try the other flavors really soon 
positive,12/9/21,this is the only kind of seasoning i use for my soy tacos i stopped buying the del taco flavoring when i read that it contains message just to give you an idea of my tastes i loved the del taco seasonings so simply organic is a great alternative that tastes just as good without the side effects of message 
positive,13/7/21,great spice and i use it almost every day on all kinds of things it is a large container but given how much flavor it adds i think that it probably is a good thing that i bought this much 
positive,23/10/21,i bought this tea for a diet i was going to start and find it very good i drink it everyday now 
positive,22/9/21,i needed to fill a giant pepper mill i did not know if this package would be enough i had leftovers 
positive,4/7/21,i am not an expert on macaroni cheese from a box i love the real thing but it is time consuming i have tried kraft macaroni cheese but i was not impressed i read the good reviews for this annie s product i wanted to get the subscription to save money but packets was too many to buy when i did not even know if i would like it i went to walmarts and was lucky to get a packet they did not have many i just compared the prices in walmart it costs a box on amazon with the subscription a box costs that is a big saving i made it yesterday and mixed in a little grated mature cheddar after it was cooked then put it under the grill to melt the cheese i was going to eat half and heat the rest up today it was quite a lot for one person it tasted so good i ended eating all of it if you like mature cheddar you will probably like this it is great with ketchup on or slices of tomatoes added with the cheddar before grilling it it tastes almost as good as the reat thing i ordered it on subscription yesterday i cannot wait to try it again 
positive,11/9/21,i drink lots of tea and i must say that this is a pretty enjoyable variety the flavor is deep and hearty and creates a nice dark brew my parents thought that it was a bit too strong but i think that it is right on although one teabag can be used to make several perfectly good cups of tea if you are looking to try something new i would definitely recommend that you give this a shot it did not totally blow me away so i cannot give it stars some loose tea not in bags that i have tried has been more flavorful so that is why this gets a solid 
positive,8/8/21,cardboard box is a bit shoddy but the candies are perfect taste great just as i remember them flavors is kind of lacking but so what 
positive,9/7/21,easy to make great organic maple sugar and oats fantastic flavor even my teenage daughter loves this single serving oatmeal and enjoys it also as a snack after school 
positive,24/10/21,dr mcdougall s organic maple brown sugar light oatmeal is a fanatstic healthy way to start your day made from organic oats naturally sweetened this hot cereal is miles ahead of the national brands found in your neighborhood grocery store this oatmeal a delicious whole grain fiber rich way to make breakfast more nutritious in fact dr mcdougall s instant oatmeal is a great light snack anytime of the day given the great deal dr mcdougall s is on amazon com national bargain store brands of instant oatmeal simply cannot compete even in a tight economy very well worth a try highly recommended 
positive,4/7/21,we have purchased at least boxes of david pumpkin seeds and have not had a bad box in the lot will continue buying this great treat 
positive,11/9/21,we were disappointed when we could no longer obtain violet crumbles in the you s then we discovered the crunchie almost identical but better these bars arrived on time and is perfect condition none of the bars broken and no bloom nice light chocolate covered sea foam in perfect condition 
negative,24/10/21,looking to end caffein in my life tried several caffein free brands and this one was a big disappointment both my wife i will not finish the 
positive,22/6/21,i am not a huge tea drinker coffee every day but i do enjoy black tea earl grey chai tea and this tea is a nice addition i bought it because i would heard good things about it including dr oz recommending it at that point it was a question of which of the many oolongs on amazon do i buy i bought three they are all very similar in flavor require a touch of sweetener for my tastes but are very good they are all a bit subdued in flavor with this one being in the middle i have had no problems with the bags breaking or tea leaves or dust being everywhere 
positive,30/7/21,i have only used one other stevia product which was very good this is just as good and does not leave any bitter aftertaste in my opinion i only use it in my morning coffee two packets for a cup i would definitely buy this product if i wanted to stick with something organic however i personally still prefer splenda whether it is good for me or not 
positive,10/7/21,my favorite sweeteners are stevia and agave this organic stevia has a bit of taste of both the main ingredient is agave inulin and then the second one is stevia this makes it really sweet with no aftertaste in fact you can say that it almost has a hint of honey must be the agave inulin it dissolves quickly too a packet equals tsp of sugar i like tsp in my cup of coffe so i use only half a packet at a time it is very good though considering that it is organic and natural the price is slightly above what i would pay but i think it is ok if you are used to buying other products with stevia truvia costs about cents less than this organic stevia at about the same number of packets but truvia is not organic so it depends on what you are looking for 
positive,4/7/21,my spouse and i are both using this product and enjoy the slight taste of chocolate it gives the morning coffee 
positive,11/9/21,great product tastes great love being able to buy in bulk at a good price rivals generic prices well worth it 
positive,20/9/21,i took this stuff on a two week camping trip and had no problems with mess or attracting ants tastes great note that this does not seem to reconstitute into a thick viscus honey like substance my results were much more watery use in place of sugar 
positive,13/10/21,this is simply one of the best low calories food out there great taste low calories low sugar high fiber if you want to eat pasta and do not want to rack up the calories one answer fibergourmet 
positive,2/8/21,i love this cereal it is sweet without being cloyingly sweet you can eat a bowl and not feel like you have overdone your sugar ration for the rest of the day we love golden grahams with the plain soy milk unlike other cereals this tastes just the same with regular milk or with soy milk 
positive,11/6/21,huge fan of this crystal light flavor i usually find crystal light drink mixes to be rather concentrated so i mix one packet with oz of water and it comes out just right not too sweet the color of the mixed drink is also easy on the eyes it is a pale green color so nothing like the bright red blue purple orange colors that some of the other drink mix flavors will give you 
positive,2/8/21,keenan s pistachios are great i love having the no salt option the nuts are fresh with a very good flavor finding a clunker inedible nut in the bag is very rare 
positive,18/10/21,was pleasantly surprised they are very good and i do not miss the salt at all would always have to rinse off the salt but no longer 
positive,23/7/21,i like the packaging individually wrapped and the taste of the coffee cannot find a thing wrong with it 
positive,8/7/21,i received a free sample in with an order i would placed on line and thought why not try it only calories and no artificial sweeteners flavors or preservatives oh my i am hooked the grape flavor is not weak like kool aid it is just right not too tart not too sweet this product also has electrolytes in it so it will help keep my hydrated when i work out 
positive,11/6/21,well what kind of review can i write for snack bites i was quite surprised by their taste which is very good i wish they were available in bigger packages otherwise the packaging itself costs more than the bites that is the reason for stars i mean the cellophane costs as much as the meat 
positive,25/6/21,grew up with them as a kid in california then disappeared for years found them while in the midwest for business and then on amazon i am very happy to have a breakfast favorite back 
positive,2/8/21,i was a little bit uneasy at ordering a plant online but bonsaiboy sent this beautiful cherry tree promptly and it arrived in beautiful condition i will definitely recommend him again 
positive,11/6/21,very nice blackberry tea without caffeine the lack of caffeine allows a cup in the evening without interfering with sleep good taste up to the usual lipton quality
positive,9/7/21,i am already a fan buyer of lipton s herbal tea having tried the island mango peach the mandarin orange and blueberry pomegranate i like the fact that the ingredients are natural hibiscus flowers rosehips blackberry blueberry raspberry it is definitely herbal tea there are no actual tea leaves in the ingredients which is why it is caffeine free i also like that lipton uses the least amount of material needed to make the tea bags and they are not wrapped individually the teas that do so annoy me as wrapped bags are a time waster and a resources waster there is no need to wrap each one i especially like the taste of the tea it has a very nice flavor note i use bags at a time to make a full pitcher of iced tea 
positive,22/6/21,i bought this on the recommendation of ruth watson the hotel inspector and i use it in everything frozen vegetables soup meats etc 
negative,2/8/21,the flakes are like eating twigs and straw i contacted company and they said would send coupons to replace my product but i never got any thing in the mail ever
positive,11/6/21,i purchased this item because of my wheat allergy but it tastes even better than the semolina elbows that i was using it cooks up in minutes and even my husband who has no food allergies loves it 
positive,8/7/21,for a time we could not get low carb pasta in our local store so i ordered this it tastes great 
positive,28/9/21,these healthy flakes taste very good even though they are low in sugar and high in fiber and nutritional value they do lose their crispiness in a bowl of milk but i either eat fast or snack on the flakes right out of the box these make a great healthy substitute for other wheat flake cereals on the market 
positive,23/8/21,this has become our first choice for coffee we have a bed and breakfast and the guest always comment on how good the coffee is great taste with a fantastic price 
positive,1/8/21,all of these fruit snacks are large and tasty muscat was a little gross but all in all a great product 
positive,16/7/21,these are just too tasty seriously they need to come in a big box like fiddlefaddle i could munch on these all day long i do not get to as my wife and kids keep cleaning out my supplies before i can get to them damn you job 
positive,2/8/21,a tasty snack but a little too sweet do not leave them in a warm car they get horribly sticky not for someone with braces either 
positive,11/6/21,i usually stick to calorie pack snacks but at only calories i thought i would give these a try they are very tasty not too sweet but enough to satisfy my ever present sweet tooth the size of the package is just right for a mid day snack 
positive,26/6/21,just the right mix of chocolate caramel and crunchy popcorn very tasty plus the box is separated into calorie packages so you do not sit down and eat the whole box at once 
positive,20/8/21,for the price you cannot beet it it is not to sweet but enough to have some flavor and it really does taste like root beere 
positive,25/8/21,this is a great calorie snack with great taste and texture amazon delivered a fresh product with an expiration date a year out to the guy who said there are only cookies in a bag that is crazy it is more like cookies per bag maybe more i did not count them but i was not disappointed by it at all 
positive,19/10/21,i really liked this a change up from strictly white tea very expensive though so will only order every once in awhile as a treat 
positive,2/8/21,izze is probably the best carbonated beverage that money can buy even better than jones soda all of izze s flavors are all natural and taste fantastic i especially love sparkling blackberry it is worth paying more for the quality especially since they have fewer calories than soda and better ingredients very tasty and highly recommended 
positive,11/6/21,my son that i bought it for did not like it but i sure did used it in coffee and cocoa unique flavor best to blend a batch before using as it takes some effort to get to dissolve completely without clumping but even the clumps are great tasting 
positive,22/10/21,great tasting found the right combo for taste better than eating all that sugar you will not be disappointed with this syrup 
positive,6/8/21,eat think smile cinnamon almond granola clusters is a tasty snack that i enjoyed quite a bit it is not exactly health food but i do not think there would be an issue in enjoying this treat in moderation eat think smile cinnamon almond granola clusters are made up of large granola clusters too big to be eaten easily as a breakfast cereal but just the right size for snacking the most obvious ingredients are oats almond bits cocoa and cinnamon neither the cocoa or cinnamon taste is overpowering at all and i found that the combination of these two tastes was much better than i would have expected now as i mentioned above i would not consider this product health food despite the claims on the package about the antioxidant power of the cocoa and cinnamon after all a small serving contains grams of fat and grams of sugar and among the ingredients listed are brown sugar palm oil and evaporated sugar cane juice but as a substitute for more highly processed sweets this will do ok overall i am a fan of eat think smile cinnamon almond granola clusters and would likely buy it in the future 
positive,24/6/21,gluten free pasta can be less than acceptable this brand of pasta tastes just like regular pasta even my husband who is not gluten free loves the taste i have tried all the styles of their brown rice pasta excellent 
positive,17/4/21,these are delicious and though they have a lot of sugar they also have a lot of vitamin c if you have trouble getting the kids to eat oranges strawberries or anything with vitamin c these can help these sell for a good price too especially with the food discount going on 
positive,10/3/21,i have tried many versions of stevia and this one seems to taste the best 
negative,17/4/21,the muffiins had absolutely no taste i added some extra sweetener and some ginger and cinnamon and they tasted much better 
positive,21/1/21,i am a newbie when it comes to homemade waffles i purchased a belgian waffle maker through amazon and was looking for a good recipe for the waffles when reading the reviews of the waffle maker so many mentioned this waffle mix that i figured i would give it a try instead of making my own i am so glad i did i used the tip of adding milk instead of water and followed the rest of the directions exactly from start to finish this morning i was enjoying fresh waffles in minutes the taste was restaurant quality and it was easier than i imagined 
positive,30/1/21,i wanted something to fill the new flask i just bought so i scoured the whiskey aisle and this product caught my eye boy am i glad it did after one bottle shared with friends over the weekend i am ready for more my new favorite i do admit with others that it is a bit sweet but hey what did you expect from maple syrup try it you will not be disappointed 
positive,13/2/21,this was an unusual treat that i normally would not think about getting however i got it and was very surprised at how food it actually was surprises await you when you try new things 
positive,15/1/21,these crackers are a great treat for those who are gluten intolerant as well as those who may be looking for a potato chip substitute these rice crackers have good flavor good crunch and just enough salt 
positive,6/3/21,i bought some of this tea at jungle jims and absolutely love the frangrance as it is steeping and the taste is wonderful i even make it into iced tea 
positive,8/6/21,this is very tasty it is a great item to have around for company pull out some crackers put some cream cheese or even havarti or edam work well and then top it off with this yummy jam it is hard to find where i live

positive,17/4/21,this was a tasty snack that i enjoyed might be a little to hard for those with teeth problems but otherwise okay oats walnuts and cranberry with a little chocolate is a good combination 
positive,10/3/21,purchase from the commissary perfect snack size the combination of the crackers and tuna make very balance protein to carb ratio and total calories are under my calorie per meal eat small meals every hours taste is spicey and yummy without a sauce i tried a different brand and it had a sauce in the tuna yuck not this i also used this to make tuna cakes and did not have to add any seasoning they were such a hit i had to go buy a case from the commissary to share with the ladies group hoping amazon will get it so that i can order it as an automatic subscription even my hubbie that is not a seafood person loves it 
positive,14/1/21,easy to prepare the filling is very tasty i made a salad with one box everyone loved it 
positive,24/5/21,order came promptly we love this easy way to make a flavor addition to a number of our foods will likely try other products from this line the food bloggers were right very yummy

positive,17/4/21,fast delivery i like the fact i am getting trace minerals and iodine better than normal table salt also bought the bulk package too 
positive,10/3/21,this is a tasty seasoning mix the instructions call for deep frying the chicken but it tastes just as good if you pan fry with minimal oil it is not that spicy so add some pepper sauce if you like it really hot you can probably create this seasoning pretty easily by yourself for less money but the pre mixed packet is nice for lazy people who do not have lots of different ingredients lying around in their kitchen 
positive,10/7/21,this is a must have spices are just right a little on the spicy side but not too hot for people that does not eat hot spicy foods captures the taste of new orleans i add smoked sausage slices and it everyone loves it 
positive,27/1/21,i lived in europe when i was and would purchase these from street side kiosks these are good however i age them to greatness by leaving the cover off for about a week this gives the belts just the right amount of staleness and brings back the nostalgia of youth 
positive,1/6/21,received my order today i was very pleased with the fast shipping a dried is a lot i ordered which will last me a longgggggggg time 
positive,20/8/21,it tastes really good but is the price wrong each you can get the for a dollar each on sale at vons

positive,21/4/21,i wish these came in larger quantities if i could have a cuppa everyday i would so refreshing and tasty 
positive,1/4/21,this drink is so delicious i would had the chocolate chai before so thought i would try the vanilla chai though the vanilla taste is not as strong as the chocolate taste it is still so yummy great price on amazon too 
positive,17/4/21,my daughter and i love the taste of big train vanilla chai it is not too spicy like other chai s can be 
positive,10/3/21,i liked it well enough not my all time favorite as i prefer my trio bars nuts fruits for breakfast however if you are a chocolate fan but feel guilty about eating candy this is the product for you 
positive,22/4/21,great milk my year old loves it we used to drink the kirkland brand but cannot get that where we live now 
positive,25/4/21,one of the few soy milks my slightly milk allergic kids will drink consistently easy to carry and just the right amount per box price on amazon is quite a bit cheaper than the pice in our local stores 
negative,1/4/21,the other ones are really good just cherries for example just cranberries taste like nothing and are impossible to chew on no sweetness no tartness no bitterness taste like eating cotton
positive,30/6/21,generally shy away from flavored milk or like milk products but this nestle product tastes really good the kids and grandkids all like it too not slimey and no funny after taste much better for the kiddos than sodapop 
positive,1/3/21,for those that need decaf but still like the strong and bold taste this is the one my go to cup of decaf 
negative,29/1/21,i have purchased gf oats from bob s red mill and from legacy valley i store all my grains in the freezer so they should not become rancid once they are in my possession but the oats from legacy valley taste rancid they have a very bitter after taste none of my kids will eat them and unfortunately i bought a whole case i do not recommend this product buy bob s red mill instead 
positive,17/4/21,the tanka bars i purchased were moist solid tasty without too much salt or sweetener and a small amount alleviated hunger for several hours at a time as i diabetic type ii i often have hunger pangs throughout the day pieces from one bar provided my body with enough energy to make it dinner time without the need for a sugar lift this helped me maintain a steady blood glucose level all day a little bit goes a long way so it should not be gobbled like an energy bar the taste will tempt you to do so it is pricey but certainly worth it i keep several in my go bag 
positive,10/3/21,not sure about how these are priced as i bought them originally at the dollar tree for but it was a package of only oz not the oz available here on amazon the cookies were such a surprise especially coming from the store they were so good i wanted to eat the whole box they are super tasty with coffee like biscotti but more melt in your mouth not too sweet not too bland just right loved them 
positive,30/5/21,i ordered jyoti natural foods looking for something healthy and quick while providing a lot of protein this tastes really good i was shockingly surprised and relieved my money was well spent i have had indian food at very authentic places have a lot of indian friends and i would say this is very close to going out to eat highly recommend 
positive,28/9/21,my husband enjoys this for lunch with warm pita bread it is quick easy and tasty he can just heat it up at work in the microwave 
positive,6/5/21,tasty great breakfast blend not too terribly strong would recommend well worth the price will order more soon buy it 
positive,20/4/21,this is a great tasting cup of coffee even though a little strong for some my only complaint is the price i drink several cups of coffee a day and this is cost prohibitive for me 
positive,20/4/21,my dog is crazy over this food usually very finicky but loves it is product 
positive,21/4/21,i just received these as a birthday gift from my sister the strawberries were perfectly fresh juicy and sweet they were dipped perfectly and completely coated in delicious chocolate i was so impressed she ordered them yesterday and i received them today they came nicely wrapped with birthday ribbon and packaged with a freezer or cold pak again i would highly recommend these as a delicious treat they are expensive but well worth the special treat for someone 
positive,2/5/21,i find these to be addictively tasty i like the oz tins because if i eat a whole tin it is not really that bad compared to oz 
positive,18/12/19,i use this as a treat for training and my dog just begs for more lessons i slice into small bites then add a little warm water and soak for mins easy and my dog will not choke when she inhales the food during lessons 
positive,19/1/20,this product is a great organic version of tuna helper my family loves it and it tastes great 
positive,19/1/20,i bought my first jar of kraft s vegemite the australian brand and i must say the flavor is strong salty and slightly bitter every morning i have a bit of vegemite on my buttered toast i have quickly become very fond of this new morning ritual it is an excellent source of folic acid and b vitamins i recommend that you experience the flavor sensation for yourself 
positive,31/3/20,like all other diet powdered chocolate it does not dissolve well even in the hottest water you have to smash some of it against the side of the cup to get it to dissolve i use it in my coffee mmmmmmmmm yum
positive,18/12/19,i absolutely love this drink but everyone else i know cannot understand why i do they all say it taste like medicine but to me its delicious liquid crack i suggest trying one before buying a because it is an acquired taste i love it and have been drinking this for years 
positive,13/10/19,this tea is very robust and tasty especially after a long tiring day at work i sooths your nerves after a long day and works wonders on a cold winter evening while reading or just chilling 
positive,28/9/20,this is the second time i have purchased this item no sugar added taste like regular chocolate not like sugar free which is awful good night time drink before bed
positive,16/11/20,the hot chocolate has a great taste i purchased it because my sister was worried about the kids having too much sugar every night before bed the kids had no idea it was sugar free even the adults we gave it to had no clue like other reviewers said it does not mix very well so we actually made it on the stove in a pot so it would have time to mix up if you were looking to make one packet with just some hot water stir it a lot and even then you will have some chocolate not melted on a positive note each packet does make a decent size cup of hot chocolate enjoy 
positive,27/2/20,this is probably the best tasting zero calorie flavored water i have ever had becareful though this does have sugar alcohol in it and if you have too much it can because bowel discomfort 
positive,26/2/21,if you like strong coffee you this with the medium r small size setting i prefer mine on the maximum water setting and it is quite tasty and very consistant from box to box i have tasted better only in coffee specialty cafe s timothy s world coffee midnight magic extra bold k cups for keurig brewers count boxes pack of 
positive,18/12/19,this is about as good a cup of coffee as you can get single serving is great and although it may cost more per pound it saves money in the long run because you do not throw any away always hot and always fresh with scheduled deliveries i never run out i strongly recommend it 
positive,19/1/20,this is the best coffee if you like a strong cup a real wake me up
positive,13/9/20,so many flavorings like this sound and look great but taste funky this tastes great i have only tried the black cherry and it does give you a little boost as well not a caffiene heart thumper 
positive,10/7/20,it taste good but bags seems too much for me so share with your friends also suggest other flavor of indomie noddles
positive,14/4/21,these taste so much better than the ones i bought at the grocery store which turned out to be plain white sugar sprayed with carmel coloring these are pure demerara sugar with a taste similar to brown sugar 
positive,24/4/21,this brand of pasta is easy to cook and taste great my children cannot tell the difference between it and wheat pasta 
positive,28/4/21,i like this product because it has a lot of protein and whey protein since i am allergic to soy which is in almost everything else it tastes good promises no junk included and seems to work well for me 
positive,12/7/21,ordered these after receiving my new k cup machine taste great after finding the correct serving size quick service and good price definitely ordering more 
positive,18/12/19,we lived in hawaii for a few years have been searching for kona or maui coffe we live in secluded area so have been ordering on line not too much acid great tasting 
positive,19/1/20,it is not a complete replacement for sugar but it tastes great and substitutes for sugar more often than not 
positive,28/4/21,i was introduced to kilambe coffee by a friend and immediately i tasted quality it is now part of my special collection along with my vietnamese coffee used only on weekends special occasions or having guests over if you enjoy a dark bold taste with the slightest scent chocolate and a fruity feel from mother nature at high altitude kilambe is for you 
positive,8/8/20,bought this for my wife we would recently bought a celestial seasons variety pack and had been stunned by the over a dollar a cup price tag this was a much better buy and is now my wife s favorite k cup tea regardless of price i just wish amazon would offer it as a subscription so we can shave off that fifteen percent 
positive,22/5/21,i am pleased with this salad dressing the olive oil flavor comes through nicely i have used this salad dressing on regular garden type salads and it tastes like home made dressing i have also used in pasta salad and it adds a zesty taste using this olive oil based dressing is a good marinade for meats chicken or even veggies especially if grilling there is a good balance between the herbs and olive oil to make this salad dressing taste good in different types of food if you like vinegrette you will find many uses for this product i highly recommend it 
positive,18/12/19,though it made my water taste better it did not make me zippy i did feel as though i was getting nutrients and enjoyed the flavor it did not take much to give it taste either
positive,19/1/20,i add this to my cold brew lipton ice tea that i prepare took a bit of experimenting to get the right amount of juice concentrate but once perfected it is like drinking the perfect blend of sweetened ice tea the taste is great and no calories cannot beat that only demerits is that the price is rather high could use a few dollars off on the bulk purchases 
positive,3/8/20,this liquid vitamin is pretty tasty i thought it made my water taste like watered down crystal light my kids also liked that it made their water turn pink and gave it a faint sweet taste it is not overwhelming in sweetness or vitamin in taste i could not detect the vitamins at all the only downside is that it requires refrigeration after opening 
positive,29/7/21,this drink tastes as good or better than similar drinks that we have had that are made of powder the directions do not tell you how much to squeeze into your water so i would imagine it depends on how big of a glass or bottle you have and how strong you want it to taste you can always add more the only concern i have about it is there is caffeine in it and i really do not want to have any extra caffeine after my coffee in the morning you might want to beware of that if you are buying this for children 
positive,8/7/20,tried the fruit punch in a glass of water a little goes a long way and tastes great turn bottled water or tap water into a great tasting beverage refreshing no cal and healthy
positive,13/4/21,i am always looking for a good energy drink that will give me a boost but not a big let down i like the glaceau energy water this is a good alternative this makes ounce servings at a bottle it is only cents a glass vs or so for the vitamin water by glaceau or others found in the supermarkets and convenience stores the flavor is like a light fruit punch you can control how much you want to add to your water for taste it has a combination of vitamins b and vitamin c zinc magnesium and chromium it has about the same amount of caffeine as a can of soda so not too much no jittery feeling after drinking it it is good to get healthy vitamins while i am drinking water and not just sugar and caffeine from sodas 
positive,20/2/21,i do not drink energy drinks on a regular basis but i do enjoy them while outside exercising energy drinks usually have sugars and caffeine in order to claim to be energy drinks and this stuff also has taurine in it one can also taste the sucralose it also contains vitamin c and electrolytes the taste is a citrusy punch delight and the fact that this comes out of a squeeze bottle that is measured to yield servings means it is easier to allow for more or less liquid according to taste i prefer my drinks on the weak side because i drink more of it and strong red drinks tend to leave a red moustache on my upper lip the red dye in this mixture can stain countertops so be careful when pouring this liquid easily comes out of the bottle and returned to the frig afterwards for the occassional drinker who would need a month to finish off the contents this is not a bad tasting mixture i have not felt a zing after drinking this though 
positive,9/12/20,this is not nearly as concentrated as the mio water flavors that you also squirt into your glass or bottle of water but you get a lot more of it oz and one fluid oz squirt has daily requirement for vitamin c and no calories the fruit punch tastes good however i like my water to be very weakly flavored so i probably put in about a squirt giving me of my daily requirement for vitamin c it is mainly advertised as being a source of vitamin c but there are more things beside vitamin c in it vitamin c vitamin vitamin vitamin vitamin zinc chromium the plastic bottle is a good shape for your hand to grab it easily and squeeze this might be a good way to get some needed vitamin c without having to eat a lot of citrus or swallowing vitamin c pills and if you like your water flavored but are particular like me about how much flavor is in it then this is a good way to control it 
positive,1/4/21,i love this drink squeeze a bit into water lemonade or club soda this tastes great i found it to have a fruit taste a little sweet and the best part you do not have to use a lot i found it out to be better then the mio fits in my bag no more pricey drinks at stores no more a few drops and i have a refreshing drink everyone in my family really enjoyed it as well 
positive,25/2/21,i really love this stuff and i will be buying more for sure one bottle lasts a really long time too it is better than any of the diet fruit punches i have tried so far i really cannot recommend this enough stars 
positive,18/12/19,having worked in a movie theater in high school and through college popcorn is a very nice treat that was years ago and it is still a very nice treat the seasoning salt makes this treat even more enjoyable by adding the right flavor to the popcorn to bring back memories of going to a movie in a less stressful time 
positive,19/1/20,everyone likes this it is very salty so you only need to use a tiny bit i add about half a teaspoon to the popcorn before popping and it is very tasty this carton should last for a long time 
positive,14/10/20,my cats love this food and particularly the duck flavor this is a high quality cat food however depending on your cat he she may prefer another brand flavor what can be said is that this is a really healthy food for your cat 
positive,10/3/21,i usually use hellmann and bought this and will be purchasing it again my family and i really like it 
positive,15/8/21,i really like the taste just a touch of salt but they are more chewy then i would like the gustaf s rounds are a little better 
positive,27/4/21,very tasty but as a word of caution do not over eat these bears when the label warns you it may have a laxative affect believe it otherwise enjoy 
positive,24/1/21,a good product overall it is just a base so anything you add will step up the flavor tastes good with any meat a little butter and plain yogurt mixed in makes it smooth a creamy the tiger tiger and patak s ready made sauces are good too 
positive,14/7/20,biryani when done as per instructed comes out really good and authentic i do not like their other products but highly recommend this for any indian food lover total preparation time is around hour but its really worth it
positive,5/6/21,we tried all different saimins noodles the dashi soup is most delicious did not know koreans made saimins too they are better then japanese saimins noodles cannot wait till i receive them 
positive,9/7/21,i saw these as i was checking out of a beer store honestly and thought i would give them a try they are all organic and taste great they are also all shaped somewhat differently roundish which gives them a unique homemade look the color is a bit off white as well with some dark chunks small but not specks in them which adds to the unique appearance these are not made with artificial sweeteners yet the calorie carb content is very low the mint flavor is interesting because i found it got more intense as kept on sucking not less so as others do great product and much cheaper here than where i bought mine cool 
positive,5/6/21,i received this item as part of a gift during the christmas holidays i enjoyed it so much i got on the internet and searched until i found it although it may not be everyone is cup of tea it will become a regular part of the holidays at my house 
negative,25/7/21,these are much lower quality than the usual poppy seeds i purchase as some of the other reviewers described they have almost a dirty taste to them and not much normal poppy seed flavor they are not good for baking i am wondering if they are used for something else like poppy tea which would explain their high ratings by others i ended up throwing out both bags pros cheap price non irradiated fast delivery cons poor taste not baking eating quality unusable for eating cooking so cheap price does not really matter 
positive,13/7/21,i enjoy this tea plain with honey or with a splash of milk the ingredients are simple and natural no soy lecithin no so called natural flavorings very difficult to find herbal tea in the market place that does not have junk added to cheap it out my children enjoy this tea warm with honey during the winter iced during the summer with a hint of sugar and a wedge of lemon ingredients hibiscus cinnamon ginger peppermint orange peel rose hips rose petals
positive,9/7/21,my two basenjis had a few guests over last week end and came the time to share a few bully sticks the atmosphere was electric everybody was sitting nicely some of them were holding their paw in the air as if to say me first me first the noses were twitching the tongues were meticulously run over them turning every piece of olfactive information into tasty dribble anxious eyes opened socket expanding wide the wait was unbearable after a few seconds of this gleeful spectacle i handed the treats out everybody grabbed theirs there were a few side glances a couple were dropped but immediately retrieved nerves you see and after one or two growls the chewing began it sounded like a mini munching factory the stench was heavenly and when every little fiber had been devoured we all cheered for valuebull tree times 
positive,8/7/21,i have to respectfully disagree with some of the other reviewers although i did not find this the best version of earl grey out there it was very tasty and i enjoyed it for a system that can provide me with tea at a moments notice i am quite pleased you cannot expect something that provides you convenience like the tassimo to produce the same results as hand brewing from a tea bag or leaves 
positive,15/7/21,according to my labs this tastes great it also lasts a long time against two chewers that get through most anything very quickly 
positive,6/7/21,i am currently in afghanistan and we received this mix in a care package the smell filled our entire building we almost had to lock our door to keep people out the entire loaf was gone in about minutes absolutely delicious we added the oz of water and then added another ounce because the dough looked a little dry again this was one of the best breads we have made here yet and will be ordering some very soon 
positive,13/8/21,they were very tasty bought them for my son he is interested in anything japanese they last a while in your mouth but not too chewy almost like gum you can swallow they have a great flavor not to sweet or tart i highly recommend them the price was good as well for pack i believe 
positive,5/6/21,i fell in love with this tasty snack when i grew up in england i guess it is fortunate that when i have opened a bag to indulge these addictive snacks no one wants anything to do with them it truly is an acquired taste but once you have it you cannot stop i love them with a cool cocktail in the evenings especially a whiskey sour i buy them now by the case and cannot wait to get home tonight to indulge 
positive,9/7/21,the fruit cake is very tasty and pricy as all the good ones are glad i found it 
positive,17/6/21,this coffee is very strong tasting we cut it in half with regular coffee and it still tastes wonderful it makes the house smell like maple syrup as it is brewing but the taste is not too much love it 
positive,31/8/21,took a while to arrive and the box was kind of dingy but it was well worth the wait nice kick for coffee sugar free ice cream and as flavored sweetener 
positive,7/8/21,i love this coffee i have been drinking eight of the clock for years until i tried cameron s southern pecan which is much better it has a definite nutty flavor the pecan flavor itself more subtle but definitely detectable a little chocolaty flavor adds to it to make a rich but not bitter taste if brewed right i find that level tablespoons to oz of water is about right but i make mine slightly stronger anything less than tablespoons to oz and it will taste like average store bought it is just got a wonderful warm flavor i just make enough for cups in the morning grinding enough beans for days so it does not lose flavor great stuff 
negative,6/9/21,i wish i could give this product a negative number for my review this is the worst thing i have ever purchased here on amazon in the last yrs of using this wonderful site please do not buy this product it literally taste like dirt i cannot believe anyone who has tried this product has liked it noticed i have not called this product by it is name cinnamon reason because it is not it is dirt save your money and go pick up mccormicks cinnamon what i had to do if the people that make this dirt read this review please contact me and let me know how i can get a refund and return this dirt to you you guys should be ashamed of yourselves for selling this dirt and passing it off as cinnamon 
positive,5/6/21,this soda bread mix makes for good food it is very expensive though but for the right occasion or a treat i will buy again 
positive,9/7/21,i bought these berries as i needed to add something to my cart for super saver shipping i was planning to get goji berries from whole foods in bulk the cheapest source by me for organic gojis in town they run about a pound there i got them on sale here for i liked the ones from whole foods but these are even better they are fresher probably since they are put reasonably quickly into the bags and sealed the other ones taste like some sort of gummy fruit rolll up type treat good but these actually taste like a fruit you should buy some the only problem is that i eat them too quickly they should be called wolf them down berry 
positive,19/6/21,oil is very pleasant to the palate fruity with a distint olive taste which is what i was looking for excellent product far superior to any italian evo i have tried 
positive,5/9/21,tastes every bit as delicious as regular heinz ketchup what was disappointing however is that i purchased bottles and the expiration date on each bottle was only months from the date of purchase this was very disappointing as i had expected an expiration date of at least one year or more 
positive,10/10/21,chervil the one spice i did not realize was so darn hard to get after searching up and down this infernal state in hopes of finding it somewhere in person i outstretched my arms to the infamous internet more specifically amazon i typed in the letters and wallah i found items i decided to try this as i have limited experience with chervil i will admit it and i am happy to report that it was safely in my hands exactly when i wanted it i opened it up to sample the herb and from what i could tell it was also exactly as described i would recommend this herb for at least a taste of something different and considering the speed at which i got the item i am extremely happy so till i experiment again live long and eat well 
positive,29/9/21,product was great shipped when it should have price was right i would recomend this product to others we use the raw coconut butter in our oatmeal and toast 
positive,11/9/21,quick and easy to prepare this is one of the few whole wheat pastas i have found that has a great taste i use orzo in place of rice in recipes as well as in soups etc 
positive,5/6/21,each of the gummies are in indiviually wrapped bags like one they fit perfectly in my favor bags for my wedding would for sure get these again in the future really adorable 
positive,9/7/21,i goit my package a day late which is not that bad buuuuut eh at least it got here i had a bliss almost immediately after opening the box at first the fizziness and awesome was amazing and the taste was grand but the fizziness left really quickly i did not feel blissfull but instead i fell asleep for about two hours the sonic i just opened and have taken two sips amazing flavour amazing stuff i am already feeling a bit of energy d i lovelovelove that the top slides off and can act as a cup its helping me make sure i drink it slowly and enjoy it as much as possible great product overall the four star is only because of the day late package i am sure its because i ordered on a friday and so there was confusion about weekend timings and such eh 
positive,26/8/21,just received my shipment best by date is june of and it is mid march even though it is only me i am pretty sure i will use most of it by the time june rolls around tasted just like the starbucks pods i have purchased locally before the stores stopped carrying them definitely no complaints 
positive,26/7/21,as far as english tea s go it is at the top of my list very beautiful dark red color and incredibly flavourful i drink about cups of this tea a day though sometimes i will mix the day up with a cup of barry s gold blend also a fantastic tea though i feel yorkshire gold is better by just a hair 
positive,11/9/21,it really rastes great no real aftertaste either like some other energy drinks color is fun as well and makes for a great mixer i will order again 
positive,11/9/21,the product description is very accurate i received my item in a timely manner and the items were well packaged and still frozen the portions are large and are very easy to prepare in the oven and of course the chicken cordon bleu has a wonderful savory taste that is not skimpy on either the ham or cheese if i could rate stars i would simply due to price however do not let price stop you from ordering these are delicious 
positive,15/9/21,i bought this in an effort to reduce my sodium intake and replace ketchup on everything i eat i have put in on eggs cauliflower cabbage and some meat dishes tastes great very happy with this and will try some other flavors 
positive,5/6/21,this was my first time eating pad thai favored anything these were the very thin noodles if i remember correctly it is a unique taste compared to most ramen i mean fried noodles i have purchased in the last month definitely worth a try if you are planning on tasting some different asian dishes 
negative,9/7/21,i used to be allergic to peanuts as a child and i have a strong taste aversion to peanuts and peanut butter but i love almond butter after hearing rave reviews for barney butter i decided to try out their version i do not know how they do it but somehow barney butter tastes exactly like peanut butter i know that this is a plus for some but if you like peanut butter why would not you just buy peanut butter why make perfectly good almonds taste like peanuts if i buy almond butter i want it to taste like almonds 
positive,14/9/21,these granola bars are quite delicious out of the three bars that kashi makes these are my second favorite next to the trail mix ones these make a good snack 
positive,29/9/21,nice for break fast no bloated tummy applely flavor enjoyed several breakfastes with the pan cakes good taste and texture yummy for kids too 
positive,10/7/21,these are by far and away the best chocolate chip granola bars they are nice and chewy without being too dry or wearing out your jaw like other organic granola bars we are never without these as a special treat for us or our kids however they are way cheaper at walmart around a box and there are generally coupons that can be printed online which brings the price inline with a sale price on quaker bars which do not even come close in taste to the cascadian farms bars not to mention the high frutose corn syrups and hydrogenated oils in quaker bars even with subscribe and save these are a box boo for the price 
positive,1/3/20,i do not know if i believe this tea is helpful for losing weight but it tastes great and its a wonderful alternative to soda which is the reason i bought it 
positive,28/7/20,i was a bit cautious when i first opened the box i need gluten free and sugar free products with low carbs this candy fit the bill the texture is a bit strange but wow the candy is tasty and lasts a long time i bought the ginger licorice and raspberry flavor 
positive,28/7/20,my favorite coffee it is very dark and has a wonderful flavor without the bitterness reminds me of the coffees served in germany 
positive,10/11/19,this is great tasting coffee i have been buying melitta coffee for over twenty years and it is the only brand of coffee i will buy it is great that i can order it through amazon 
positive,1/3/20,baby loves this and so do i it is very tasty and great for breakfast or lunch one of our favorite banana combos but the beet comes through and of course the blueberry just adds a little something extra highly recommend 
positive,3/8/19,these are delicious it is been hard to find a good stewed tomato the kind my mom used to can this is very close a real fresh tomato taste and seasoned perfectly other brands have a tinny taste to them and usually are too sweet 
positive,6/2/21,i cannot say enough about this philadelphia suburb local company bala cynwyd i hope one day skinny water will be linked with philly like soft prezels and cheese steaks of course the best cheese steaks are in the suburbs of philly this product got me off soda 
negative,24/2/21,tried this and the chicken neither left a pleasant taste at all they were bitter and just not good for a soup base 
positive,13/5/21,i have tried all the commercial brands of hemp milk the second best to tempt is hemp bliss by manitoba harvest which is more green tasting tempt unsweetened original is delicious enough to drink straight with no grassy notes after a few mornings of breakfast with tempt i feel like i am almost eating cereal with milk by itself it is refreshing what is greatest of all is that there are no pesticides or herbicides and no gmos and hemp is grown on sustainable farms the ingredients are free of gums preservatives chemicals and flavor enhancers and this one has no sweeteners the only real downside is like almost every commercial producer they insist on adding traces of cheap vitamins to produce an unbleak nutritional analysis i take exception to the addition of vitamin a palmitate in particular as having no health benefits whatsoever 
positive,1/3/20,beats other brands by a mile love the taste kind of earthy milky smooth has a straw like aftertaste that does not linger high in omega too but wonder why amazon dealers sell over retail is mind blowing especially on a case you would expect a big discount my local health food store has it for two eighty two a box 
positive,28/7/20,very tasty item although i enjoy it more with some veggies but overall great sauce and quality product 
positive,13/5/20,i am not a tea snob and this tea taste great came fresh and packaged well and at a much better price then the local tea shop and health food stores 
positive,26/3/21,if you are a fan of sweet or honey mustard try this out french s has a good line of various mustard flavors and this does not disappoint you get the tangy spiciness of mustard with an edge of honey so for those of you who like a touch of sweetness in your condiments this should not disappoint you 
positive,29/8/19,five pounds of beans is a lot of coffee the dark brazilian beans seem to sit somewhere between a columbian and french roast the flavor is very nice and makes a nice cup of dark brew 
positive,7/2/21,i have been drinking this coffee every morning for about a year now and really like it the pound bag lasts a while so it is an excellent value it smells wonderful when you first open it i am so glad to not be spending a fortune on grocery store coffees anymore 
positive,14/10/21,i hate popcorn but i loved this popcorn it is crunchy and sweet but not over poweringly so the seller delivered the product extremely fast and way before planned i would surely buy this product again and from this seller again

positive,14/9/21,if you like rice cereal and need gluten free all the erewhon brown rice cereals are really tasty 
positive,17/12/20,i like good coffee and have tried quite a few different coffee beans i have been very satisfied with the flavor of cameron s organic french roast whole bean coffee plus it is organic which is just a wonderful extra i certainly intend to keep buying this coffee if the flavor continues to be so good 
positive,2/5/20,we have tried many different whole bean french roast coffees this is one of the better we have tasted the fact that it is fair trade organic and shade grown is a bonus
positive,14/7/21,this was quite yummy i tried it and also is nice and thick to help older babies learn to eat food with more texture my son preferred this to apple sauce which is about half as thick as this 
positive,18/7/19,peanuts were shipped very quickly and i received them days after placing the order they taste great and are exactly as described 
positive,1/3/20,i put these in one of those antique looking gum ball machines you can buy for your home the yummy hot cinnamon flavor has the perfect amount of heat and sweet 
positive,28/7/20,this is my very favorite tea it has a nice strong blackberry taste a must try for berry lovers like me 
positive,13/6/20,nice flavor not overly ginger hot quick ship for a lower price than i have seen from others i will order again
positive,10/3/20,i forgot all about these fine treats i think i will add them to my order there are so many sugar free treats that do not seem sugar free and this is one of them shaka sez check them out
positive,9/5/20,this is the best tasting soup i recommend this soup to anyone who has a head cold after eating a bowl of this soup with mixed vegetables cut cooked chicken breast my head cold was gone the next day 
positive,14/5/19,i cannot have chocolate but can consume white chocolate i was looking for something to add to my milk so i could have a change once in awhile this product is very good tasting but does not mix to well in cold milk i still use it though and enjoy the flavor 
positive,19/10/20,these things are great they never freeze solid they are always slushly and each one is only calories 
positive,1/3/20,gopicnic is a wonderful option for my college aged daughter she never really stops to eat and when she does finally give into hunger it is usually not good food she loves the convenience of the packaging and the freshness of gopicnic i appreciate the nutrition in each package the new salmon and crackers is one of her favorites 
positive,28/7/20,without going into any of the actual health benefits i am just commenting on how tasty these bars are very chocolaty and delicious i will definitely purchase these again 
positive,7/3/20,i love these everyone with whom i have shared them agrees they are so satisfying i eat at least a bag a day i love the other crunchy cheese products but these are my favorite 
positive,4/8/20,i had tasty bite punjab eggplant that i picked up from target under bucks inexpensive and yummy very similar to kashk bademjan i had at a local restaurant great with some pita bread chips or raw carrots etc 
positive,26/12/19,i keep a few of these in my desk at work for days when i do not feel like going out to lunch they are super convenient because you can microwave them as is just tear open slightly to vent and put in the microwave no bowl required just a spoon or in a pinch tilt your head back and slurp it the taste is great i love indian food and i love vegetables so this is perfect for me the only thing to mention is that one of my co workers complained about the smell but he is that sorta complainy person who does not eat indian food and prefers burger king it tastes great smells great and is super convenient 
positive,28/3/21,i tried this today and it was delicious it is not the texture you at first expect from eggplant the flavors bridge that and are really great next time i will put this over rice 
positive,6/2/20,i do not like plain coffee but even more i do not need or like all the calories and fat that come with using flavored coffee creamers even the sugar free creamers have a ton of fat part of which is hydrogenated partially hydrogenated flavor blends for coffee are a wonderful alternative to fatty creamers easy to use and they come in portable small packages you can take with you anywhere this is not a creamer but more a flavored sugar one packet gives a yummy subtle hazelnut flavor but without being too sweet the way some things with splenda are 
positive,25/4/21,with no extra salt it tastes a lot like fresh corn you can add the salt after if that is to your taste everybody s will be different 
positive,3/8/20,this is fantastic corn you do not need to add a thing to it it is perfect right out of the can of course a couple of the cans were dented to be expected with shipping i am just sure to use those quickly great price with subscribe and save 
positive,15/4/19,i love these they have a lot of flavor and no corn syrup great product 
positive,9/3/18,i got this item as a little gift to my little sister who loves japan she my brother mother and i tried it and it tasted great 
positive,18/5/18,for some reason i can never find grape flavor in the stores so this was a treat my bro in law says i eat like a year old so what when it is this tasty 
positive,9/3/18,roasted to city city and it is excellent brewed in a french press very aromatic while brewing smooth flavor some fruity tones i will have to try some of the other green coffees from these folks but will definitely purchase these again 
positive,27/2/18,i love oatmeal cookies and have made them at least hundred times i love my cookies but these come in a very close second to my under baked soft homemade vanishing oatmeal cookies there is some ingredients in these cookies that i do not find in my kitchen cabinet but if you are not against prepackaged food it should not bother you i loved the allspice taste but my guy friend did not that much i think he is just partial to my cookies the individual serving size is nice i am more apt to just have one cookie this way rather than opening a whole box and having to eat them before they get stale i could say that individually wrapping the cookie saves me from just having one more and one more and they are delicious and make me feel like i am eating something that is somewhat healthy for me after all there is oatmeal in the cookie 
positive,20/2/18,love these cookies my son asks me to heat one for him in the microwave for about sec its soooo good that way gives it the freshly baked feel i always make sure to keep in stock in my home they are also individually packed do makes it easy to carry along in my bag
positive,22/3/18,when i opened the packaging i was surprise to find one of the best tasting cookie i have had in a while not only did it taste great the texture was perfect and it was fresh 
positive,12/3/18,received these in my influenster box for summer taste great and very soft seemed to be a healthy alternative to regular cookies just concerned as to how much they will cost 
positive,9/2/18,these cookies are very tasty and soft i received a complementary cookie in my mom vox box and will definitely be buying more 
positive,7/12/17,i got this cookie as a part of my mom box from voxbox i am not too keen on oatmeal cookies but this one was surprisingly good i guess i am more used to them being hard so i really liked the soft chewiness of my cookie now a chocolate chip one would be fab 
positive,24/5/19,these cookies are quaker baked mom and kid approved they are soft chewy and most of all delicious the texture and taste makes them seem homemade without the hassle of baking 
positive,9/3/18,these cookies taste fantastic even my picky children love them and ask for them every time we go to the grocery store 
positive,18/5/18,these are some of the best oatmeal raisin cookies ever i usually bake my own cookies but to be honest i am not sure i can do better than these they are soft melt in your mouth and bursting with flavor 
positive,23/3/18,these were really good i got them free to try and loved them very filling and tasty me and my husband shared it and we could not wait to buy more 
positive,8/9/20,these are very good nice and soft would for sure get again since they are packaged individually its nice for travel a great snack 
positive,23/2/18,the soft baked oatmeal cookies may be the best oatmeal cookies you can eat that are not homemade they are well baked to the point had they spent another minute or two in the oven they may be burnt which is exactly how i like my cookies and even though they are soft they are firm enough they do not crumble in your hand and there is enough raisins you will have at least one or more in every bite on the flip side the ingredient list is a bit lengthy with a few ingredients that i cannot pronounce is a red flag for me 
positive,18/7/20,these quaker cookies are so great they are easy to carry around and they make a great snack when you are on the run 
positive,14/6/18,loved my quaker cookie it taste really good and is very soft unlike them other hard cookies i could eat a whole box of these yes they taste that good
positive,2/11/18,these cookies are soft and delicious possibly because they rely more on oat flour than just rolled oats they lack the chewy texture of a traditional oatmeal cookie instead they are almost melt in your mouth with nicely soft raisins as well perhaps the only truly detrimental characteristic is that they taste more like a raisin and spice cookie than an oatmeal cookie i enjoy the taste of oatmeal and would not mind if it was brought more to the forefront i do not usually buy individually wrapped food so i do not think i would buy this product again but i would certainly recommend it to others 
positive,14/10/18,the first were great the second was spoiled but amazon contacted the supplier and shipped another batch so far they are ok 
positive,6/4/20,jelly belly s have always been my secret vice now that i live out of the country i got this mammoth jar and it will last me more than a year it came fresh and well sealed and right on time love the variety of flavors yum 
positive,9/3/18,these were really tasty some might even say habit forming the only thing is that they are a little expensive my family loved them so i will likely purchase them again 
negative,18/5/18,taste was average and i would not buy it again since taste is personal others may like it better 
positive,7/3/18,this was a gift for my mom for mother s day she seemed to like it a lot of them all seemed to taste the same 
positive,24/1/19,my wife found this coffee in a local grocery store and it is great tasting coffee however the local grocery quit carrying it and we were able to find it at amazon we started ordering and it has so far been a good experience 
positive,27/2/19,the popcorn salt was an added tasty treat to homemade popcorn thanks for the prompt shipment 
positive,19/4/20,i really like lentils so i gave this a go good balance of veggies and lentils a bit too salty though overall a great product i would definitely buy again 
positive,17/4/20,i eat this cereal almost every morning it has a great taste and texture i have been gluten free for months now and this is my favorite cereal i know that this is marketed for kids but as i am yrs old i can truly say that adults live this cereal too 
positive,3/4/20,once we tried this fabulous spice mix for beef fajitas we were hooked we use this spice mix everytime we prepare fajitas on both chicken and beef it is not too spicy so if you like real heat you might want to add some cayenne pepper it is just right for us and allows the beefy flavor of the skirt steak to come through it also does chicken proud we serve them on fresh flour tortillas 
positive,7/8/19,i like the fact that this capuccino is not that sweet the taste is really good i give it four stars because i like the amaretto one even more 
positive,9/3/18,great taste and goes with all types of mexican food have used for years and all of a sudden this product extremely hard to find at grocery stores and walmart so was pleased i could order and shipment was here quickly 
positive,18/5/18,this steak rub is awesome we have tried many different ones and came across this one in a grocery store it quickly became our favorite after that we could not find it in any local stores so having the pack is great 
positive,27/1/19,these are excellent i was worried they would taste too natural and not really like a cookie kind of like the difference between kashi cereal and normal cereal but they taste like any high quality choc chip cookie and have the added benifit of being a little bit more healthy easier to justify than a pack of oreo s all in all a excellent product that arrived in perfect condition and i have a active once a month subscription for them for the last months 
positive,10/11/19,this is the only store bought cookie i will eat when it is kashi i know its healthy love the wholesome goodness of oats with the chocolate chips this is a staple in my house treat yourself 
positive,8/11/19,i had heard that champagne vinegar was good from tv chefs and cooking magazines i realize now just what i was missing i highly recommend it you will not be disappointed a little goes a long way 
positive,25/10/21,to be fair i have not tried this in my drip coffee maker only the bialetti moka express cup stovetop percolator the flavor is strong but smooth it is not as bitter acidic as starbucks and i like starbucks alot definitely recommend for the bialetti p s the tins are nice too great for re use around the house 
positive,8/5/20,nothing and i mean absolutely nothing compares to these semi hard chocolate she will outside and incredibly smooth chocolate inside it is heaven in a box godiva does not even compare the absolute best chocolate ever 
positive,28/9/18,cheese is great just what we were looking for considering it is hard to find this product 
positive,29/7/19,my boys have severe allergies this is something that they enjoy and are able to eat i love these because they are easy to pack on the go 
positive,9/3/18,this honey tastes great plus the fact that it is raw and research indicates it may be useful in the healing of stomach ulcers is a bonus 
positive,18/5/18,if you are looking for a tasty snack look no further these caramel fiber one bars taste like a cross between a candy bar and a granola bar the consistency is chewy but not so chewy that it gets stuck in your teeth since each bar provides of daily recommended fiber it is relatively healthy as well for those individuals that are on weight watchers these bars are points each and well worth it i highly recommend this snack i also recommend the peanut butter fiber one bars although they are not quite as tasty in my opinion fiber one bars oats and peanut butter count boxes pack of 
positive,17/5/20,this apple butter has a great taste but the price is so i would not purchase again i know it can not cost this much to produce such a small jar
positive,26/3/20,these are very pricey so i only enjoy them now and then as a treat but the flavor is wonderfull and the packaging is very nice would make a wonderfull gift to send to someone who likes such dainties i will order again when i run out truly a nice treat 
positive,24/2/20,i have bought several of the vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality the product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better my labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than most 
negative,3/5/19,i do not know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere but they were so old that they would not cook i had to throw half of them out because the skins were damaged a clear sign of dried beans past their prime i cannot even return these or ask for a refund because food is not returnable will find a different brand to use for now i have about fifty servings of beans to throw away 
positive,27/3/20,the recommendation when we bought our puppies lhasa bichon mix and lhasa poodle mix was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned this is a somewhat expensive food so i cannot say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home let me just say this i have had small dogs before never have i seen such gas issues both of them consistently had foul gas consistently usually when they are sitting on our laps but you know they are dogs when we got through the first bag of this stuff we purchased more on amazon it was a great price for it since we got a lb bag for the price of i think a lb bag at petco but they continued to have gas i mean they loved the food do not get me wrong and they loved it more when we would mix in some water and it would be like soft food somehow that made their gas worse but i think i will have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down cannot blame the food itself for gluttony eventually we switched their food no more farting i think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies they just need that in their diet i think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful they said up until year yeah right you try dealing with gas for that long around mos of age we switched to puppychow much better granted they do not like it as much but we humans like it a whole lot better 
positive,31/12/20,although there were several shriveled ones they taste just fine i mostly use them to make vegan sauces and other recipes that call for running them through a food processor so they do not have to look perfect anyways for the price they are a great deal about half of what i find them for in the store 
positive,13/1/20,just got this order and it is ok a bit light on the cheddar flavoring and herb taste eludes me if it is there 
positive,21/9/20,better than organic oats advertised elsewhere takes lots of water these are not minute oats so my oatmeal cookies come out right not all crumbly and soggy instant oats have their place but not in cookies 
positive,2/12/20,i have used maybe half a dozen bags of this tea in the last year and it is a delicious consistently good quality black tea mainly i use it and several other numi teas in my tea blends for making kombucha 
positive,20/11/19,the product is of high quality and has a rich full flavor delivery was unexpectedly fast the only negative i would like to see addressed is that the product is packed in a heavy paper sack while this may be commonplace a significant improvement would be to have an inner liner of a heavy weight food grade plastic bag that can be sealed after each time you open the bag could be either a zip lock bag or a twist tie closure does not make any difference just need a practical way to preserve the freshness of the product and keep the bugs out of it this is a health and spoilage issue s of oatmeal is a lot of product and needs to either be repackaged by the consumer in small food grade bags or containers very expensive and hard to find i am a single senior who likes to buy staple goods in bulk to save money and provide food security long term storage is a big issue with people like me thom missouri 
negative,2/12/20,i was extremely disappionted when i opened my shipment of enjoy life on the go bars very berry carmel apple and cocoa loco the boxes are now a plain generic design you know the kind all brands change to when they want to make their products look cheaper i then compared the ingredients of the new shipment with the older boxes i still had at home guess what cheaper ingredients next i taste tested and let my year old help he would not eat the new ones and i cannot blame him they are oily and bland i thought enjoy life was a brand that actually cared about using quality ingredients to make a good tasting product i was wrong in summary these are way too expensive to be made with low quality unpalatable ingredients 
positive,11/12/19,i previously tried other matcha products and was generally satisfied with the quality but not the price i decided to give pure matcha green and rooibos a try because the price seemed to be very competitive the quality of pure matcha s products surpasses that of all others i have tried stays fresh has a consistent texture and tastes great both the quality and price are better than others that i have purchased for the same quantity i highly recommend pure matcha and will continue to purchase 
negative,20/11/19,this product described as organic raw cacao powder from peru is clearly inferior to all other raw cacao powder i have had the taste of this product is definitely not as good this product has a bitter muddy thin taste as compared to the fuller richer taste of the real thing from other vendors as soon as i tasted this product which is destined for the trash bag i understood why it was cheaper than organic cacao from other vendors it is nowhere near as good spend a few dollars more and get the real thing 
positive,28/6/20,all of the roland products are top quality roland s caviar is the real deal unlike some other brands that are really made from seaweed 
positive,8/8/20,my doggie really likes newman s organic better than some other dog foods pet and big box stores sell my budget does not like newman s organic as much as harmony farms it is the compromise that keeps the doggie and my budget happy because he eats it heartily i do not worry that he is getting enough high quality food otherwise he will not eat his food and he will graze in the trash seeking egg shells and bones to fill the void there is no barfing digestion problems or accidents high quality food means good digestion a shiny coat high energy bright eyes and a good attitude without tons of additional elixers treats or vet bills a definite cost effective win win for doggie and me i have had great results with newman s dog food that i orderd through amazon but there is pounds less for about the same price psst i am not an organic fanatic it is the nutritional value that counts for my fur baby and human kids update noticed this has jumped to almost thirty bucks will opt for newman s organic when the costs per pound are the same my dog likes both harmony and newman my budget likes the one most cost effective at the time of purchase update last batch of harmony farms i ordered had a rancid oil smell when i opened the bag and the pooch would not eat it as readily as he has in the past he would not eat for a day and started checking out the trash i subsequently purchased some canned and pouch foods cooked brown rice etc as mix ins to encourage him to make it through this pricey bag not sure how this is stored before it arrives to my home but the texas heat can make anything stale rancid yucky quickly i probably should have called customer service but felt the replacement would have the same issue due to the hot weather here definitely exploring hot weather alternatives 
positive,14/7/21,no more heavy grocery bags for me i have just ordered my first bag of harmony farms dog food and it was delivered to my door by ups the food is excellent quality i bought this product based on its healthy ingredients the dogs love it and i love amazon for making it so easy to buy july one of my dogs has had bouts of inflammatory bowel disease previously she had to have special food from my vet royal canaan duck potato for the past years she has tolerated even thrived on the harmony farms food w o any problems each bag of harmony farms is about cheaper than the royal canaan hard to fight i am a believer the canned food is great too september my dog who has had inflammatory bowel disease in the past verified by surgery has never felt better she is a wire and has the energy of a yr old dog she is she is not on any daily medication this healthy weight formula has helped her to thrive enough protein not too much fat seem to do the trick i highly recommend it 
positive,2/12/20,i love this tea it has a very smooth taste and not bitter like other kind of tea i do agree that the string seems to come apart easily but i can live with that no big deal the quality of tea makes up for that 
positive,20/11/19,i got two bags from my friend who got it from his friend who said it was primo so i chucked them in a zip lock when i got home mos later i opened it and had some today i am online trying to find more 
positive,1/3/21,had this sent to me in afghanistan the flavor was enjoyable but not to spicy it is made with quailty ingridents i would surely say this is one of the best salsa s i have ever had 
positive,5/5/21,these are excellent quality flaxseeds i just toasted them a little on a pan and even that made a great snack i also powdered them in a coffee grinder after toasting them a little and the powder is delicious too delicious nutritious awesome planning to have it in my cereal tomorrow and maybe sprinkle some on my veggies i think i will also try out bob s quinoa and museli 
positive,2/12/20,lots of uses for this green tea i generally like most tea though not the over ally flowery blends being on more of a health kick in recent years i have added a lot more green tea to my diet in one form or another from straight brewed tea lt hot or iced to adding the powder to things like salad dressings smoothies baked goods etc i am not new to green tea as i first started drinking it when living in japan some years ago in the ground form known as matcha a quality product dissolves well i like both the unsweetened and the lightly sweetened 
positive,20/11/19,i like to put wild rice in many dishes this is a good buy and easy to drop into other rice dishes or soups 
positive,9/10/21,my month old daughter has loved these ever since she started chewing her food they are tasty healthy and have zero additives on the downside every few handfuls there is a pea that is as hard as a freaking rock i can barely crunch into it with my adult teeth so i worry about what would happen if she really bites down on them with her baby teeth that being said it is been months and nothing bad has happened and it has not worried me enough to stop feeding her the peas it is just something that i feel should be noted to those considering purchasing this otherwise excellent product 
positive,6/3/21,i thot i was satisfied with the spring water i have bought elsewhere until i bought this brand best i have ever tasted no chemical aftertaste i have cases a month delivered since i also use it for all cooking needs and ice cubes too it is soooooo delicious when making a glass of lemonade from fresh lemons with the aforementioned cubes with agave sweetener mercy as others have stated the ups man does all the hard work and i do not have to worry about running out of the most important staple in my household 
negative,12/2/21,this product taste stale and is full of artificial ingredients no real peppermint is in this product and to be honest it does not even taste like real cocoa is either 
positive,2/12/20,i do not understand why this dog food is not full of reviews checkout they give this dog food out of stars which beats science diet and purina one which i use to use and diamond natural is less expensive 
positive,20/11/19,i do not review much but i have been buying this brand for my irish wolfhound for over years now he still loves it and it is good for him if you have a large breed dog this dog food will be a good choice for healthy food 
positive,25/6/21,this food gets an a rating compared to failing scores for many others in the price range however it is about more here on amazon than at the local pet store after a sales tax 
negative,17/3/20,i have been purchasing this product for about months the taste of the product is inconsistent from lot number to lot number i have gotten cases where the chips had no flavor at all have contacted the manufacturer times have not received a response from my latest inquiry i do not recommend purchasing 
negative,20/10/21,i ordered this item on march i expect to get its replacement from the people at blue sometime today so what is a month anyway the first one that came from amazon had a constant high pitched tone i emailed then called blue and eventually spoke to a pleasant tech support guy who was aware of the problem he allowed that the company had shipped out a number of units with this defect that is always good to hear so several emails later i received a return merchandise authorization and shipped it right back to them who knows if this one works maybe i will like it blue s products look good but they make a strong case for buying locally 
positive,21/7/20,melitta s rich flavourful product is a delicious treat comparable to coffees with a much higher price tag it is a plus that the decaffeinated version does not sacrifice flavour highly recommended 
positive,22/2/21,i am a big coffee drinker much against my better judgement but due to a stomach condition i have been forced to drink mostly decaf for the last few years i usually just get the cheapest coffee i can find near my office after all i do not make a lot of money and every penny counts so it was nice to get this melitta cafe ground coffee to sample when i made my first cup i was immediately attacted by the pleasant aroma i put in a little cream and splendas as i usually do and found the taste a little on the light side yet quite bitter maybe it is because this is decaf but what i did like was its pureness something cent coffees usually lack i have made two cups a day since my first taste and over the last couple of days i have grown to like this coffee granted to me coffee is pretty much like wine in that all the different varieties taste more or less the same except for the level of bitterness but even i can tell this is gourmet coffee much better than the ones i get at my local coffee stands or even at mcdonald s when they give out free cups for a pack of the price seems decent if you drink decaf i think this is quite worth a try 
positive,8/6/21,i love this tea both the green and white varieties are quite consistently fresh i have ordered this at least ten times from various internet sites i did not realize how old and stale tea from the grocery store was until i had this brand for organic tea it is quite reasonably priced they recommend using two tsp of loose tea per cup i use half that and it tastes great never ever bitter very smooth tasting i highly recommend 
positive,2/12/20,i feel good about the quality and mix it with canned pn food she does not care for it by itself but then she does not like any dry dogfood 
negative,20/11/19,we have been using newman s organic dry dog food for over years it was a godsend when we discovered it our little jack had such severe allergies she was tormented day and night with unrelieved itching after trying endless other avenues to find relief for her we were to the point we thought we might have to have her put down for her to find relief then the idea came up that maybe she had chemical sensitivities so we decided to go organic all her deals miraculously cleared up once we started the newman s however after giving glowing reviews for many years we now have to concede something has changed our little jack s itching returned to the point of drawing blood it is clear something changed and i believe it clearly is no longer as organic as it once was we are on the hunt again i am not saying it does not have good quality ingredients but if you have a dog that is highly chemical sensitive this likely is not for you too bad it once was a superior product 
positive,25/1/21,dogs love the taste and i love the company especially convenient to have it delivered rather than me lugging it home 
positive,1/7/21,we were looking for an organic food after the melamine poisoning of pet food debacle newman s own dry foods for cats and dogs are manufactured in the us per their corporate veterinarian newman s own is up front about their ingredients for an organic food it is affordable also it has been great at keeping skin issues under control lastly newman s own is listed as a more responsible pet food company on several websites 
negative,30/9/20,i received these in bad condition most of them were broken but the ones that were not had holes in them they were so weak that they would tear when you tried to roll them i would try three ladies brand they are a way higher quality 
positive,15/3/20,these are beautiful smooth spring roll wrappers and on the package label there is a sticker on each one that reads new technology so i am figuring by the bad reviews that this company changed the way they manufacture their spring roll wrappers and have probably upped their quality control as well i was nervous about ordering these by the bad reviews but i am glad i took a chance because these are a bargain compared to some of the other brands will definitely order these again 
positive,6/7/21,i use a lot of various spices in my cooking and wanted to find a source with a quality product at a reasonable price frontier met that discription 
positive,29/6/21,i have been feeding wellness grain free for a couple years now with great results for my cats i believe the cost of a top quality food is well worth it in healthy happy cats and reduced vet bills but still the cost of wellness has been prohibitive i was excited to see felidae had a grain free formula in the larger sized cans and for a much lower price so i am trying it just switched them over this week so far so good the bowls have been licked clean and while i questioned the whole peas when i saw them they were not left in the bowl the ingredients and quality of the felidae seems comparable to the wellness so unless i find information indicating otherwise and i have been looking i think we will stick with felidae 
positive,29/6/21,happy with this purchase it is a good deal it is the most fragrant coriander ever coriander is a super spice tri dosha and a health supplement as well research it it is a ground cilantro seed we use it in lots of dishes thank you 
positive,26/7/21,i have tried a number of high quality canned cat foods to supplement the dry food my cats always have available to them and these appear to be the best as judged by me and the cats for one thing these actually look like fish you open the can and there are large pieces of actual fish in the can instead of the weird mystery paste it pretty much smells like you have opened a can of real fish too not in a bad way though i do not share my cats love of sardines one of my two cats is a picky eater when it comes to canned food i picked up a can of each of the varieties from the local pet store when i wanted to try switching to tiki cat and learned that the picky one will only eat the varieties that include sardines there are a few different sardine varieties so at least it forces her to have some variety in her diet in case they stop producing one of them the picky one has always been very excited about getting her daily quota of canned food but the other cat seems way more excited about dinner time since we switched to tiki cat so i take that as her endorsement of this positive review 
positive,21/10/21,i wanted to give homemade vanilla extract as gifts and was extremely satisfied with these beans they made very high quality extract and were much cheaper than at local grocery or organic food stores i was mildly concerned by the size i only needed beans and ended up with closer to however my brother has used the remainder to make delicious vanilla ice cream creme brulee tiramisu custard vanilla sugar french toast etc i have recommended them to friends and family 
positive,25/10/21,we have been using walnut oil for many years we brush it on toast to take the place of butter eliminating much of the saturated fat from our diets it is also wonderful in salads try it tossed into greens with a few nuts and chopped stone fruit or grapes and a fruity vinegar this product is of excellent quality and amazon has a great price for it 
positive,29/6/21,it is hard to tell most of the time if supplements work but i just have a greater sense of well being when i take this product it really is a good source for essential fatty acids i expect to keep taking it 
positive,5/7/21,i purchased this product for my goats initially i like to give a warm drink of molasses water to my does after they kid and i also give a tablespoon full to any goat that seems to be feeling poorly it seems to give them a good boost when they most need it i bought an extra bottle for the house because i have always loved a bit of molasses on my biscuits much of the molasses even that labeled blackstrap that i have been finding in recent years is bland and seems to lack flavor this molasses is quite delicious if you like molasses and is rich and flavorful it also has high iron content higher than i was finding in other brands 
positive,17/9/21,flour type is better than regular flour whether frying it or baking it dough maintains softness and pliability i like it a lot 
positive,18/8/21,taste amazing the honey flavor goes well with the smoked barbeque taste it is soft but not too soft it also has a nice tang and spice to it but nothing too extreme smell as soon as i opened it everyone in my section ran up to see what the smell was i would describe it as alluring and inviting not overpowering or off putting price for a pound of this quality of jerky i would expect it would cost more needless to say you get more bang for your buck in short if you want a good jerky to snack on you cannot go wrong with this selection do your tastebuds a favor and get this jerky 
positive,31/7/21,we are white popcorn enthusiasts and were very pleased with this product large tender kernels of poped corn used an electric self stirring poper worth the cost 
positive,18/10/21,nuttzo makes great nut butters their chocolate version is like nutella should be less sugar and other crap delicious and super nutritious 
positive,29/6/21,our family really enjoys this shells and cheese i love the convenience of mac and cheese but usually the flavor is horrible annie s tastes great and is better for you cannot beat that 
positive,16/9/21,my son asked for this plant for his birthday and he is very happy with it it seems to be doing well thus far hopefully it will continue to thrive it was packed well in the box and incurred no damage during shipping 
positive,24/8/21,a brother in a sicilian family who owns an italian food market deli here in san diego tipped me off to this product over a year ago the difference it made in salads and vegetables sauces and meats was unbelievable there is a pleasingly clean peppery bite that makes it distinctive adding a bold delicious flavor to fresh salads cooked vegetables and roasted chicken and meats i have tried many other brands of extra virgin pure select or other types of olive oils growing up in an italian household and in my years none of them stimulated the taste buds with the savory satisfaction delivered by academia barilla extra virgin olive oil the product is not widely known but the laboratories at academia barilla in italy have developed as good a commercial product as is currently on the market and in my opinion it is the very best the cost is high but consistent with the higher end oils but if you enjoy fine foods and preparing aromatic dishes simply put this oil turns them into a gift use it and enjoy the satisfying reaction and comments of dinner guests as they realize they are being treated to a very special dinning experience quality makes a difference 
positive,24/6/21,i especially like like this on lydia s organics kale krunchies mega green oz g i empty the kale into a container sprinkle on habanero powder put a lid on it and then turn it over and over to mix the two wow i have heard it is great with popcorn too whatever you do just be careful how much powder you use i have been in a world of spicey hurt more than once 
negative,27/9/21,overpriced beans they are packed in a glass tube that is not air tight the beans were thin and almost dry get the cheaper options at amazon instead they are much better and way cheaper 
positive,29/6/21,my cats love the food and it is on the happy list of companies that do not test on animals linked through the peta site peta org that is very reassuring 
positive,5/8/21,i feed prowl because it is a high quality healthy food that does not break my budget it is much cheaper than other premium wet foods wellness weruva etc and my cat seems to like it the only downside to prowl is that since it is dehydrated you must mix it with water and wait minutes before serving my kitten meows at me the entire time i started my cat on prowl because my vet offered a free sample she ate it right away with no problems however she would only ever had healthy food so i was not transitioning from an unhealthy grain filled but addictively tasty food it is very easy to digest and may be a solution for cats with digestion problems i recommend like another reviewer that you order a free sample and give it a try 
positive,29/6/21,nice alternative if you cannot find them locally great gift for the avid cook 
positive,31/7/21,chia seeds are a great healthy food to add to your diet i make chia gel by mixing them with water c per tablespoon of seeds then stir the gel into yogurt oatmeal smoothies it is flavorless and the seeds have a pleasant crunch this brand is high quality and i would not hesitate to recommend it 
negative,11/9/21,i bought nutiva organic chia seeds before two pouches ounces each with tax this brand in one ounce pouch the quality and the taste are the same but the latter one is way much more expensive buy nutiva organic chia seeds not navitas in terms of the taste i usually toast mine and add them everywhere cereal yogurt oatmeal etc tastes great and full of fiber 
positive,12/8/21,this is a good product and very high quality the majority of people who post on amazon and the internet are not medical providers and are not the least bit inclined in the area of sciences or infant nutrition there is a large amount of misinformation out there and the misinformation is evident and propagated throughout the reviews for this formula as for this product specifically similac organic it is the top echelon of quality with regard to consistency and nutritional value we have had great success with this product and are very pleased overall as an adjunct to breastmilk abbott labs product maker is a very large research reagent laboratory for the medical sciences and they have very rigorous quality controls in place published research and they also provide reagents to the scientific research community exacting standards that said i would be less inclined to trust some of the other small makers of formula ie other organic products suggested as better in these reviews especially the referenced small name organic powders all said and done the components in all of the similac products are the highest quality and monitored with advanced scientific protocols and are well researched in published studies i would trust this brand similac over the smaller no names plain and simple keep in mind it is what best suits your baby and with nascent developing gi tracts all babies will experience some degree of gas and discomfort regardless of the formula or nutritional source even breastmilk it is sad to see people in these reviews propagating misinformation as they are neither pediatricians physicians do your own research and best to avoid those with ulterior motives as well as the misinformative reviews and internet blogs that are overly slanted or biased 
positive,31/7/20,thought i would take a chance on this as my grocery store does not know about maple syrup grades light amber is best price is beautiful grocery store charged as much for two ounce bottles as this whole quart shipping time was amazing super saver in days and yum reminded me that it is been years since i bought a pound box of maple sugar candy time to search again lt grin forgor to mention definitely grade a fancy not grade b the cooking grade hidden springs maple vermont maple syrup quart fancy grade light amber 
positive,13/6/20,my wife became spoiled when we were on a fall trip with the taste of light maple syrup it is not available in the south so she was very happy to find it from amazon com hidden springs is very high quality and have fast shipping thank you 
positive,31/7/20,i eat a mix of this along with the asin nature s path organic heritage flakes cereal ounce bags nearly every morning this is good healthy food unlike the popular sugary cereals most americans eat i enjoy the taste and it does not leave me starving by mid morning the price is also more reasonable when i buy it by the case 
positive,13/6/20,these beans are a good find as none of our local stores carry any dried pink beans 
positive,26/9/20,i really enjoyed this product it tastes good and is very close to the russian or iranian versions also the service and quick delivery were an added bonus i would highly recommend this product 
positive,17/10/20,i was very pleased with the shipping of this item when i thought it was going to arrive after my food was empty it had actually come days prior my dog could not be happier
positive,14/12/20,my family makes a lot of ice tea during the summer we are not able to find affordable quality loose tea in our community lipton s loose tea is the best 
negative,29/5/20,lipton does taste good but it is not a good quality tea if you open the tea bag you will see their not tea leaves but tea dust cheep even the loos lipton tea is described as being broken down so you need a fine filter to strain it when you steep good tea it should unfurl and look like spinach they say this tea comes to an oz let us do the math devided by i buy my tea from set to a tea it is really good tea with flavoring and dried fruit pices it comes to an oz for a tin or for a refill weather you buy it loose or in bags you get the same quality tea i went to a tea party last year like a tupperware party but more fun where the chick told us all about the different kinds of tea and gave us samples 
positive,9/12/20,i need to watch my sodium but i am not really a fan of salty foods in the first place these almonds are perfect at half the salt i would prefer them over the regular salted almonds any day i have no idea why anyone would want to put more salt on these delicious nuts the three count ounce bags with prime shipping pop on and off of amazon buy them when they are available otherwise you must buy the six pack of small cans at a higher price per ounce 
positive,4/8/20,the steaks came well sealed and packaged and were delicious the price was right too for the size and quality of steaks that came i would recommend getting this product for the gourmet food lover in your life 
positive,31/7/20,i am happy with my purchase the mushrooms are mostly whole and have a quality shroomy smell to them not old and dusty in other words 
positive,13/6/20,i bought himalayan organic salt twice each time quality was really good and service was fast and courteous the spice lab s i will buy it again 
positive,21/11/20,so much better than other protein products in drugstores or even gnc taste great and does not fill up like other shakes do so you can work out after quickly relatively cheap for all the good things you get with it 
positive,25/5/21,i live overseas and bought this for a friend living in the usa who just had a baby recently i wanted to make an impression by sending her and her husband a nice present but not the usual clothing toys etc i decided to go with flowers but wanted to make sure they were the very best i reviewed other roses suppliers and found out that spring in the air actually cuts the roses directly from the farm in colombia and ships them right away via fedex while others are just waiting for orders to come in and their inventory is sitting in a warehouse somewhere in the usa with that said i was sure that my roses were going to live even longer probably a week or two more compared to other roses bought at amazon in addition for the price my bet was that they were going to be top quality so i gave them a try the results they exceeded my expectations and raised the bar firstly their communication goes far beyond usual amazon sellers they keep you posted on how your order is doing received being processed and sent plus they give you instructions in order to guarantee long life of the flowers nice and also advise on how to proceed if nobody is available to receive the roses when fedex first attempts to do so i wrote to the seller to see if i could have a change in the from to card i initially sent in my order and they answered promptly and nicely upon my request even on a weekend roses arrived when promised and an hour later i was receiving a phone call from my friend and her entire family saying how beautiful there roses were how fresh they look and that they had never seen roses with that outstanding quality i was relieved the plan worked perfectly thank you spring in the air i will surely buy from you again please keep up the good job great service and outstanding roses you have 
positive,25/5/21,ghee is more than an indulgence ghee can be viewed as an essential vitamin supplement albeit one that tastes really good ghee is especially necessary in a vegetarian diet in my opinion but it can be a healthy addition to any diet some research shows that ghee can even lower cholesterol i performed an extensive survey of the top ghee products available i compared quality and value ghee is so important as an addition to the diet that quality should not be sacrificed especially because only a very small amount of ghee needs to be used the ghee comparison table can be found at this blog see link in comment when i started this ghee comparison i was primarily interested in finding the best value in organic ghee products however i learned that several of the products go well beyond just organic standards it was a very pleasant surprise to find out that such high quality ghee products are available it is also great to see that my two top picks are both available on amazon com grass fed organic ghee is one of those top picks because such high quality ghees are available i focused on understanding which product is the most authentic some of the ghees are much more authentic than others the information in the table link above reflects that fact the focus of my evaluation was not gourmet cooking it was optimum health therefore i was concerned first with which ghee product is the healthiest i rank grass fed organic ghee as one of the very best products grass fed organic ghee is made in accord with the ancient traditions such as phase of the moon chanting etc it is a great quality great tasting product and the good price makes it a great value i highly recommend this ghee 
positive,20/1/21,this is a high quality ghee superior tasting and above all made from grass fed cows milk and certified organic by the usda we use it over lentils eggs sauteed veggies quinoa rice you name it and we use it tried it on whole grain toast too yummy being from grass fed cows milk it is rich in clas and boosts immunity and energy and is known to fight and obesity especially trimming the waistline this is my second time buying this and i am a consumer for life i also introduced it to my friends and they are digging the taste i really hope amazon continues to sell this product prime delivery really makes it all the more special please try it for getting healthier and also the incredible taste highly recommended 
positive,15/1/21, length mins additionally does not state grass fed but i am not so sure such a products exists this product is certainly the best alternative 
positive,8/2/21,i cannot find dragees cheaper anywhere else these are the exactly the same you would buy at a craft store for allot more 
positive,10/2/21,if you love chiles then ancho powder is a must have for any blends you may create i recommend with chipotle powder try different peppers in different amounts for amazing results 
negative,9/10/20,when i received this item i was very disappointed with it it is rather cheap looking and i would not want this on my counter for all to see the left side of the tray was lopsided and looked strange when you pulled it out needless to say i boxed it back up and sent it back for a full refund definitely not worth but after seeing it i would have been equally disappointed had i paid only 
negative,31/7/20,i had been buying these treats for my cavachon for the past two years he loved them the last batch was of noticeably lower quality dry and crunchy rather than moist and chewy i do not know if this is due to the shift in manufacturing from the us to china or coincidental in any event i will not be buying these any more and have switched to other treats note amazon would not let me return this item and i am within the day purchase period i am not pleased 
positive,13/6/20,i love this tea it is delicious and is one of my favorite teas i like its aroma and taste i drink it both after and between meals highly recommended 
positive,5/12/20,i think these taste pretty good there are lots of nuts and a few raisins in these slightly bigger than bite sized cookies you get cookies for the price so it is sort of pricey but they use quality ingredients so it is probably worth it 
positive,1/11/20,i asked my brother who is a chef how he felt about the quality of the product he received and if he could recommend it to anyone his comments were that quality was excellent and he would enjoy having it again in the future as a gift he looked at the idea of buying something similar from hickory farm in the mall where he lives since mother s day caught him and me by surprise since it arrived a week early this year and he came to the conclusion that this product was far better product than anything he could find in the mall i had thought hickory farm would work since he would have physical access to viewing any items from them and his comment was that wisconsinmade this company whose product i am reviewing did a far better job in quality and produce i think that says it for those who see only volume and not quality stay with the grocery store it will give you lots of volume if that is your criteria i will note that i bought a couple of these products from this company and i have copied the same review to each so that people will know that this company has excellent quality quality cheese and quality sausage is expensive and this company makes it well 
positive,14/1/21,we feed solid gold food to our dog on a rotating basis for some dumb reason our local pet store does not carry the sun dancer so we were glad to find it on amazon we think the solid gold company makes one of the best dog foods on the market today oh yes dog loves it too 
positive,6/6/21,i looove freshly ground nutmeg this stuff looks and smells great i have not used it yet as i am trying to rotate stock but i am sure it is good by the look and smell 
positive,21/7/20,good quality rose petal powder at a very good price i am using it as a face and body scrub as well as a mask it can be used alone or it mixes well into argan oil or any liquid soaps and lotions also highly recommend the vendor the shipment was exactly as ordered and arrived in a reasonable time 
positive,5/1/21,this is at a can the most expensive cat food that i have purchased it seemed overly expensive to me at first the cans are pretty and are only three ounces at first again that did not seem like much to me but my preconceived notions went out the window when i saw how my cats loved it the pair of kittens kindly took turns eating from one can but they scarfed it down and came and begged for more the adult cats each have been given one can a day these cats never growl at one another but when they are eating petite cuisine they growl when another approaches they finish each serving inhaling it like the nectar of the gods i am ashamed that i would never given this to them before and despite the somewhat pricey bottom line and small cans i think that this is one of the most phenomenal gifts that my cats have ever been given 
positive,23/1/21,these peppercorns were visibly of much better quality than we would gotten other places before and the aroma was tantalizing before we even opened the package they arrived fresher than i have ever tasted peppercorns in my life and the seller is very professional and quick with shipment highly recommended 
negative,31/7/20,material is very thin and the shirt had several spots where the color was faded the only thing that it had going for it was the fact that it was cheap but i guess sometimes you get what you pay for 
positive,13/6/20,how can something be so hard to find in the store good flavor good size fast delivery pleasantly surprised i will be getting more 
positive,1/12/20,i bought this organic pumpkin online because it is impossible to find pumpkin locally i feed my dogs this every day because it is wonderful for their digestion pumpkin was recommended by my vet all of the cans were in great condition there were just a few minor dents on a few of the cans not anything serious the quality of the pumpkin was so good that i would serve it to my family but we really do not eat pumpkin an added plus was free shipping i would buy this again 
positive,30/1/21,i was worried after ordering this product since so many reviews complained about dented cans but i ordered when the price was right and took the chance out of cans only one was dented the expiration date on the cans i received very happy with the quality of this pumpkin 
positive,1/1/21,my dogs are doxies they love them the larger sizes the seem to be good for them and they love them
positive,11/1/21,my parents were very satisfied with the steak and i was happy with the delivery time 
negative,31/7/20,i go through a lot of coconut milk and this is the only brand i will buy because native forest is the only company i know of that uses bpa free cans however the product is very inconsistent sometime i get wonderful rich thick coconut milk and other times its watery curdled and gritty the watery stuff does not do well in my recipes at all i saw other reviewers said it has to do with whether the cans came from sri lanka or thailand i will not be ordering these from amazon even though it is more expensive at the store i want to be able to make sure i am getting the thick coconut milk it is really unacceptable that two completely different products are being sold as the same product 
positive,13/6/20,the salt is great quality and taste if you have not already stooped using table salt sodium chloride i urge you to read about the benefits of using himalayan salt not only does it taste better it is much better for your health 
positive,14/1/21,ordered twice and both times they have been excellent they are fresh and non broken not much more to say other than that definitely will buy again 
positive,7/12/20,all the cooking shows tell you it is important not to skimp on the vanilla extract this is the good stuff at a good price 
positive,5/5/21,it definitely met my expectations i thought the quality was great for the price i paid i would definitely buy this again from this company 
negative,23/11/20,i just received my pack of bulbs and of the do not work and another one has debris floating in the tube the bulbs that work appear do work well however there is no excuse for poor quality back they go 
negative,29/8/20,sorry for the long delay i really do not like to write negative comments but this was delivered to my mother in law stale and bad she threw it out 
positive,18/1/21,good quality cashews but lots of salt which seems common with any brand of salted cashews mostly it is whole cashews very few pieces 
positive,18/6/21,my wife makes a shepard pie with this the wholesome taste is so good 
positive,18/6/21,i had no idea exactly how much a pound of flowers would be great quality and very plentiful arrived in an airtight bag so i am sure it will stay fresh for months i use it with mint to make wanjo 
positive,7/7/21,good product that we are all accustomed to at a very reasonable price i do have to be cautious to not over salt when using this so i tend to use more fresh garlic and add this in lieu of salt in equal quantities 
positive,18/6/21,i love the bitter taste of chocolate so i did some research on cocoa and found mostly positive reviews of raw cocoa i did however find one negative review saying that theobromide the primary stimulant in cocoa is unhealthy and has similar side effects as caffeine i got the powder anyways to dispel the mystery myself while i did have a small crash afterwards after tablespoons the surge in energy that i felt was definitely worth it it was not the jittery surge i was warned about and the crash actually helps me sleep if i time it right not to mention the taste is so good and yet mild that i could eat it by the spoonful on its own thinking that was the end of it i also ordered cocoa nibs terrible mistake i do not know exactly why but i got the exact side effects i was warned about not to mention the energy was lower in quality this is definitely the better alternative 
positive,7/7/21,there is a lot of variability in the quality of macadamians even from the same producer i have only received one bag of these but they are perfect i have run across many that have had varying degrees of bitterness usually accompanied by an unnaturally hard consistency as though they had been harvested too early not these they have perfect consistency and flavor the vast majority are whole as opposed to halves or smaller pieces update i have now ordered about bags over a period of about a year the quality has be consistently excellent i use macadamia nuts as a regular part of my diet they preferentially reduce bad cholesterol due to their high content of monounsaturated fats they are low in carbs and have very few simple carbs so they will not only take the edge off your appetite they will help keep it off unlike most nuts they are low in oxalate which means regular use will not increase the risk of kidney stones pistachios and walnuts are also low in oxalate the only catch is that their high healthy fat content means high calorie count per unit volume to dodge that bullet i just ration them out as opposed to absentmindedly eating from a large container this is a great product i am happy to give them yet another star review 
positive,1/7/21,best quality oil i have encountered i was impressed with the packaging for shipping nice job 
positive,7/7/21,great culinary cooking got it with a lavender cook book and have been impressing my friends with the gentle subtle flavor of the lavender a little goes a long way and there is a lot of lavender here so it can easily be used for all sorts of dishes makes a great way with a little sugar to brighten up a lavender margarita rim the glass with the crushed lavender instead of salt 
positive,23/7/21,i purchased this lavendar for my daughter s bumblebee themed baby shower to make lavender honey scones which i did and they were a huge success there were no leftovers but then i got creative and exploded with lavendar recipes our favorite so far has been a roasted pork loin on the grill yum 
positive,20/7/21,i grew up in an italian household and this was the only pasta my father would cook with it was always available in the grocery store on the east coast when i lived there i rarely see it where i live now in the mid west when i do it is outrageously priced and a very limited selection i love this pasta and ordering it online is cheaper and easier than going out to the store i also use subscribe and save which reduces the price even more and there is no shipping cost it is a staple in our house the quality is excellent cooked as directed the pasta holds its form and texture it does not become mushy or fall apart even if you like your pasta soft and not al dente it holds in shape 
negative,19/7/21,the packaging was intact and all but when i opened the box i found that the greenies were stuck together and would not break apart even when i tried smashing them against the concrete at some point they must have been moist that they had become so cemented together it is a struggle trying to pull one at a time out of the bag and they break apart not exactly what i wanted 
positive,18/6/21,these apricots are great quality very plump and sweet with a little bit of tang i ordered these on a tuesday and received them on thursday very prompt shipping and great product if you love apricots try theses for sure 
positive,7/7/21,this flour is very fresh tasting and consistent in quality when i order anything from bob s red mill i know i am getting the best available product 
negative,27/6/21,i ordered this product for my niece as one of her christmas presents when i opened the ups package the handle to the gingerbread box was broken the box was also dented in places the taste of the icing was horrible however it was a fun project and none of the gingerbread pieces were broken would not buy again 
positive,21/7/21,received product very quickly the k cups taste fresh and robust compared to other keurig cartridges i will definitely be ordering for my office again 
positive,18/6/21,i have recently been experimenting with traditional pilsner styles these came extremely quick were fresh and produced just what i was looking for
positive,7/7/21,product was clean and in a good package as i could not find this item locally i looked to amazon price seemed a touch high except i have not shopped mung dal recently and that might not be fair in any event i was glad to get it anyway i purchased it with tumric spice also and was impressed by the packaging on both items these people seem to take care of their products 
positive,30/6/21,high quality dog food i feed lamb as it is easier on their disgestion i highly recommend this if you have small dogs 
positive,1/7/21,i bought this stuff at my local co op i have used a lot of coconut oils and this brand is my favorite i am a coconut lover so i get the whole kernel version but there is a lighter version as well i use this oil for my skin cooking baking and just eating plain it is good stuff 
positive,24/8/21,the small can in which the olive oil is stored are very handy and does perserve the fresh flavor of this very good oil the quality of this oil is high enough to use it as a dipping sauce especially when mixed with fresh herbs 
positive,21/7/21,received the product fast the taste was as expected for this type of cheese good texture flavor slightly dry excellent for grating over salads and seafood and pasta 
positive,25/6/21,i do not sprout these or anything just use about a tablespoon when feeling nauseated from taking my multi vitamin on an empty stomach works wonders also a testosterone booster and rich 
negative,13/9/21,did not like flavor left significant residue in cup and flow was limited into cup tried and plan to return very disappointing
positive,18/6/21,i may not be a culinary expert but i know taste this basil has a more intense and better flavor than i had experienced with any other dried basil i highly recommend it 
positive,7/7/21,this syrup is really good it has a lot of flavor without being overly sweet one or two pumps is enough to give my espressos a rich butterscotch flavor i would recommend it if you are looking for a syrup that will compliment your concoctions without overpowering it with sugar 
positive,15/7/21,i am a kinder chocolate fan from way back and it is hard to come by in the us but this shipment was fresh and arrived timely way to go 
positive,11/7/21,this is a staple in our gluten free household it is great for converting non gluten free recipes to gluten free recipes and getting good texture easy to use i am very happy to have found it 
positive,7/10/21,not only is this a great deal but the pineapple is delicious emerald does a great job and each piece looks great and is nice and juicy i would just warn people to be aware of the sugar content because there is per serving 
negative,6/7/21,i had purchased the premium variety of these treats when costco carried them and my dogs loved them i bought the original recipe treats here because the premium was too expensive what i recieved was a bag filled with broken and crumbled pieces and a lot of dust amazon shipped it thrown in with several books with no padding around it one of my dogs flatly refuses to eat the treat pieces the other dog would eat sawdust if i offered it to him which makes me think they have gone bad since i cannot find a use by date on the package i do not trust that this is a wholesome safe product the remainder has gone into the rubbish for the safety of your animals i advise that you not purchase these from amazon i believe they sell old product 
positive,18/6/21,this is an excellent quality product it makes lunch or a snack time very easy and convenient as well as nutricious love this product awesome for controlling portions for anyone looking to maintain weight as well 
positive,7/7/21,high quality product the dog loves them and they are made in the usa they do have a strong fish smell however 
negative,27/7/21,the quality of these cups were awful several of them broke open in my keurig brewer and leaked grounds into my coffee this has not happened with any other brand of k cups 
positive,13/7/21,these nuts came very fast and their freshness is very good i use them to make a vegan whip toping 
positive,13/9/21,this seller consistently provides high quality edibles for very reasonable prices and this fleur de sel is no exception extremely tasty well packaged and timely delivery 
positive,7/9/21,i think this is what salt is supposed to taste like mild and not biting it gives food a more subtle flavoring very nice 
positive,17/4/21,purchased these for my husband who loves to use maple syrup in his oatmeal they are small but nice and by the time you have used one up do not need to worry about sticky buildup these would be great for taking on trips or camping there are of them and they are encased in opaque plastic and pour very well we love the quality of the flavor good maple syrup is pricey these days yet i think the cost in comparison to other high quality syrups is competitive i would purchase again 
negative,10/3/21,some of the cinnamon sticks have patches of mold other sticks smell like smoke not cinnamon previous orders were okay but this batch will be my last purchase of this brand grocery stores sometimes pull questionable products from the shelves until quality issues are resolved with the supplier there needs to be an equivalent online response 
negative,17/4/21,i have long haired dachshunds which like to dig out in the beginning the fido worked but was not powerful as it would not shock through the long haired coat of my dachshunds they had to hit it with the face or shorter haired skin exposed underbelly areas in order to get a good reaction on them i had the fido set up for maybe months before it stopped working completely and the dogs were back to getting out again no it did not get wet as my husband built a wood box for the charger house of protection it just stopped working and by that time i had thrown away my receipt which was from a small garden center on an old type register so that it did not list the product name anyway thus no warranty proof nor refund available i am looking for a better quality charger which will hit harder through the long haired coat i have had stronger chargers which worked better and lasted longer than this model the fido 
positive,21/1/21,this most definitely is a green tea of superior quality it is economical in that its yield is a bit stronger than average one need not double up bags to get a decent flavour 
positive,30/1/21,this item comes securely packaged in three separate bags the quality is a good value for the price 
positive,13/2/21,gluten free corn thins are incredibly tasty and low in calories they are a good replacement for bread or any crackers 
negative,15/1/21,unfortunately i believed that by looking at the packaging i was getting the old style gum which has a lesser chance of sticking to the paper when carried in my pocket for a few days than the new cheap gum i loose more gum now because it sticks to the paper after i have carried it in my pocket for a few days the old gum was less likely to stick to the paper under the very same conditions needless to say i am quite dissapointed in wrigley s decision to cut the quality of their doublemint gum and also needless to say this will be my last purchase of any wrigley s products they had a good gum before if it are not broke do not fix it 
negative,6/3/21,the first time i ordered this it was great after adjusting my grind it made the perfect espresso with a thick crema however subsequent orders left much to be desired some were ok some were horrible none were great 
positive,8/6/21,i was pleased when amazon decided to sell community coffee since i long ago decided it was the best of the rich strong flavored louisiana coffees the private reserve coffees community coffee sells are quite good just as i remembered them being when i lived in baton rouge many many years ago community coffees offer a consistently rich flavorful roast the price is reasonable especially with amazon s subscribe and save program i make my own blends of sumatran french roast columbian and espresso and am very happy with the results 
positive,7/1/21,the product was recieved in a timely manner the product was in good condition and the item was in good shape quality was good great price
negative,17/4/21,i bought this product from target after i had done what i thought was enough research on baby food makers i was originally going to get the baby bullet but the reviews were not good at all so i went with the brezza instead mistake i remember that a few people had written about the poor quality and bad customer service of the company itself not amazon when i opened it the tape used to secure it within the plastic bag was melted so there was sticky stuff all over the bottom of the thing i had to scrub it as soon as i took it out of the box after it had gotten sticky melted tape all over my kitchen counter that was annoying the plastic covering over the buttons looked like it was lifting as if it had been used or something even though it was brand new i tried the motor and it worked it was not terribly loud i would probably rate the noise a on a scale when i went to wash it prior to first use of course the directions said to remove the driveshaft prior to washing it said all you had to do was to turn the canister over find the knob and turn counter clock wise that driveshaft must have been welded in there because it took me and my husband over an hour to loosen it enough to get it out of there i was honestly scared to put it back in for fear that i would never get it back out again i got over it and prepared to make my first meal carrots i followed the directions and cut up the carrots to the appropriate size but when i went to put the water in there was a discrepancy the directions said to put in of water and that the canister had a premeasured line that could be used so the amount of water would be correct normally that would not be a problem except that the measured line read seriously so i am left trying to figure out which one is correct i ended up going with the premeasured canister and i think that it was too much water because the carrots came out ridiculously watery there were also still chunks of carrot in the mix it was not easy to get the food out around the blades either i can see how people would say that it might be a time saver if it worked and was of decent quality then it would save time you just set it and walk away but the end result leaves much to be desired and for the price you would expect to at least get your money s worth you are honestly better off just getting a really nice food processor and going the old fashioned way 
positive,10/3/21,this curry powder has a nice well blended flavor and it is hot without being too hot it adds a nice variety to many of my dishes espeically fried rice which i eat quite often 
negative,14/1/21,this candy had previously been melted candy was stuck to wrappers this would be ok to eat but not to share with friens 
negative,24/5/21,i have always enjoyed timothys coffee however the quality of this box was unacceptable out of k cups failed while brewing coming loose at the edge and making a huge mess on my counter top i will not be purchasing this brand of coffee again 
positive,14/10/21,these were freakin awesome all lbs were top quality and better than many restaurants ordering my second batch now how i prepare them place several legs in a pot of boiling water for about a minute or less if you stir them they are already cooked so you just want to heat them up cooking them further will ruin them the end piece will piece will take a bit longer 
positive,7/2/21,love this stuff i use it for everything awesome in the kitchen especially in brownies great in the bathroom for a hair mask i buy this all the time 
positive,29/3/21,this is an excellent product and a good price i have been using coconut oil in most of my cooking now 
positive,17/4/21,good packaging fresh product received befor scheduled date these are my favorite potato chips since i was a little girl i cannot find them anywhere in my region of the state so ordering them from amazon was my only option they did a great job i am totally satisfied 
negative,10/3/21,i am always looking for healthy treats for my dogs i had ordered boxes of these and when i opened the first box something had eaten their way in or out the treats were full of holes and there were also holes in the plastic i could not see from the outside any evidence of something getting in they were also out of date by a couple of months i contacted the the people that i purchased these from and they wasted no time in giving me a refund i was very please with the seller s response 
positive,10/7/21,this is a quality product that my dog adores i like it because i can make a little or a lot we use this to supplement kibble as she is not on a raw diet i used to make food or use a high quality can food but find the addiction to be a lot more convenient besides that i do not like the smell of can food this comes in plastic bags that you cannot reseal so be prepared to transfer to an airtight container 
negative,27/1/21,i love these strawberries but this batch came up short on flavoring the candy did not even small like strawberries just tasted like gummi sugar somehow this batch got missed when they added flavoring i will try them again vendor shipped fast and they were very fresh 
positive,1/6/21,the peppercorns arrived in a nice resealable bag and are of good quality it is difficult to compare them to other peppercorns but they do the job and they are organic so that is all good in my book 
positive,20/8/21,great taste and great quality smells wonderful i saved my store bought container and re used it for these grinds so easy in my pepper grinder 
positive,14/8/21,i bought these to make homemade peanut butter it turned out wonderfully my month old daughter loves it on her waffles 
positive,21/4/21,i have purchased the zoe evoo in cans regular and organic many times in the past and been very satisfied i like this zoe arbequina evoo even better as far as taste goes it is very flavorful somewhat grassy with no bitter taste and has a smooth silky texture it is more of a rich yellow color than green it is a great all purpose oil that holds up to sauteeing drizzling over cooked pasta for use in salad dressings and for bread dipping it is also pretty economical to use for all kitchen uses especially when purchased on subscription basis this comes in a clear bottle not my preference for storage of olive oils so i have wrapped the bottles with foil to minimize light exposure and slow degradation oils can also be stored in the refrigerator or freezer to maintain quality 
positive,1/4/21,i have used of the bags so far and have been pleasantly surprised at how few bad beans are in each bag excellent quality 
positive,17/4/21,these bean are wonderful they are very moist and smell amazing i started making a batch of homemade vanilla extract and the color is already a dark amber only after a few days will definetly buy again 
positive,10/3/21,used for vanilla extract for christmas gifts excellent quality especially for the price definitely would order again and recommend others to order 
positive,22/4/21,i was very impressed with the quality of the vanilla beans i received not only were they at least less expensive than the beans in grocery specialty stores but the beans were plump and very flavorful i also received my order very quickly sooner than the seller stated i will definitely be back to buy my next batch of vanilla beans here 
positive,25/4/21,this is excellent quality caster sugar very fine great price is a must have for making shortbread cookies 
positive,1/4/21,i made rum soaked worms for a tgif for my building and they were a big hit really good texture and taste just plain too
negative,30/6/21,this item shipped quickly and looked nice but it fell apart after about two weeks look elsewhere for a komboloi 
positive,1/3/21,definitely the way to go when you buy the base unit grasses last a long time if you give good light and sufficient water i would not buy this without the base to save money though because the wooden base keeps the grass tray from moving and tipping over when kitties munch on it good quality great value 
positive,29/1/21,i regularly order this soy milk product and use it with granola cereal it is great by itself as well be sure to serve chilled it has a strong vanilla flavor which i like i keep thinking that i am going to get tired of it but it still tastes great each and every carton 
negative,17/4/21,a friend got the everlasting treat ball and extra refills for my dog my dog is not a destructive chewer but he had chunks of the blue part torn out within min it makes me mad when i think of how much it and the replacement treats cost and now it is trash that is why i am writing this review 
positive,10/3/21,fromm is outstanding quality food you know how when starting a dog on a new type of food you need to wean them into the new food by giving a little bit at first and then more and more fromm is such great quality that it does not have a transition time i have a dog with a very sensitive stomach and i can tell the quality of a food by whether he will get gi issues after first eating it he can eat fromm with no problems at all 
positive,30/5/21,i bought these noodles at an overstock store once and had i known at the time how good they were going to be i would have stocked up as it stands unless you live near an asian market or similar store you will have a difficult time getting these locally fortunately amazon provides all of the varieties are very good this one brings out the savory flavor of the mushrooms and the texture of the bean thread noodles is satisfying it prepares quick and easy and only requires boiling water like a typical self contained ramen bowl great for work and quite filling for the size and price 
positive,28/9/21,this condiment rocks tasty spicy and hot loving it just ordered the pack has won a long time customer i put this chili oil on raman noodles with pork and green onion a little ginger and a little hoisin and fish sauce and you got yourself a delicious meal star for sure

positive,20/4/21,i used these tablets during a demonstration for a talk i gave about taste to a group of student chefs needless to say they were amazed and pleased with the effects the tablets were easy to distribute and very effective in turning lemons into candy thanks 
positive,20/4/21,when i first adopted my dog i did a vast amount of research to find out what was truly best to feed him he is a chihuahua mix and as i was reading such mixed reviews about whether small dogs would benefit from a high protein diet or not i decided i just had to try it for myself he did have a little trouble with digestion while i was transitioning him to the food he was eating royal canin prior he is been eating it for about seven months now and he is doing phenomenal he has great muscle tone and energy his coat is silky and shinny when it had been coarse and dull yes it is on the pricey side but if you closely watch what you put in your body as humans why would not you want your best friend to benefit from great food 
positive,21/4/21,i was anxious to try making my own ijera at home after living in ethiopia for months and have had fairly good success with this tef flour it is the dark variety but i enjoy the great almost mocha flavor i can tell it is fresh because it develops a good sour starter on its own without needing to add any additional sourdough starter or yeast 
negative,2/5/21, asin i purchase these probably year ago i was very disappointed with the quality i was unable to eat these sardines they had scales and hard bones along with a tough texture sorry product i am giving them to the cats crown prince natural skinless boneless sardines in pure olive oil ounce cans pack of 
negative,25/5/21,i purchased this item because i wanted the tea chest the item description is completely inaccurate it states that it is a wood grain tea chest the chest is a cheap box that is very poorly covered with a wood grain contact paper i say poorly because the faux wood contact paper has ripples and bubbles all over it please do not waste your money or time on this item like i did 
positive,7/9/21,i am really happy with this product and will definitely buy more products from andean treasures in the future this is a good high quality product that tastes amazing in shakes incredibly fast shipping as well i ordered late friday evening and received it early mon morning 
positive,25/5/21,excellent product bob s red mill brand is the best i have bought flaxseed from other suppliers and have bought them from well known health food stores only to bite into what seems like pieces of dirt gathered along with the seed i never have that problem when i purchase this brand good value for the money 
positive,22/5/21,the quality of the almonds is so much better than my local supermarkets i just started eating raw almonds and i did not think i would be able to tell the difference between suppliers besides the great quality the pricing is good too 
positive,19/7/21,i find these are excellent quality almonds at a resonable price they are really going fast going to have to order more soon 
negative,7/9/21,i ordered two boxes and the k cups are less than half filled with coffee sounds more like little maracas also leaves grounds at the bottom of cup apparently there is not a return policy for these k cups very bummed out 
negative,25/8/21,this item comes in a pkg of bags the first one was like dust it even smelled like dust when i ground the beans no coffee scent at all i just opened the bag and it does smell like coffee and much better taste too but it is so not worth having to throw away an entire bag that makes the cost per pound way more than this coffee is worth 
positive,6/9/21,i purchased these ears because of the excellent price and was shocked to see the quality each ear was individually wrapped like one of the reviews mentioned also fresh i love the fact that they are individually wrapped you can take them with you the dachshunds and lab love them i definitely would purchase this brand again 
negative,25/5/21,my dog hates this food and through some research i have found that science diet is not very good quality i have instead switched over to orijen a little more expensive but worth it for a healthier and happier dog 
positive,7/9/21,i love the honey i bought i bought bottles of it hope next time i can let them deliver them as soon as possible 
positive,13/10/21,these dates are as close as you can get without picking them off the tree yourself they are also much cheaper than the nearly lb at local stores that are not even organic great deal for a great product 
positive,2/10/21,i have used almost every india tree item and have had wonderful results with their products taste and quality in conjunction with excellent amazon service and delivery makes the decision to purchase a no brainer 
negative,23/9/21,a majority of the pods are defective they either do not have enough air pressure in the pod which results in non consistent coffee taste or they are poorly sealed which results in coffee spilling out the side of the pod into your keurig either way i will never order this brand again 
positive,26/6/21,i am a huge fan of navitas brand products the quality of the cacao is top notch and will be the brand i get from here on out love it
positive,25/5/21,i bought these for a bridal shower for gift bags i received the item quickly and the chocolate was perfectly wrapped another review noted that some of the wrappers were broken i only had maybe where i had to fix the wrapper i thought they looked great i am giving it stars only because i do feel as though it is overpriced for what you get 
positive,7/9/21,love this bag perfect size i have been using it to make a gallon of fresh almond milk every days for the last weeks and it works great super fine mesh makes a super smooth milk and it rinses clean in a snap the seams are very well sewn unlike others i have seen where the thread is already unraveling so i expect it will hold up for a good long time i bought more to give to my mother and my sister 
positive,15/7/21,i use a lot of seeds for making breads salad dressings and in other cooking these are excellent sesame seeds the only drawback is that it takes a while to use up two packages and unless you are careful to keep the seeds cool and out of the sun they lose a little quality after a few months toast them to bring out the flavor grind them up when making salad dressings and add them to your other ingredients to add new flavor to your dressings i toss a handful into salads onto cooked vegetable or add them to marinades for poultry and meats sesame is very versatile and healthy eating 
positive,3/6/21,if you need small amount this bottle is enough for to pinches good quality it sealed with a cork and clear plastic wrap on top i generally use it for arroz caldo and some spanish dishes like paella product of spain gm per bottle around six bucks a bottle at the store 
positive,27/9/21,these glazed walnuts are always fresh and amazon has the best price on them i use them in a salad i make and they are always a hit joe

positive,25/5/21,quality gum ball machine i am very happy with it solid glass and classic look it is a christmas gift for my daughter and a great way to show her how to save money plus she gets a little reward 
negative,7/9/21,i received this product and eagerly offered the dog the first biscuit out of the box she stepped back and walked away without hesitating i smelled the biscuit and it had a rancid peanut butter smell to it i checked the other in the box and they all smelled the same bad what a shame since we had purchased these previously and the dog enjoyed them i will not be purchasing anymore online and will stay with the local pet store for fresh treats 
positive,3/8/21,the tiny bubbles and flavor choice makes this an above average non alcholic beverage others tend to be more like soda pop 
positive,5/9/21,its great to use as a base for homemade deodorant body powder fyi talc is poisonous and is the main ingredient in most body powders 
positive,25/5/21,thanks for the speedy shipping got the products right on time very high quality maple syrup i will definitely buy coombs brand maple syrup from amazon again 
negative,7/9/21,i did not like the bob s red mill golden flax seed because it had too many pieces of stems and dark discolored flax seeds in it i thought the price compared to some other sellers was too high i will not purchase this product again 
negative,11/9/21,i drink tea everyday and was excited to find such a great deal on this tea regrettably the only good part about this tea was the price the tea tastes somewhat bitter and earthy and not in a good way and is weak also i will not buy this again and will stick to pg tips or yorkshire gold 
positive,13/7/21,i use it frequently and it is hard to find locally it is great for baked goods i would this purchase again 
positive,22/7/21,for those into nutritional suppliments this is a good quality product at a fair price from our mid western region 
positive,22/6/21,quality fruit great texture not a brick on the top of my reorder list highly recommend to all who love a lite fruit cake
positive,28/7/21,the candy was fresh and well packaged i divided into smaller ziploc bags to keep it from going stale i have no idea how long it would take to go stale but i was not taking any chances and we ate it over the following months with no complaints i just placed an order for another lb bag 
positive,13/10/21,i have used fenugreek in the past to increase milk production when i was breast feeding while i am currently not breastfeeding i decided to start taking it again the reason it makes your body odors smell like maple syrup as weird as this may seem i just wanted to be able to sweat and not smell like onions and this did the job after taking it for one day no side effects other than it does seem to make your bust fuller not drastically hardly noticeable but i can tell a slight difference i gave it stars since this particular brand seems to be pretty potent compared to what i used to take i noticed the maple syrup smell after a few days with the old stuff this worked after one day and does not have a weird smell to it making it easy for me to swallow 
positive,19/2/21,i do not normally use honey but i drink a fair amount of tea and wanted something healthier than white sugar or products like splenda etc just got two one pound jars of really raw honey and i must say it is much nicer than what i am used to at the local grocery store it is packed in glass jars which is the proper way to pack honey it can absorb things from plastics plus its totally unfiltered yet seems more sophisticated in both taste and texture than the super market stuff it is a solid so it is less messy than the liquid variety i just made a cup of tea and dipped a spoon into the honey and it scoops easily up and melted into my tea right away if you think honey is too cumbersome to use reconsider i cannot honestly say this brand is better than others in its class but it is definitely nicer than the typical filtered liquid plastic squeeze container variety found in most super market brands addendum april my latest jars have been sizes these have been packed in plastic not glass jars unlike my jars were if this is of concern to you contact mfgr to ask about glass jar options edit feb i should add that i buy direct from really raw their price includes shipping within the continental us fyi
positive,14/12/20,i wanted to learn how to use gluten in making wheat bread and chose this brand because of the positive reviews i read on amazon the quality is good and seems to work well i would have loved it if this product came with some recipes and tips 
positive,14/12/20,packaged well healthy on arrival and have held up a month later kl design provided great support shipped quickly great communication and when they realized a mistake was made for the cost of shipping kl corrected the issue before i even realized there was a mistake i would definitely buy from them again 
positive,19/2/21,these were as i remember them totally yummy they came quickly they were well packaged with mylar bubble wrap and a small ice pack to keep them fresh ordering anything from this shop is safe and worry free thank you 
positive,10/1/21,had a box of their garlic sticks and really enjoyed the quality and satisfying feeling from eating them wanted to try a new flavor and the sesame is quite addicting only weight watchers points for incredible sticks these are made in italy expect many of the breadsticks to be broken but do not let this stop you from trying this premium brand 
negative,26/3/21,these are not the york peppermint patties that i am accustomed to they are very noticeably made of lower quality ingredients after i took a single bite i could tell something was wrong so i checked the packaging and sure enough these are manufactured in mexico i saw on another variety here on amazon that people were complaining about the quality of the made in mexico york peppermint patties this product is a waste of money 
positive,24/3/21,this is a great bargain the beans are all terrific and look very fresh and clean i would have given it five stars if only it were easier to store lol its kind of a bulky heavy bag but hey its still great and i have not had a single batch fail me i will order this item again for sure 
positive,24/2/21,love this product highly recommended this is now our bottle this is concentrate so it lasts a while we mix with water or ice tea 
positive,19/2/21,very happy with these beans they are very fresh very fragrant and arrived quickly i used the whole package to make a gigantic batch of vanilla extract to give as christmas gifts i split all the beans lengthwise and added them to a ml bottle of vodka shaking about once per week for several months to package i strain the extract through a goldtone coffee filter into a gift sized bottle and add a section of vanilla bean to the bottle the flavor is excellent and much cheaper than buying vanilla extract at the store also i put any leftover pieces of vanilla bean into my sugar canister leave them out to dry first for yummy vanilla sugar highly recommended 
negative,14/12/20,this is the second time i have ordered this product the first time i thought it was very good this time however it tastes as though it has been watered down the consistency is thinner and the taste is weaker i will not purchase this again 
negative,19/10/21,i carefully read all the reviews on this item before ordering i must say there are not that many real tea drinkers writing reviews for this particular item sure if you are a lipton dipper this is a great tea but if you know what a quality tea should offer you would not have given this product more than stars the aroma when first open the bag is quiet decent but when the tea is brewed the flavor is a disaster it is basically a lipton like flavor the color is also unlike a good quality earl gray which it should have an amber color that can be anywhere from light to deep end of the spectrum depending if the tea is a single body or need to be mixed with another tea for potentiation of color at last the tea leaves are not uniformly sized which basically means this tea is probably a mixture of low quality teas just flavored as earl gray coffee bean direct should consider offering a better tea for a few more at least of tea would be worth brewing 
positive,18/5/21,comes vacuum packed in a foil package inside wooden box flavor is excellent and really could not be better 
positive,19/2/21,fine quality but expensive you can find the same amount for price at places like trader joe s 
negative,14/12/20,i did not purchase this from amazon although i was about to since the pack is so much cheaper than buying individual bags at the grocery store so i thought i would try a couple of bags to see how i liked them the first bag was wonderful plump sweet juicy pieces of ginger nicely sweetened with a good hot ginger hit the second bag was awful mushy ginger and some pieces with strange unnatural textures and the ginger was way too hot in that second bag not sure what is going on but i also tried a couple of bags of the reed s and liked their ginger much much better and the quality was consistent 
positive,1/6/21,i have enjoyed many pr s up to dollars a pound and have a very good sense of quality this is about an month as stated it is on the mild side which is quite special in itself it has a fresh wonderful buttery taste of a fresh pr there is individual merit for the various ages up to months i personally do not like the months variety this is a bargain and to be well appreciated pay the next day during the hot months mt second order weeks later was not fresh dried out not the young freshness and tenderness of a month did not taste good why we really like these cheese the third shipment was perfect 
positive,1/4/21,hi bought these for my parents and i am glad that i made right choice parents as well as myself i eat them regularly i eat my whey protein powder in milk before i mix these cereals my father has diabetes but he has no complaints 
positive,15/4/21,i ordered these to make sachets for baby shower favors i added my own sage and lavender colored ribbon after filing them with lavender from the same supplier they look like i spent a fortune on them but i did not i have left overs which i plan on using for gifts tea bags and also to make oil infusions with i am quite pleased with them 
positive,19/5/21,these are excellent quality bags heavy tight weave minimal if any floaties i use them primarily for tea if you decide to purchase them you will not be disappointed 
positive,19/2/21,i have purchased cheaper bags since buying these which work well these are thicker and cheaper here than at a pet store 
positive,14/12/20,i shared this with my daughter and her family we enjoy the smooth mellow taste good hot or cold we enjoy high quality speciality loose teas and this is equal to tevanas 
positive,28/7/21,i love this canola oil organic canola is hard to find and this is pricey but it is worth it to me i will be ordering again soon

positive,20/7/21,this purchased was well package arrived undamaged and in a timely manner the product was the best solid white albacore tuna i have ever had it was much better than the name brands in my local markets i have already placed a second order i highly recommend this product 
positive,12/10/21,i ordered several products from superior nut company including these milk chocolate covered gummy bears i was skeptical ordering something like chocolate over the mail but they arrived unscathed and very fresh i do alot of baking and i will definitely be buying from this seller again fair prices excellent product 
positive,19/2/21,i compared so many different dog food brands before i settled on blue buffalo i used to feed my swiss mountain dogs holistic anchovy until they changed the recipe to include pork and chicken meal presumably to save blue buffalo has none of that in it and it gets delivered to my front door in two days with amazon prime call me a nut but i always taste the food i feed my dogs so i can get a real idea of what i am feeding them because let us be honest most of our dogs would eat anything that you put in front of them let us just say that blue buffalo had a lot more of an authentic fish and oatmeal taste and texture than holistic or eagle pack did i also add a little pro biotic to their food to help with digestion i will be buying blue buffalo in the future for my boys 
positive,14/12/20,we sent this basket to my mother in law for mother s day and she loved it i was worried because she will definitely let us know if she does not like something and she really raved about this i did not see the basket in person but she said the items in it were all very nice she was most excited about a package of soap petals that was included she said they looked just like dried flowers but you use one petal at a time as soap she will be using those in her guest bathroom the food items were all really good quality and there was a really nice picture frame in the box too she also raved about the box itself and plans on using it on it is own this is the art of appreciation gift basket i have sent as gifts and i always get good responses so i would feel confident about sending this as a gift 
positive,2/7/21,this white rice flour is fine instead of coarse like some great for baked goods my gluten free sugar cookies and shortbread cookies turn out excellent 
positive,11/3/21,fast delivery and excellent quality you can use the cinnamon in traditional recipes on cereal vebetables etc it naturally has a somewhat sweet taste to it 
negative,10/4/21,after being pleased with my first order of these rawhides i set up a recurring order for them we received a box last week and were disappointed to find that the quality of these bones is not the same as the first order the first order of bones contained rawhides that were tightly rolled and long lasting but these have inner layers that are brittle and easily broken one of our dogs actually cut her mouth or gums on the brittle shards we did not realize it until we saw blood on the bone itself amazon is refunding the purchase price i may try one more time with this brand if anyone has found a consistent quality brand at this kind of price please let us know maybe my budget is the problem 
positive,22/7/19,package was received at expected time more importantly the walnuts are fresh of good size and excellent flavor no preservatives such as bht which some other companies use 
negative,2/2/20,i have bought vanilla beans for several years for making homemade ice cream i always buy from amazon because the supermarket vanilla beans are usually old and expensive i just received my order of these and was very disappointed the beans were stiff not pliable as a good vanilla bean should be they did not have an oily feel to them which is another sign of quality and freshness also there were less of the seeds that you get from the inside of the bean which is where most of the flavor comes from compared to previous purchases i have made finally they did not have a very strong vanilla aroma no where near as strong as other vanilla beans that i have bought in the past i just used beans from the last order i bought well over a year ago along with these vanilla beans that i just ordered the old ones were much better in quality than these new ones despite being quite a bit older i always vacuum seal the beans after i use them to help keep their freshness but the other vanilla beans are still well over a year older than these new ones and were far better in quality 
positive,2/2/20,i only write reviews when i get crappy product crappy service or excellent product and service these beans were moist and plump the smell is heavenly in fact i placed the envelope they were mailed in into my lingerie drawer because throwing it away seemed to be a huge waste of fragrance i have placed the beans in vodka and bourbon and altough it will be some time before i have vanilla extract i am excited about the end result i could not believe how quickly the beans arrived i have bought books that were shipped from a few states over that took times as long to get here and cost more to ship i will definitely order from this company again and again and again 
positive,31/8/19,i recently discovered freeze dried foods and these garlic bits are very nice yes expensive but i mainly use them when i bake bread these do taste like garlic and re hydrate very well target carries a line of freeze dried herbs cost a little cheaper and get little more and i will compare those to these 
positive,22/7/19,i loved these peanuts they were just so good all of them and they came just as advertised 
positive,12/1/20,i am a tuna snob this tuna is close in quality to the best tuna i have had and works well for making large qauntities when the best tuna is cost prohibitive i mix with cannelini beans olive oil generous amount and chopped red onions for a great meal with greens or bread or both 
positive,19/2/20,good quality product i was having difficulty finding hungarian paprika in the local markets amazon offered a wide variety of this product the multi container offer was set at a good price i am quite satisfied i would order it again

positive,26/9/20,i use lots of bay leaves when cooking and find many brands lack the bright pungency that adds a special touch to a dish these have a nice bright green color they flavor dishes quite nicely i was surprised to find that these were as good as those of spice islands which i have tended to prefer over all other brands 
positive,22/7/19,this is one of the best traditional pasta sauces around usually i would mix some oregano some basil and some garlic powder to give my gravy some taste but this does not need any additional items it is great just out of the jar 
negative,2/2/20,the fruit arrived in a timely fashion but much of the fruit was not ripe and quality was very poor most of the fruit delivered was fruit easily obtainable at most grovery stores for a fraction of what was charged for this basket do not waste your money 
positive,23/5/20,i really satisfied with this product it does what it supposed to do in very effective way if your baby has digestion problems it is the natural and healthy way to solve it 
positive,22/11/20,this is very good quality foil i cannot find a difference between this recycled and virgin 
positive,30/3/20,just ordered my bag from this company wish the bag was not so flimsy i had to double bag it after opening but other than that excellent quality seeds and very prompt delivery 
positive,8/7/20,i bought this seed to make centerpieces for a safari themed baby shower i did a test run with one planter last week they sprouted beautifully and close to germination the grass is tall and healthy within only days 
positive,4/1/20,i ordered this as pumpkin seems to be in very short supply this year i was unable to find it at any of my three local grocery stores the quality of this is excellent 
negative,30/1/21,our pound dachshund absolutely loved this toy but in less than a week he had the face chewed off the eyes chewed off the tips of the ears chewed off and a hole in the tail plus had removed both squeekers i do not recommend this at all i am just going to keep buying the toys that last the same amount of time 
positive,2/11/20,they germinated seeds in an overall good condition i got around seedlings in about weeks i recommend this product
positive,17/10/20,i bought these for my brother in another state and accidentally had them shipped to me i am so glad that i did because then i had the opportunity to try them by the time i reordered some for him they were out of stock they are in stock now but will arrive after christmas great taste quality i have not found one bad one yet 
negative,22/7/19,i was looking forward to trying this bold coffee flavor which was supposed to have a sweet flavor however although package arrived earlier than promised the beans were old dull not glossy without evidence of oil on them which fresher beans would have lacked powerful smell if fresh would have been strong when opened consequently this coffee tasted poor watery after beans were ground and dripped 
positive,2/2/20,the tassimo machine with it is disc technology is an amazing product the convenience of being able to select so many different hot beverages in one machine is beneficial to our business our company uses the tassimo in our showroom so customers may enjoy the best quality beverage while browsing our displays thumbs up 
positive,4/10/20,this is a really good deal on some high quality chia seeds there really is not much more to say if you use chia seeds these are a great buy 
negative,1/4/20,i bought this as a gift for my husband and it was disappointing the quality of the chocolate is very poor closer to hershey kisses than dove or godiva the bacon flavor was off kind of bitter and more like bacon bits than actual bacon overall i wish i had not wasted on bars of sub par chocolate i know you want to try this for yourself because you think that everyone is being too picky that is what i thought too but do not save your money and make your own chocolate bacon bar at home 
positive,8/5/20,this is a great buy and the quality is great we add this to our coffee every day and have been very pleased with this yipee you do not have to pay supermarket prices 
positive,18/6/20,i like these they are short enough to be cute but stretch enough to cover everything vital they are very comfortable and stretchy not too tight they wash up nice without pilling and i have had no problem with the gold rear design peeling or coming off 
positive,20/8/20,this dried pineapple is of very good quality the pineapple pieces are of a good size and moist my year old daughter loves them and requests them for her school snack pack 
negative,1/6/21,sold by amazon the package arrived leaked with caps unsealed and easily opened when used the liquid ran out much faster than normal cannot believe amazon sold used products very unhappy 
positive,4/7/21,the beans came well packaged and in time we have never had a problem with these beans they have always been good in quality 
positive,5/2/20,i have been buying pig ears for my brother dogs for over ten years these were the best quality that i ever purchase they were bigger and the quality is just as good then what i purchase from other online stores 
positive,22/7/19,trophy nut these are excellent quality fresh cashews roasted dry not oily snack size packs are convenient for take along 
positive,2/2/20,these tahitian vanilla beans were just what i was looking for i was very glad that they were more or less the same size thickness however there were a couple in one of my orders and one bean in another that had some mould growing on them so i had to toss some that was the only downside they even arrived a little early too 
positive,22/11/20,my husband and i really enjoy this product we purchase it from a german baptist bulk foods store in town and have tried the black currant and the blueberry i was rather skeptical when my husband brought the bottle over to me to see what i thought but figured we would try it for the price we are not sorry as it is very quality flavor easy to mix and great for the price as you dilute it party syrup to parts water i actually use more water because we do not want it very sweet i would highly recommend this product 
positive,1/3/20,espresso pods are a no fuss no muss way to go i use the mypressi espresso maker which i love and pods make clean up a snap the lucaffe mixed case includes two skus i kind of wish there is been more but both are so tasty i cannot complain they also arrived loose in a box which was surprising for me but not a particular problem five stars because both my complaints are trivial and are irrelevant to the quality of the product 
positive,23/11/20,this is a high quality tea you can instantly tell the difference between this earl grey and the other more commons ones you find in the grocery store they are of such quality you can steep twice for two cups instead of one 
positive,5/4/21,very good product the increase did less to change my subscription i love this product and will continue buying in future 
positive,27/4/20,this was the second time i have ordered the bag from amazon both times i have gotten the freshest good plenty s i have ever gotten i get them at the store or at the movies and they are tough even hard i loved them and thought that is just how they came until i had them soft and chewy awesome 
positive,8/3/21,good looking good hand feeling stable with cold and hot water shift i got them within hours after i placed the order 
negative,30/1/20,soft and stale we ate a few when we opened the jug but we will throw the rest away 
negative,22/7/19,noamally get a different brand at costco which is far superior to keenan farms priced copetitively but not good quaity would not order again 
positive,2/2/20,i have found this product to be a good quality organic tea that you can drink everyday without breaking the bank i like to vary the types of tea i drink throughout the day so this one is just fine by my standards and enjoyable to drink 
negative,2/9/20,i placed my first order for this product in march of and i was very pleased with what i received i had never tried coconut milk before the coconut milk was thick and creamy if i did not shake the can before opening it there was a layer of very tasty cream at the top i finished my first case at the end of may and decided to sign up for amazon s subscription plan for roland coconut milk the new case arrived very quickly but the content of the cans was not the same this time the coconut milk was watery and had a flavor i was not fond of there was no layer of cream at the top of the can and it just sounded differently when i shook the can being of much thinner consistency both products were roland organic coconut milk i did notice some slight differences on the cans the thicker tasty non subscription cans were australian certified organic had a copyright and were a product of thailand the watery cans that came with the subscription had a klbd symbol on them were certified by control union certifications had a copyright and were a product of sri lanka both cans listed the same ingredients and nutrition information i should also note that i had no problem with the packaging of my first non subscription order there were very minor dents on about of the cans but nothing that made me consider throwing them away the packaging of the subscription order was a mess it was completely falling apart and a can fell out of the box when i picked it up i have not actually opened the box i have just slid the cans i have opened out of the holes in it the one can that fell out was dented but i think this was a result of the fall the other can was in good condition if i had reviewed this product after receiving my first order i would have given it five stars the lack of consistency in the product quality and the poor flavor of the order lead me to give this product a star review 
positive,26/1/21,i have been drinking lots and lots of tea over the past few months as i work through a low carb diet regime i had been buying varieties at the grocery store and decided it would be economical to simply buy a large sampler with that in mind i randomly chose bentley s finest tea classic collection i could not have been more pleased with the quality of the tea the peach tea is in fact my favorite in the collection but the english breakfast tea made me a fan of that flavor where i never had been before i will be watching for other tea collections from bentley s 
positive,9/1/21,we travel to va frequently i used to buy these there as favors for neighbors and then have the hassle of getting them back home now i just order from amazon to arrive on the day we get home the price is much less and no shipping hassles the quality is excellent i have tried the costco version and they are just not as good and nowhere near as good as planters or others 
negative,30/7/21,i bought keenan farms pistachios once earlier that batch appeared to alright this time around the product is not upto mark at all i have bought pistachios from local stores also which are far better and cheaper than this i have opened only one bag from the that i have received if any one from keenam farms is reading this i can return these to them so that they can see what is in the bags sent to me 
positive,30/10/20,these are quality hot stuffed peppers they are filled with tuna and anchovies and not bread crump fillers like almost all the other stuffed products the quality pepper as well as stuffing makes the product stand out and also explains the extra cost a healthy product with unsaturated vegetable fat respectfully submitted 
negative,3/8/20,the quality of this item is very poor my pound dog played with it a total of minutes before the seams fell apart would not recommend it i returned this item the next day 
positive,29/1/21,i got the sampler pack and was in general very happy with the coffees i generally prefer my coffee on the intense side no not burnt but with a lot of flavor so i found the corner donut shop to be too mild for my taste but cyclone was much more in line with my preferences the coffee was all really fresh for a k cup i found the ones marked extra bold to have the right amount of taste while the regulars were passable now that i have sampled the variety i am ready to move on to the specific blends that match my palate 
positive,24/10/21,expensive but so far is the best green tea i could find coconut green is my favorite flavor amazing i will definitely order more 
positive,24/10/21,the quality of these dates is fantastic however they need to be chopped smaller and more uniformly most people probably used chopped dates for recipies and i cannot imagine a recipe that would call for dates that are this coarsely chopped 
positive,16/10/21,this is by far the best chili seasoning mix i have found in years i especially like that there is no salt in the mix the rich chili flavor it produces is unequaled by anything i have found elsewhere it reminds me of the quality that was around when i was a child 
positive,24/10/21,securely stores every precious ounce of breast milk they are biodegradable easy to use because they are large and stand up sturdily i love these 
positive,25/9/21,these are wrapped neatly in bundles with ties around each bundle so you can select the amount you need after opening each package using boiling water with a small amount of oil these cook up rapidly it is necessary to cool these down with cold water after they have been drained to avoid sticking like most other noodles the noodles themselves are very tasty and make an authentic lo mein i recommend these and will order more when these are gone that may not be for a while though as these are packed in a case of packages just be sure you do not overcook them it only takes about minutes to boil them soft 
positive,19/10/21,the flavors in this product are absolutely fabulous naturally smoked lending a delicate natural flavor of smoke the only reason why i did not rate a star is that i find the little pellets do not dissolve well into cold dishes unlike the flaked style salts 
negative,20/10/21,hey the description says grams that is roughly ounces at under per can no way that is the approximate price for a gram can 
positive,19/10/21,these little buggers are tough to find so i was happy to get a big pack at a good price online my daughter is content with these as a reward for doing something well and at calories a piece not all that unhealthy 
positive,15/6/21,these are a cheap alternative for summer when everyone wants a cold treat superior flavor and size than the fla vor ice case 
negative,4/8/21,this coffee supposedly is premium it tastes watery very thin not good at all maybe old not sure it was a waste and i am using it line the bottom of my sitting shoes and trash cans and rained on luggage to absorb the smells so i used it but not to drink do not buy 
negative,4/8/21,found this product for sale on vacation in north carolina and loved it great maple flavor walmart sold it for for the pack wish i would have bought some more while i was there because i am not paying for what walmart can sell for that is just robbery very disappointed in zon for their insanely high price if price was reasonable would love to buy more and rate much higher 
positive,18/7/21,this product was everything and more according to the advertisement i was totally satisfied with my purchase i recommend to everyone to purchase these chips from this site 
positive,18/10/21,this is a delicious recipe and ingredients and the one i use a bit pricy but if you do not mind the price point it makes a wonderful waffle combine this with a waring waffle maker and you could be in waffle heaven 
positive,15/6/21,first time buyer of ka me rice crackers and i am very impressed these are very light crisp and flavorful they are as good plain as they are with cold cuts fruit etc unfortunately the ones i purchased may be the last i get from this source right after i purchased the dozen packs the price per dozen increased to its present fortunately i have enough to last a while but assuming the price stays the same these are my last ka me 
positive,4/8/21,i got tired of overpaying for tea at teavana so decided to try this brand of oolong tea and was pleasantly surprised it has a wonderful flavor and like the previous reviewer i just put the bag in a tea ball to compensate for the poor quality of the bags you just cannot beat the value of this tea 
positive,8/6/21,dop san marzano canned tomatoes are the finest canned tomatoes on the planet but i can get these for literally half the price at my local grocery store is this unusual boston is pretty heavily italian in some areas maybe that makes a difference i do not understand why anyone would buy them at this price check your local grocery store before you buy them at this price 
positive,15/6/21,i used these for my sons birthday party as one of the sweet treats to have out they are great the kids all loved them and the price was fabulous way better than purchasing elsewhere the item came as described and was fresh thank you amazon com
positive,4/8/21,yes these are wonderful and healthy cookies but this is a rare bad deal from amazon really dab nutrition they are charging about including shipping in less than a minute of web searching i found the same quantity for about shipped enjoy the cookies but buy from someone else until the price comes down 
positive,25/9/21,if you love green tea then you will be impressed with this green tea powder the instructions say to add one packet to ounces of cold water but i would recommend you try two packets and one packet oz of stevia the flavor of the tea with only one packet is fairly mild so mild in fact that you can barely taste the green tea flavor when you order this tea you will get six boxes with packets in each if you use two packets per bottle of water you get drinks that is only cents per drink if you get free shipping i ordered some books too i think that is fairly reasonable i look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices a website is given for additional recipes there are a few interesting recipes like the ones for white chocolate green tea ice cream green tea papaya nectar and green tea sugar cookies you will probably find many uses for this and i have even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea just use one packet per ounces of hot water no brewing required this tea dissolves very easily in hot or ice cold water i can highly recommend it to you the rebecca review
negative,19/10/21,we loved this popcorn but come on shipping is way over the top we would settle next time for something we can buy but not spend times on shipping
positive,4/9/21,i have tried a handful of other brands of french roast and i find this one and tully s version to be both great and comparable in flavor the difference is the price this one is far more reasonable 
positive,31/8/21,these are great spices to use on all food types giving a great flavor the bottle sizes are twice the size of that found in a supermarket and about the same price so you get more of what you would normally pay for 
positive,9/10/21,great option for excellent taste price and convenience a repeat customer on these we order these now in the pack instead of getting at the grocery store 
positive,15/6/21,i like to brew a k cup cocoa into my coffee for a nice mocha this dark chocolate flavor is quite nice especially mixed with double black diamond coffee though not the very best it is good and the price is right compared to other brands 
positive,4/8/21,my kids have been begging for hot cocoa k cups and when i found these so reasonably priced i decided to give them a try we all loved them 
positive,15/6/21,we purchase this food for our two boxers and great dane the dane has an allergy to chicken and one of the boxers has a weak stomach so this food is perfect for them all three dogs love it even the picky one and it seems to agree with their digestive tracts more than any other dog food that we have tried i cannot begin to tell you how pleased i am about that i did a lot of research to find a quality food that is not full of filler and will not break the bank i am pleased with this food more so than any of the other more expensive brands that i have tried 
positive,4/8/21,it is amazing how little popularity that diamond pet foods seems to have considering the quality ingredients their foods contain i worked at a pet store for about four years our number one recommendations on foods were natural balance and wellness two exceptional foods that are pretty expensive but for those owners who have multiple dogs or even one large breed dog those brands can cripple your budget so when i would get customers who absolutely loved their pets and wanted to be able to feed them healthy food without breaking their banks i recommended diamond diamond dog food costs about the same as those commercial brands like purina and iams but contains only natural healthy ingredients just remember the less garbage you feed your dog by products fillers the less your dog uses the bathroom and they stay fuller longer 
positive,15/6/21,great for stocking up and keeping a few in the closet i like to buy things in bulk and this was a good deal and smells good too 
positive,4/8/21,these arrived fresh and in very good shape just like buying from the local store only cheaper and delivered to my door 
positive,1/10/21, years ago i bought a digidesign protools rack and a lot of other equipment to start recording but i could never get it to work with my os on either computer i was at an impasse for a long time until i saw this product on blue s website i already had a condenser mic in the closet i had never gotten to use and did not want to spend more money on a quality usb mic i could not be happy that this product exists in it is quality or price i noticed no noise or coloration of the signal and it worked without a problem it does exactly what it is suppose to do act like it does not exist it just serves it purpose to convert the signal well and stays out of the way on everything else it does feel light weight and the signal was a little lower than i thought as many reviews said and that is the only reason i did not give it stars but i do not think that should keep anyone from getting this product 
positive,1/7/18,i have a keurig coffee maker you know the one with the k cups to have a coffee like this you have to have a special filter which i do have honestly you will spend a crapload of money on k cups if you do not get the filter for regular ground coffee anyway i do not know if it was because the coffee was ground or filtered a special way but the water in my keurig had a hard time seeping through causing a bit of an overflow aside from that the taste was smooth and flavorful it has a coffee taste plain and simple is it anything special not really it just tastes good and is reasonably priced 
positive,10/8/18,i have used this bbq sauce before and it is good especially considering that is free of so many negatives like corn syrup and for us gluten but the price on this cannot be right order directly from the daddy sam s website to pay oz bottle this price would have to be a case price although the description says 
positive,1/7/18, year old elkhound loves this food and it keeps her in great health amazon has the best price i have found for this food and it is even better with subscribe and save i highly recommend it 
negative,10/8/18,i absolutely love this stuff but i pay to for a pack in the grocery store why is this price so high 
positive,13/9/18,i am no coffee snob but this is still much better than crap you get a starbucks i drink black coffee so flavor really matters when its not covered by caramel and other junk great coffee for a great price especially if you get it when amazon is offering the off coupon 
positive,17/7/18,not the best coffee but it is not bad as well we bought more after we tried the first time because for the price we have got it is fine godiva is still our favorite but this one is okay too 
positive,16/1/19,i was a little worried about the other reviews that said their wrappers were broken i wonder if they were pushing the wrappers they suggested both suggested the same wrappers hmmm however the wrappers arrived intact in fact we took two packages camping and the left overs made it home without damage i detected no difference from the rice wrappers we buy locally at an asian market buying in bulk saved lots of there were a couple of wrappers out of dozens that had a few tiny air bubble holes in them it did not affect the taste or function that is the reason for stars instead of we were not wrapping anything that was really drippy so it was not a problem we will definitely order again shipping was rapid a great buying experience 
negative,16/1/18,go to costco and you can buy lower than this price per oz currently off regular tax for big size oz besides it is more convinient to return if you kid does not like this formula be careful many times some sellers over price a product and still make the product rank in the best sellers 
positive,16/1/19,these are guaranteed to be a hit with my kids like regular gummy bears but even better with extra flavor perfect consistency not too chewy great all the way around 
positive,1/8/20,excellent we have enjoyed yuban coffee for many years we recently tried the dark roast coffee and would recommend it if you want a rich tasting coffee smooth with no bitterness beats the high price of many gourmet coffees without sacrificing that delicious flavor that coffee lovers look for 
positive,1/7/18,there is nothing wrong with this product but it is overpriced with a little research you can buy this for less than half the price buyer beware
positive,10/8/18,tried this because it is kona and much cheaper than the other national brands i have been using what can i say i am greatly surprised mild no bite too it and no discernable acidity this is on my shopping list from now on 
positive,15/2/20,my daughter loves these dinners there is no other organic meat option at my grocery store so we are stuck with this one but i do not mind at all i think they are great i agree that they are runny but you can just thicken it with whole grain cereal and problem solved turkey dinner is thick enough i also do not understand why people complain that they are too sweet or unhealthy first of all if you do not like the ingredients buy something else second i trust earth s best enough to believe they know the right amount of stuff to put in their product third the belief that if baby tastes sweet food they will not eat regular food is an old wife s tale are you people saying that you do not give your babies fruit and vegetables they are all sweet the only reason i gave this particular item stars instead of five is the price i can buy it at my grocery store for cents a jar here they are being sold for over cents and that is at the sale price if you buy these at the regular price it comes to way too much 
positive,22/4/21,i purchased this food on amazon then saw it at babies r us for cents less per jar i like the product but amazon is overcharging 
positive,25/9/20,with the amazon mom discount this is cheaper than in stores unless there is a sale it regularly goes on sale at kroger publix and other grocery stores for around cents a jar i wish there were other earth s best fruit varieties available on amazon at this price no problems with breakage during shipping for me but i found the packaging annoying in general though i think earth s best is a good brand and that the price is fair for what you are getting organic non gmo baby food delivered to your door step as a single mom in a rural community going to the grocery store with the baby can be such a hassle earth s best is definitely better tasting and smelling than non organic foods like gerber the textures are good but i had to stay on foods longer than six months because the textures of almost all foods made my son gag i had a similar issue graduating from foods to foods sprout baby food however is the best quality i have tried for freshness aroma and taste it reminds me of pureed fresh produce while i have seen it in winn dixie for the same price as earth s best it is much more expensive on amazon and the selection of flavors is relatively limited both in stores and online i am going to start making my own organic baby food and freezing it but i will probably always keep a few jars of earth s best to get by in a pinch 
positive,16/11/19,i was very pleased with the price of this product and the shipping speed was fast i like that i did not have to lug this back from the grocery store thanks amazon 
positive,9/9/20,i bought this for my year old and he loves it just as much as the other organic brands we have purchased but i got this one for less great buy 
negative,1/7/18,beware of what you are being charged it says that it is but is charing you plus in shipping i have found this to be true for several other items on this site i am not sure if this is a misprint amazon does not seem to think it is an issue since the seller can charge whatever they want for the item i disagree and think it is amazon s responisbility to get to the bottom of this 
negative,10/8/18,this food is phenomenal but way overpriced i pay a case in new york city and it is often on sale for less than a case at babiesrus in new york city grocery prices are obscene in ny so if i am paying less here this is no deal 
positive,15/1/20,we have been looking for pesto that tastes as good as what we had in tuscany this is from the same region as our favorite the consistency is just a bit runny it has moderate chunks of garlic it was quite tasty 
positive,1/9/20,yuban is one of the best coffees available but not sold in all areas amazon s case price is unbeatable i get a case every weeks always on time 
positive,22/7/21,i am constantly trying to find vanilla beans at a reasonable price often when i do they are hard as rocks dry and practically unusable i was so frustrated at safeway where one bean was dry and hard as a rock the best i have found was at trader joe s where i could get three beans for they were decent this price was so reasonable that i worried they were not going to be fresh good etc i was wrong the beans were incredibly fresh and supple i am using them to make vanilla extract and they have worked perfectly they keep well in the fridge so i am using them in everything the price is great but there might be too many to use if that is the case then split them with a friend then it becomes one of the best culinary deals ever absolutely wonderful i will buy these again and again 
positive,1/7/18,i received these wonderful beans today through amazon i have not opened the vacuum sealed bag yet but the fragrance is divine they are about inches long and plump and soft it looks like there are maybe beans 
positive,10/8/18,i got these weeks ago for the price i was not expecting much but they are really fresh and fragrant i have used them to make bavarian cream and creme brulee and they taste great 
positive,14/5/21,this is the buy of a lifetime for about beans instead of for and the flavor was great made ice cream that everyone raved about i vacuum sealed portions for future use to keep them as fresh as possible 
positive,17/10/19,my boston terriers love these treats they are natural wholesome and soft enough to break into multiple pieces we keep a steady supply of them in the house i order at least containers at a time since we do not want to run out amazon s seller all pets has the best price around 
positive,3/10/21,i started loving oolong tea after i discovered a bottled product called tejava that product is over a dollar for a ounce bottle i needed something less expensive so i tried this prince of peace brand oolong after a few brewing experiments i now love this stuff what i have learned if brewing as sun tea this type of tea seems to come out very weak if you put this tea in boiling water it may come out bitter i now heat up my water in a microwave until it is very hot to the touch but no way near boiling i then put in the tea bags and let it brew for about twenty minutes i like strong tea i have to my taste duplicated the tejava brew at a fraction of the original cost enjoy ken
positive,15/9/20,great product and priced well we have ordered this several times over the past few years and really like their walnut oil packaged well and ships on time will keep ordering this product from the same seller
positive,30/8/20,i love the walnut oil it came in cans which i like a lot because you hardly see them any more the walnut oil was better quality than any of the walnut oil i bought in my neighbourhood and cheaper even with the shipping charge i recommend it to anyone 
positive,1/7/18,one of my favorite salad recipes i make often calls for walnut oil i bought a small bottle from a local major grocery store and it was over for about ounces steep i love walnuts so naturally i loved this oil from my very first taste but the price was not right so i searched on the internet and found this i was a little reluctant to buy cans as i thought they go rancid before i can finish but i am now on my last can i use it in place of evoo to make other vinaigrettes too or just splash this walnut oil and my favorite raspberry vinegar and b s or seasons salt like krazy salt over spring mix it is an easy but great green salad i do this a lot when i need a quick side anyway this oil goes well with anything and it does not taste too nutty just a touch of nice walnut flavor of course i love walnuts so even if it tastes very walnutty i would still like it anyway it is a great product and i will buy the same pack again 
negative,10/8/18,i bought these for my wife for her birthday she loves chocolate and its a staple gift i give her well this year i got her these she only ate one and put them away very strange later i caught her putting them in the garbage when i tried one i quickly realized why they taste like they have no sugar in them and leave an aftertaste that reminded me of badly burnt toast i had to brush my teeth to get the taste out we had a good laugh about it fortunately i also gave her a necklace which she really did love so they did not ruin her birthday dollars wasted 
negative,5/12/19,the advertised regular price of is ridiculous hour energy drinks are widely available for each do not buy from sellers who inflate prices and charge ridiculous amounts you can get a case of for right here on amazon 
positive,21/10/19,trying something new with this coffee did not blow me away but for the price it is excellent i do not have anything bad to say about it other than it is a big bag and i am mildly concerned with freshness toward the end but we burn thru beans pretty fast d
positive,8/9/20,tea s are very personal and everyone has their favorites i really enjoy this tea when relaxing or before bed the subtle mint flavor seems to comfort and sooth a little sugar i am not a fan of honey really makes all the flavors pop being a fan of this tea it was a no brainer to order it in bulk the price at the time was great cheaper then the grocery store by far the packaging was efficient and made it really easy to store 
negative,22/9/21,i love all different types of beef jerky but not this one it has the flavor of grocery store bought beef jerky once you get over the overwhelming taste of salt these sticks are cut thin making them tender and easy to chew but they are just way too salty and definitely not worth 
positive,2/10/20,this squeezy fruit as my daughter calls it is great convenient yummy no added sugar i love it i just do not understand why it is so expensive i find it at the grocery store for for a four pack do not pay this price that is crazy 
negative,25/7/20,skittles are a great candy but for this product i would say do not buy it here i have seen this same bag for on sale and not on sale for at some big chain stores the candies themselves are fine and if you are thinking of getting a big bag you know what they taste like just do not overspend to get a big bag price wise might be cheaper to buy a bunch of little bags 
negative,4/7/21,i have enjoyed this product for quite some time however i am disgusted by the fact that the price keeps increasing at per case customers are paying more than per box for small cookie bars ridiculous i will find a healthier more reasonably priced snack to munch on shame on nana and amazon 
negative,11/9/21,i decided to give these a try the lids are very difficult to put on and i often ended up bending the cup while trying to affix the lid they do not seal perfectly and i often found unexpected puddles but they do the job since i have a keurig permanant filter i thought of just buying the paper filters to save on cleanup for almost from this vendor you can get fifty paper filters i would just assume use paper towels that works out to be just under cents for a small piece of paper disposakups please re evaluate your pricing 
positive,4/7/21,amazon has the best price in town hot nuts that do not disappoint i would recommend trying dave s other items as well great flavor 
positive,21/9/21,this is one of the best hot dogs made unfortunatally it is not widely available citymade must be off their rocker if they think people are going to sale hot dogs for such a crazy price granted there is weiners in a package still a stupid price 
positive,11/9/21,the stuff is great but i will pay at most or for four bottles 
positive,12/10/21,these raw shelled pumpkin seed kernels actually have a slight pumpkin flavor which i assume indicates that they are fresh unlike the store bought h e b raw kernels that were pretty bland they are also extremely nutritious high in iron protein and fiber actually pumpkin seed kernels have four times the iron and about more protein than beef per gram the price produces somewhat of a sticker shock though at over seven bucks per pound however considering all of the fiber and nutrients i believe they are well worth the price bob s red mill has the nutrition facts displayed on his web site i highly recommend these pumpkin kernels because they taste great and as you can from the facts below are at the top of the nutrition chart usda nutrition content seeds pumpkin and squash seed kernels dried protein fiber total dietary folate food niacin vitamin b riboflavin thiamin vitamin c total ascorbic acid vitamin a rae vitamin e alpha tocopherol calcium ca iron fe phosphorus p magnesium mg copper cu selenium se zinc zn 
positive,11/10/21,i gave this item as a gift and the recipient has not yet made the dish for which i gave it to her a foie gras dish but i must say this price for a french truffle is amazing i suspect most of us do not have the palates to appreciate the truffles good for those of you who do but for the rest of us this is a good choice linda morse
positive,28/9/21,always used the robertsons ginger this production is almost as good but the price is inflated for the size of the jar the product was packed well glass jars and arrived promptly 
negative,19/10/21,you can order the same products online from nespresso for approx and you can specify exactly what you want to buy rather than taking a mixture of items some of which you may not like nespresso makes great coffee and great machines the nespresso capsule offers posted on amazon however are all by third parties who prey on people who do not know better 
positive,4/7/21,my border collies expect one of these each night before bed i have learned how important it is to create regular routines to keep these active wired dogs calm and there is no way i have time to brush their teeth each nite even if they would let me but this can get very expensive when i found them here at this price i ordered tons then went back and ordered more figuring the price would increase to that on other sites it had increased a bit but still a great price entirely pets delivered a bit late due to supply problems but that was okay since i had just received enough to last a month 
positive,11/9/21,i have always been a fan of annie s products and since i am overseas at the moment i didn have access to the products that is where amazon comes in the price is very good almost the same as buying them in the store in the states and the product came in great shape and the expiration date is not soon either as for the product itself i think the sauce can use less salt but other wise i love it natural ingredients and it takes less than minutes for me to make it 
positive,12/9/21,this is a great price for powdered goat milk at the local health food store the only place in town that carries goat milk i buy just one of these cans for for three cans is the best price i have found i use goat milk for my children when they are in the process of weaning and as long as they want it it is so much healthier than formula because well it is not soy or dairy based and has no chemicals and added vitamins that try to mimic breastmilk goat milk is more similar to breastmilk than dairy so is much easier for humans to digest than cow milk i find it to be a great alternative for babies as they adjust or for those who cannot tolerate dairy for warm bottles for my month old i just heat water on the stove then pour it into her glass bottle with a scoop of goat milk shake it up and she has her favorite drink other than momma s milk of course 
positive,13/7/21,this is a great deal for the amount of pretzel packs that are given we love these since they are only calories each and perfect for a snack pair with a sandwich or just to stick in your purse if you get hungry 
negative,23/10/21,i can get this at my local grocery store for per can for 
positive,22/9/21,i got this product for consumption i took some of the store bought baking soda and did not know it is loaded with aluminum so glad i was able to find this product thru amazon and after reading all the positive reviews i got it and started taking some with a glass of water great product fast delivery great price very happy with my purchase 
positive,4/7/21,i have drunk whole bean tanzanian peaberry for about years my first source was the large national retailer and wholesaler green mountain which roasted their tanzanian peaberry light to medium although the beans made good coffee green mountain s price eventually became higher than i thought reasonable an internet seach led me to a small family owned and family operated roaster in tennessee their beans were also light to medium and thus had a dry appearance that level of roasting was to my liking because the beans retain more caffeine and the natural flavor of the coffee is more apparent than with darker roasts when the tennessee roaster s computer system crashed and online sales were temporarily suspended i did another internet search and found amazon s tanzanian peaberry roasted by coffee bean direct it has essentially the same good taste as the tanzanian peaberry from the tennessee roaster and the price is lower i am totally satisfied with the beans roasted by coffee bean direct and the shipping by amazon is quick enough that buying three pounds at a time allows me to place my next order before the current one runs out 
positive,11/9/21,these individually packed milk is great for on the road does not need to be stored in the frig this item came in packs of then shipped in its original box and then another amazon box over it the content was securely packed and i was not worried that the milk got dirty during shipping the price is the same as in local grocery store but shipping to the house saved me from dragging them from the store while my toddler is jumping up and down the store aisle the only reason that i did not give it stars is because of the expiration date it is mar which is not too far away i just bought one from target because i forgot to bring one and my toddler was restless and it has an expiration date of sept overall i would still recommend to buy from amazon 
positive,8/8/21,i am new to tofu newly vegan and was dismayed at the price of tofu in local health food stores and the scarcity of it in regular grocery stores i was hesitant to purchase in bulk but am so glad i did i purchased both the soft and the firm versions and it has been great in every recipe i will definitely be ordering again 
negative,9/7/21,i love these crackers but not the price change at for boxes a box if you sign up for subscribe and save i was ecstatic i most definitely signed up for subscribe and save delivery not yet months later i learn the identical item now cost for boxes bait and switch i think these crackers taste better than their clone parent the triscuit boxes is just right for a two month period i keep a couple boxes at work use them for bringing nibblies to gatherings and more importantly as a stable of my diet because i choose not to eat bread and i love food items with ingredient lists like this whole wheat expeller pressed oleic safflower oil sea salt natural tocopherols added to preserve freshness as a big city dweller who uses public trans i do not own a car i rely on amazon for certain essential groceries i pick them up at the ups store on my walk home from the train stop it is one of the main reasons i am a prime member i will need to cancel my subscribe and save for this item i like to think amazon was not going to send the next delivery without notifying me of the new price i can get triscuits anywhere for a box sometimes less the back to nature cracker is now a box it is likely the pricing situation is out of their hands but i am so disappointed looks like i will be checking out the cracker selection at costco 
negative,24/10/21,i used to order this product at per box of cans and now it turned into dollars how did it double out of nowhere 
positive,4/7/21,i buy these with subscribe and save i like the flavor and aroma going on month two and i am not tired of them yet 
positive,11/9/21,i do like this coffee but even with subscribe and save amazon s price is higher than k cups at bed bath beyond convenience is one thing but since there are bb bs all around me it is pretty easy to pick up my coffee there and save a few bucks i wish amazon would price their coffees more competitively i would buy here exclusively if they did but this is good medium roast coffee not quite as strong as i would like but a little stronger than the breakfast in bed version i may need to try sorrento and see if it is a little bolder 
positive,24/10/21,a nutritionist recommended these to sweeten my coffee etc as there are no negative after effects unlike artificial sweeteners stevia is made from herb in south america japanese tea drinkers have been using stevia for years with no ill effects she said it is quite a bit sweeter than sugar so you need less of it as a replacement i like this brand and put two packets in my iced coffee every morning with almond milk and t cocoa it tastes like a coffee milk shake for only about calories as the stevia is calorie free the stevia makes it taste like an iced dessert drink and is a great refreshing treat for the day this multi pack offer for this price is about lower than what i can get nustevia for locally 
negative,22/6/21,when i bought this food i saw the image and price and assumed that i would be paying a fair price less per bag than the grocery store for low grade cat food the image and price combination led me to think that i would be paying for bags a good deal when i received six bags i thought there had been a mistake nope so i spend returning it i bought three packs oops and now ozbo customer service tells me they take weeks processing returns my kitties need food now and these people want to sit on my for that long do not buy from these scammers 
negative,30/7/21,this is a good product especially for iced coffee but why is it twice the price as it is in stores this is not a fluke within the past two months i have bought it for a jar in seattle and in nevada so it just looks like good old fashioned gouging try harder amazon 
positive,10/7/21,i am very fond of this coffee and i will not accept substitutes for it several of my local stores have substituted another brand i just order it on line when i cannot get it in a store however amazon s price is too high it is a jar in local stores 
positive,4/7/21,is this price for a single ounce jar or for a pack the description only indicates that the price is for ounces which of course is ridiculously expensive but it is a good deal if it is for a pack previous buyers can you please advise the coffee itself is excellent i usually buy it in the store and was hoping to find a deal on amazon 
positive,11/9/21,this is a great product but for really you can get it from other sellers or at the grocery store for show this price gouger what the market will really bear 
positive,20/9/21,so far this has been a great way to order my favorite coffee it has become really hard to find it at the local stores but amazon had it even cheaper than i previously paid for it it arrived very quickly and i am waiting any day now for the next shipment 
positive,13/10/21,this food looks just like something you would make for your pet at a thanksgiving day dinner i was impressed with it when i opened the can and my cats were when they ate it it contains nice size pieces of shredded turkey not too big making it easy for my kitties to eat they have gotten the tiki cat chicken before and the long stringy pieces in that kept them busy for a little bit and they seemed kind of tough even for me when i would try to break them up not this i just spooned it into their bowls and they took over from there there is liquid around the sides of the food in the center but the meat vege mix in the middle is well packed i did not feel like i was getting more liquid than food like halo foods so i was happy about that as well plus through amazon this is a great price for this quality food 
positive,2/8/21,i have tried several brands and this is true to the taste of fresh coconut water though slightly more dilute the wholesale price here does not make much sense to me it is about per liter in an pack i get it for at publix the only disadvantage is that they only have maybe or at a time but i am one of few buying it and i sweep the shelves of it lol i am weeks pregnant and this helps decrease the swelling in my legs and keeps me well hydrated i do not experience any leg cramps like i did during my first pregnancy i think the potassium makes a huge difference and with a tendency towards gestational diabetes the low sugar content vs other sports drinks is a huge advantage they should market this directly to pregnant women with diabetes with no renal issues 
positive,11/6/21,i get these for at my local health food store their price sucks it is one of the best tasting coconut waters around though 
positive,2/8/21,if you want kopi luwak this is a good method to acquire some in a relatively cheap manner it is not as good as some of the stuff i have had but it is definitely in that special class that kopi luwak belongs in i have served this for guest given it as gifts and enjoyed it on special occasions i have made it in french press drip and in one special instance espresso to truly enjoy it use about grams of beans per ounces of hot water used to brew this is the appropriate ratios serve black no cream or sugar as this will ruin your treat this bean is not for everyone but do not worry it is not an acquired taste its just a different taste product arrived fast thank to prime fresh as i wanted and the beans tasted just like they do when i buy them locally from rao s bakery here in tx same beans same company 
positive,18/10/21,this has become our new coffee of choice for the mornings it is a good price for a solid cup of organic coffee beans are medium roast and very fragrant 
positive,23/7/21,i am not much on stuff like this but having some issued that i think this item will take care of i got some here local shops did not carry it prices at flea markets and food shops were just to high the price from amazon was very good i no longer have need of this item but if the condition returns so will i here 
negative,8/7/21,i bought this product not that many months ago and loved it but no longer buying this brand because it doubled in price i bought it for originally will buy another brand 
positive,11/6/21,these may last forever at every day in my morning shake since i am having trouble finding recipes for other ways to use these seeds but they will keep in a sealed plastic container 
negative,25/6/21,this is a great product my baby loves it i especially like the smooth liquid formula versus the powder since the powder never seems to dissolve properly i am however rating this low because of the seller is ridiculous this product normally sells for but they are jacking up the price because there is a shortage of the liquid formula due to the powder recall you should be ashamed amazon this is food for a baby makes me ill 
positive,2/8/21,kind of expensive for cheese product would expect ssomething closer to the per pound price i can get in the supermarket but it is so versatile can be used in any recipe that calls for cheese my favorite use is to super cheese both store brand and even kraft boxed mac n cheese sometimes that little packet of cheese powder just does not give me the cheese i ness i want so after mixing the mac n cheese according to the directions on the box i put a few slices of velveeta on top nuke it for a few minutes mix it in and viola try it you will never want to eat mac n cheese out of the box again 
negative,11/6/21,i spent close to for each cube which turned out to be the size i know it says that upon further review but i was assuming it was the size because that size is at the grocery and i just paid the same thing for the size shame on you amazon or better yet shame on me the expiration date is fast approaching too so i am not even sure i will use these up in a month i was very disappointed in the price as well as the expiration date i had the same issue with some sunflower seeds i bought recently they expired before baseball season even started however i did get what i paid for it is just my mistake for not realizing the size was not what i thought i was getting who would pay that for the size 
positive,9/7/21,costco stopped carrying this near me so when i found out it was on amazon for cheaper i was so excited it came pretty quick was at an unbeatable price and was the same good hot cereal i got from the costco no damage or anything 
positive,22/6/21,i have purchased green coffee beans from several local and internet providers often with poor results you roast them is the exception i have never had bad service with this company and now purchase all of my coffee from them they provide an excellent selection of high quality beans at great prices they do a great job with packaging and shipping most of my orders have shipped the same day i ordered i have tried most of their coffees and have yet to be disappointed if you are looking for a good mid priced coffee i would recommend la minita tarrazu de costa rica i highly recommend you check out you roast them for all your coffee needs 
positive,2/8/21,nutiva organic hemp seeds are so good for you they are protein omega and gla i think the msrp on these bags is each so amazon has these priced at almost half price this is a great affordable way to get some healthy proteins and fats amazon sent me very fresh product i subscribed n saved on july and it arrived via ontrac on july the nutiva hempseed package says it was packed on may and is best before may pretty fresh product and tastes fresh too sprinkle on top of your cereal omelets yogurt soups salads and veggies hemp seeds require no advance soaking to derive optimal nutritional benefit here is a great way to enjoy hemp hemp seeds cup spring water maple syrup honey stevia or your favorite sweetneer dash himalyan salt optional flavoriing cinnamon nutmeg vanilla cardamom combine all in a blender and blend well until a creamy white milk forms pour through a strainer to remove any husk residue will keep in refrigerator for days but i recommend preparing small batches right when you want to drink them as fresh is the most tasty and most nutritious you could also make a great milk out of cinnamon red maca almond butter 
positive,11/6/21,i love this gravy mix much easier and less fat than making from scratch and not as salty as mccormick s or other brands i use non fat milk instead of water to make a cream gravy this is good stuff and by time you order this set of and other items there is no shipping and no tax the price is much less than i could get when on sale at my local supermarket 
negative,8/7/21,very disappointed in this heed the bad reviews i am now at the lowest amount of brewing and it still tastes watered down need to dump some swiss miss hot chocolate in there to give it flavor and that point what was the purpose with the product already being overpriced shop elsewhere as it was and tasting watered down it just was not worth it skip it maybe a different brand will be better 
positive,28/9/21,i love this stuff there is not an instant coffee out there that is anywhere near this good this is not even in the same category as any other instant it actually tastes like real coffee shocking but true it is no lie almost as good as freshly brewed starbucks it is also great for iced coffee and for adding to smoothies and other recipes that call for a coffee kick however the stuff is so darned expensive that i feel foolish buying it unfortunately it has to be a special splurge when my budget allows 
positive,23/8/21,compared to what i pay at the normal grocery store for almonds these are priced great and taste fresh and crunchy the sea salt taste is perfect and the containers are conviently sized 
negative,1/8/21,during my recent visit to new orleans in june of i fell in love with etouffee sauce on redfish oh my goodness delicious i picked up a few packages of the louisiana cajun etouffee mix for per package and made it at home it was fantastic i ordered the product on amazon from a particular seller and for the price of more than dollars was delivered one package the product description on the website did not clarify the number of packages to be delivered for this amount i assumed three packages for that price i received one package and returned it to them immediately you can purchase this product on line from the retailer for less than two dollars per package with free shipping so avoid purchasing this via this seller great product however 
positive,16/7/21,this is a must have in my home i use olive oil for everything my skin hair cooking taking off makeup this is great quality organic virgin olive oil and i am in heaven 
positive,2/8/21,i made prunes a permanent part of my diet because a they are promoted as the best food source of antioxidants and b because they are very sweet and serve as a good sugar substitute for when you have sugar cravings they are also supposed to be good um um against constipation so be careful i usually eat a couple at a time and never more than four never a problem within these limits they are nice to add to oatmeal too along with bananas and raisins or instead of raisins raisins are also a good antioxidant in fact second best after prunes about half as strong i have tried many kinds of prunes and so far sunsweet are the best i like their taste best consistency is good neither too mushy nor dried up like cardboard they keep up well i do keep thim in the fridge but that is strictlyl speaking unnecessary they will be fine for a couple of weeks in the open and they taste better at room temperature and the product quality is consistent no surprises i buy them in stores where an oz canister usually costs between four and five bucks this page wants thirty well this must be some sort of error i expect an online price to be better not six to seven times what i can get locally so my bottomline is this sort of prunes is very good but pick them up at your local grocery store not here in fact i got them a few times on sale for like two seventy a piece in a local drugstore believe it or not be very careful with prices here first they jump around quite a bit and second if you subscribe and the price goes up they will just go ahead and charge you more w o bothering to ask you if you agree to pay more avoid subscriptions because yeah they will give you an extra discount and next month will jack up the price by it is a racket so stay clear ps just discovered trader joe s carries pitted prunes too a resealable plastic bag holds one pound oz and costs two eighty nine that is about one tenth of what this guy above wants bemuzing to say the least 
positive,11/6/21,i will certainly be a repeat customer i had a tough time finding large salt crystals to refill a grinder but this fit the bill nicely flavor is clean with slight minerality the color is not a deep as some other himalayan pink i have seen but it is a very good finishing salt and a good conversation piece when put on the table in a clear grinder also the seller included a coupon for a future purchase in the package which was a nice bonus 
positive,26/6/21,i got this at a great price i paid without subscribe and save for boxes that contain separate bags so you see is a whole bunch of cookies i am abroad but i hear that my stepson s reaction was wow they will all be gone tomorrow teenager resembles a bottomless pit but it was a very good price cookies are fresh and packaging as appropriate will buy again by the way i just saw that the price on this was my favorite things llc refresh a couple of times till you see fulfilled by amazon com 
negative,20/8/21,item appears to be keurig brand by title description big however upon receiving it it is an off brand my perfect kitchen sold at bed bath beyond and at half the price i was disappointed in the jading and sent it back signed up for bbb email promos and got a off coupon for use in the store so i bought this exact item for reg only in store i mean exact do your homework and save yourself some money oh and the item itself is great we have the larger platinum and it does have an issue with the cupboards but i just pulled it forward about and it is perfect i am fortunate enough to have a lot of counter space and i may move it to an open top area so for us it is all good 
positive,25/8/21,this product is well worth the money others carry a similar product that is cheaper but the quality is way cheaper also 
positive,19/10/21,i bought this one until i saw one exactly like it at a big box store think red bullseye for this is going back

positive,22/10/21,my jack russell has problems with patella luxation i decided against surgery after researching the success rate of it and years after it was diagnosed she is still ok i keep her weight down and give her plenty of long walks to stengthen her ligaments the vet told me she would probably have problems with arthritis so i give her one of these chicken strips daily and also give her liquid glucosamine choindroitin on a small piece of bread my dog loves the chicken strips the price on amazon is better than me buying the indivdual packs from the store and having the glucosamine in it is another way for me to administer glucosamine to her in a way that is tasty 
positive,6/8/21,i bought this for cooking from whipping egg whites to making my own baking powder this cream of tartar is great i put some in a small jar in my cupboard for everyday use the remainder i keep sealed tightly in the freezer it will last quite a long time and buying it this way is exponentially less expensive than buying the small over priced jars in the grocery market 
positive,24/6/21,i got the same product at my local grocery store for much cheaper what is going on amazon you are not even offering a bulk price great product my dogs love them too but can be found much cheaper elsewhere 
positive,17/4/21,i purchased the same bag from the vet for when my dog was diagnosed with addison s disease i concludeded that i would need to use the pill pockets for the rest of his life not only do they work he would not take the prednisone in cheese or other foods but you do not need to use the entire pill each time i just break away enough so that it covers his pill and he loves it great product at a great price 
positive,10/3/21,the price for these k cups is great they are so costly in the store so this is a great way to buy in bulk 
negative,17/4/21,quality is ok but if you need maltodextring in larger but not huge quantities buy carbo gain from now foods much better bang for the buck

positive,30/1/21,very reasonable price for an outstanding product checked many other retailers locally and online i can honestly say without a doubt that i received the best value for the pack coconut bars 
positive,13/2/21,this is the best price i have found for and it is eligible for free shipping and handling it tastes better than another powdered peanut butter product that i have tried

positive,14/1/21,my two dogs adore greenies this seemed to be the best place price i found online very quickly shipped too 
positive,24/5/21,i like to buy greenies for my dog but they are very expensive even in multi packs if you purchase at online pet stores they are somewhat less expensive but not like the boxes offered on amazon dogs need clean teeth and healthy gums and greenies will take care of both easily digestible for my year old shi tzu 
positive,14/10/21,buying the greenies online is the way to go they cost about cheaper than if you were to walk into a chain pet store 
positive,7/2/21,i found this site to have the best price for the quantities on the web i would definitely order from here again

negative,20/8/21,i cannot believe anyone is buying this stuff at amazon go to keurig com and pay half of this price spread the word because this is rediculous 
positive,14/8/21,amazon has a hell of a nerve charging for a case of happy bellies cereal when anywhere else it is each can 
negative,21/4/21,they are charging per k cup i saw this and decided to go to keurig com and these same k cups are half price
negative,1/4/21,product is ok but i consider it very expensive for a small plastic item if i had seen the product in person i never would have paid that much for it 
negative,17/4/21,i really like this coffee but i will be dammed if i am going to pay cents a cup just to support gm s stock price i hope whatever they are smoking over in corporate is worth it

positive,25/4/21,since there is a national shortage of canned pumpkin i was very happy to find an online source for this product our dog needs the pumpkin to keep her digestive tract regular and she loves it this is a great product at a great price 
positive,1/4/21,i love to make pumpkin muffins and bread i first ordered this product over a year ago when pumpkin was hard to find in the store although i like to use natural organic products pumpkin is not necessarily one of those things that you need to have organic due to the thick rind however the price of this is impossible to pass up with s s the per can price is cheaper than the local store generic i did not think there was much of a difference in taste until recently i made my muffins with another name brand pumpkin my muffins were just ok certainly not as yummy as usual the pumpkin was the only difference so here i am ordering more unless the price shoots up dramatically i will not use anything else i did not realize the dented can thing was a widespread issue if i remember correctly i do think some of my cans in my first order were dented but not badly enough to make them unusable obviously we have eaten them all with delicious results and no ill effects lol update this latest order arrived in perfect shape in a well reinforced box no dents or dings anywhere 
negative,30/6/21,what can i say that you probably do not already know it is monster a caffeine drink that is mostly sugar water the problem is that i can find this much cheaper in regular stores

negative,28/9/21,i feel like you do not get enough noodles for the money it is incredibly expensive there are not that many noodles and i did not feel full from this the noodles do smell once you take them out of the package however they cook up rather easily they will stick together so when you take them out of the water and put them on paper towels make sure that you lay them out otherwise you will have issues later they do not have a taste so make sure that you stir fry them or let them simmer with whatever you are using them with otherwise you will be disappointed sorry but i will not buy them again too much money

positive,20/4/21,these syrup pumps are sometimes hard to find and when i have found them the price is ridiculously high i am pleased to have found these at a reasonable price 
positive,20/4/21,i was a little apprehensive purchasing this entire lb can for consumption by only people however now that we have eaten about half the can in a week i can say that my concern was not valid i love castelvetrano olives and this brand is fantastic my plan was to follow the recommendation of another reviewer and put the olives in a glass jar with water to reduce the brine but at the rate we are devouring them i do not believe that will be necessary my only regret is that i did not purchase more at the same time i will stock up on my next purchase 
positive,21/4/21,i bought this same brand at a local health food store for oz it cost so when i bought this at oz it made economic sense 
positive,2/5/21,cats if you are owned by a cat you know how fussy they can be my adopted feral cat just loves these treats i love spoiling her but they are so expensive at the grocery store now thansk to amazon com i can buy them in multiples the price is cheaper and what can i say about the convenience of having them shipped to the door 
negative,18/12/19,how do you expect me to buy yhis product for this price keurig sells the same item for only less than half the asking price here 
positive,19/1/20,this coffee tastes great best value for kerig system one thing you must do with this coffee after unpacking is put it in a plastic bag to keep fresh you must keep the air out do not put it in the frige keep it room temp if you are a coffee expert like me you will love this coffee rich flavor all flavors are great even the decaf you will save around cents to cents per pod leave it to amazon to bring us this great coffee i am a prime member i save on shipping and handiling become a prime member and save way to go amazon

positive,27/2/20,this tea is overpriced at asian markets retail is certainly wholesale is drastically less the price asked for here is appalling it is the exact same tea and foojoy is considered one of the lesser brands in teas the product is great the seller doubtful 
positive,26/2/21,great product but i pay cents per pouch at our local grocery store here they are selling for over dollars a pouch i was hoping to put a few cases on monthly shipment but given the price i will keep buying them at the grocery store 
positive,18/12/19,we need to buy these for one of our children who has special needs and the price on amazon cannot be beat 
positive,19/1/20,i have been eating carnation instant breakfast for a few years now and this is about as a good a price as i have found i have found it cheaper when on sale at a local store but those sales are rare i use two cups of milk instead of the instructed one so the flavor is diluted a bit but still good 
negative,13/9/20,i personally think the price is high i can get it a lot cheaper elsewhere so that is what i will do 
positive,10/7/20,this product is great for people on who eat plant based whole foods there is no sugar added the product tastes delicious the price however is quite expensive for the size of the jar i found a similar product at a local whole foods grocery store for half the price 
positive,14/4/21,i am not generally a huge fan of keurig coffee makers because they and their k cups are so expensive but my girlfriend has one and she ran out of coffee for it i looked around amazon and found this item it sounded promising so i decided to try it it is the best k cup of coffee i have ever had it has a strong mellow medium roast flavor and it is also the least expensive i have found i signed up for a subscription and will probably keep it going yum 
positive,24/4/21,iam a shopper for quality for less this coffee is a excellant value as it has a great coffee taste i hope this company comes out with some flavored coffees for my afternoon treat 
positive,28/4/21,like many of the other reviewers i have tried all of the premium dog foods out there when our family hit some tough financial times i began looking for a good food that would be a better fit with our budget this food absolutely fits the bill my golden retriever mix is not crazy about it but that does not bother me that much he is a good weight and he will eat it when he is hungry he is had some allergy issues in the past and i was sure this food would kick them into gear but it did not after fully transitioning to this food he has not gotten itchy at all i am definitely going to stick with chicken soup why pay twice as much on dog food if you do not have to 
positive,12/7/21,i was buying these at the pet store for each with this deal you get two for that price i ordered the largest size possible because i know my corgis like to chew the heck out of these they love these i have discovered they prefer the flat ones to the rounded type one that was sent in this deal was just a little curved which makes it harder for their stumpy legs to hold while chewing so they argue over who gets the un bent one if i hold the crooked one then they will chew it but they definitely like the flatter one best a very good value if your dogs are chewers 
positive,18/12/19,much cheaper than buying it in stores and my dog loved it he would spend maybe mins on the granola outer layer and then unwrap the rawhide to eat the middle my dog does not eat rawhide really and always did this with dingo bones too will keep my dog busy for mins or so and he seems to enjoy it so i will probably get this again 
positive,19/1/20,this is a good price and my very picky son eats this tt was delivered on time and i used the amazon subscription to get the price a little lower 
negative,28/4/21,this is just and fyi for you guys you ca buy this exact same box of these exact same noodles at a korean market for around s you can get them for s most placed will still cut you a bulk deal for around a box from any grocery store with an asian section i am sure they are s a piece in california ny or wherever so chill out ninnies do not get ripped off for these if you have got any of the aforementioned within easy access 
positive,8/8/20,what can i say it is ground flax seed the five stars are for the price i used to buy the stuff at walmart who sold it in their baking goods section in a box at a very reasonable price the last time i looked for it the sales lady says oh we moved it to pharmacy section they sure did move it along with repackaging and bumping the price about times as much amazon has a great price but the only drawback is that a pack of jars is a lot of flax seed 
positive,22/5/21,my daughter loves the food and i like it even better because it is organic and amazon has the best price 
positive,18/12/19,i use this olive oil daily this was a great price and the free shipping made it even better 
negative,19/1/20,this product is very good but what with the price plus paying for shipping i was ordering this product for for a pack of boxes and shipping was free i was told a few months ago the cookies would no longer be made i get an e mail that they are in stock again well that is nice but not at the price i can get them a lot less expensive at my local grocery store 
positive,3/8/20,torani syrup sugar free vanilla ounce bottles pack of best price anywhere i use for coffee cereal and yogurt very good 
positive,29/7/21,chex wheat cereal is a product that is been around for a long time and it is never needed improvement it is just about perfect as is it stays crispy has a marvelous flavor and it is even great right out of the box of course it is also an essential part of chex party mix always a favorite having it delivered by amazon at a cheaper price than a local supermarket was a nice surprise 
positive,8/7/20,good price for bottles of syrup the bottle is plastic not glass though 
positive,13/4/21,my oldest son likes this coffee and its price and suggested i use it for guests at our rental vacation property i do use the coffee and have never had a complaint from any of our guests i generally buy the original ground or decaff original and am pleased with both by using subscribe and save this coffee is cheaper than any local store including using a eight of the clock coupon at either walmart or target 
positive,20/2/21,i found this product and price the best i know this is an instant coffee but it has great taste you cannot beat amazon price or service any where 
positive,9/12/20,i drink a gallon a day this is better than regular sugar kool aid and so much cheaper on amazon i order regularly

negative,5/6/21,i used to order this item regularly six jars was however it is now more than that comes out to more than the single jar price in the supermarkets i emailed to ask them if this was the correct price they never responded no reason to order it in bulk anymore online 
positive,25/7/21,i have been very happy with the grove square k cup products i really like the creamy cappuccino french vanilla flavor the french vanilla is great when you want a coffee that is creamy with a light flavor great price cost less then other k cups which is also a great selling point i also like grove square dark chocolate hot cocoa grove square caramel apple cider and think the grove square medium roast is okay it is an instant coffee so it is lighter in flavor but still good 
positive,13/7/21,my cat is used to eating weruva and tiki cat so i was not sure how he would take to this brand this does not look at all like the previous two brands which actually look like people food whereas bff brand looks like typical cat food lou is not normally picky but he does not eat this food quite as quickly as tiki or weruva i bought two cases of tuna bonito and tuna shrimp and while it is a good price i think next time we will stick to weruva for big cans of food and tiki for small cans he gets one big can in the am and one small can in the pm i would buy this stuff again in the future if i was in a pinch as it is not a bad food i just like my cats food to look more like real fish or chicken vs over processed stuff but good ingredients and grain free at a good price 
positive,9/7/21,uhhh you can get one of these ounce jars at the grocery store for wtf the sauce is indeed the best but bucks really
negative,8/7/21,this is ridiculous i shop amazon all the time and i am definitely pro amazon but the price on the package of thomas english muffins is insane for one package of you can purchase a pack at walmart for who would pay this price amazon you get it right of the time and are spot on but maybe not on your food prices this is the first time i have checked prices on food today show just did a segment and i had to check it out and sure enough your muffins are 
positive,15/7/21,these do taste better than the cheap brands like maruchuan and you get a slightly larger block but these are way more expensive i have seen them in local wal marts for a slightly lower price overall they do have a good flavor not too salty or mushy 
negative,6/7/21,i was expecting or hoping for a different variet of tazo since i love the awake and the zen so much what i received was a brown paper bag with awake and zen and small tea bag of peppermint the reason i gave it star is that i love tazo k cups but not for that price i could have times the amount for that price 
positive,13/8/21,this candy can be purchased anywhere fom a box to cents a box i ordered cases of it at cents a box and i thought i got a fair deal

positive,6/9/21,i want to say this coffee is very good have had no issues with bad pods check your machine if you are having issues with pod breaking open sometimes the needle get clongged or worn and you will start having this issue i love the price of this coffee great taste you will see the price of kerig pods come down soon the patent has expired
positive,5/6/21,i am really enjoying this coffee it tastes excellent was nicely priced and the company has gone out of their way to provide excellent customer service after some initial problems i am going to get this monthly on subscribe and save and i do recommend it now the brooklyn bridge and breakfast blend are very nice 
positive,9/7/21,i used to buy cet s from the vet but these are almost half the price ship free with prime cannot beat that 
positive,19/6/21,a great product at a great price these little slim jim snacks taste much better than the full version sold in convenience stores not sure why but they do others have written the same thing very convenient box and easy to store makes a great adder for school lunches and etc or just a quick snack on the run

positive,26/8/21,living in the city it is hard to find pectin at the local grocery so this is a great price and delivered right to my door 
positive,26/7/21,ok the package says that these are ese pods they look the same as other ese pods have the same shape and size as other ese pods that i have around and weigh the same as other ese pods as far as i can tell these pods even brew for about as long other ese pods using my saeco espresso classico machine i do not know whether it is the grind that lavazza uses but the lavazza pods do not seem to be as tightly packed as other ese pods and the resulting espresso is slightly less strong than the espresso made by the other ese pods that being said the espresso is perfectly acceptable particularly when you take into account the price that you pay when you go on amazon s subscription plan 
positive,11/9/21,i ordered this when i found a few indian recipes that i wanted to try it would have been outrageous for me to buy all the spices individually but thankfully i found this all the spices come in separate baggies my only complaint is that when they arrived they were all jumbled up but there is a list that tells you where each one goes in the box and it was simple to follow so it was no big deal 
positive,11/9/21,i was having problems finding good reasonably priced beans out of season here they are 
positive,15/9/21,i have tried a lot of hazelnut coffees and this is my favorite the k cups perform well unlike another brand whose name i will not mention wp and the flavor is much bolder than every other brand green mountain used to have a bold one but it was discontinued except in sample packs with other flavors this coffee has a nice taste too i just wish i could find it locally and for less money you used to be able to get a bundle of large boxes from amazon but they are not currently available i think this was the best price i could get but was disappointed when i received my tiny boxes if you overlooked it these boxes only contain k cups each i will keep looking for better value but in the meantime i can still enjoy a good cup of coffee made at home i gave it only four stars because of the price but i do recommend this coffee 
positive,5/6/21,my wife is a tea lover she finds stash premium white christmas tea soothing delightful i thought the price was great too 
positive,9/7/21,i love this tea and can only find it at around the holidays what a great find i was able to order a large amount for a great price 
positive,14/9/21,the price at amazon varies for this product it is competitive unless it gets to almost for quality is good 
positive,29/9/21,i love nescafe taster s choice coffee i had been using the gourmet roast but when my blood pressure became slightly elevated i switched to the decaf it is delicious and my blood pressure is now behaving i love being able to buy this product for such a fair price 
positive,10/7/21,i used to use the other popular brand that cost times more this brand is better at the price this product has a very rich pink color from what i have read the source of the pink color is where the health benefits of himalayan salt come from the deep pink color of this salt would indicate a very healthy product and its tasty too 
negative,1/3/20,i would not mind paying the price if the coffee was any good the beans smell like burnt coffee unlike any other french roast i have picked up this leads to a very bitter and burnt taste throughout there is simply nothing special about this expensive coffee 
negative,28/7/20, percent of this candy and these brands are still sold in stores today you could pay dollars at the grocery store and probably get times as much candy for the money 
positive,28/7/20,this is really good coffee and the price is right my husband enjoyed this coffee as well 
negative,10/11/19,i have been buying this for years it has always been two boxes of pods each for the recently the price has doubled to one box of pods for greed i have been forced to shop for other brands and surprising i do like the other brands 
positive,1/3/20,this is a great value on a great product i use this daily on my skin as a moisturizer and for cooking cannot beat the quality or the price 
positive,3/8/19,i have gotten this product in smaller jars before and was very pleased so to save money i ordered the gallon tub the coconut oil in the tub seems to have less flavor than the jars or maybe it was that particular batch i will know better after i try the next gallon tub i will order this product again may i am half way thru my second gallon of this product and the taste is very good my only wish now is that it was cold pressed unheated 
negative,6/2/21,i am looking at a can of nido ounces grams for which i paid plus sales tax yesterday at walmart the one star rating is for your creative pricing not the product i would give the product stars 
positive,24/2/21,like the previous reviewer i have found the price when using subscribe and save to be better than any that i can find anywhere else these are quality pumpkin seeds hopefully they will be good for my prostate excellent in cereal or in a smoothie recommended 
negative,13/5/21,you can buy same pack from grocery store for anyone who would buy this for that expensive price will be stupid 
positive,1/3/20,i agree that this is agreat product but i got it at king arthur flour co for per pound 
positive,28/7/20,i order this tea every couple of months from amazon for the great price and it is the best powered arizona tea the taste is great my kids love it no caffeine or sugar too it is also difficult to find this product in stores highly recommend it 
negative,13/5/20,omg this was for boxes and i just bought it for less then a box if i would have seen this before i bought it at weis markets i would have never paid this price i thought it was containers of boxes for a total of boxes what a dummy i was for buying this do not waste your money here
positive,26/3/21,plants were very well packaged and all specimens are in excellent health and condition arrived well before the estimated delivery date in fact took only over a day to get here seller has great communication even emailing prior to shipment arriving with care instructions and when the product would arrive the seller also threw in a bottle of fertilizer at no extra charge saved me alot of money over buying locally can not express how happy i am with this experience will definitely order again

positive,7/8/20,very happy with this product price was great we liked it a lot we would recomend it to other people
positive,1/3/20,this is the only rice cereal we use for my son he has had bad acid reflux and of course needs cereal in every bottle so we go through a good bit after comparing proces this is the cheapest we have found though only pennies in difference you cannot beat the fact that it is free shipping and comes straight to your door 
positive,28/7/20,my mom drinks a cup or two of tea everyday and makes iced tea so we go through these pretty fast amazon has a great price 
positive,14/9/21,this coffee looks like its a collection of beans which has been swept up off the floor afer a days roasting which is not meant as a criticism that is what i would expect poor mans blend to be but seriously its very consistently decent coffee you cannot beat it for the subscription price i think i am on my bag s and am hooked there are certainly better coffees but not for the poor man me 
positive,17/12/20,this product is way over priced i bought the same thing for at my local safeway and k mart my two dogs love them and i give them as a treat 
positive,2/5/20,this was an awesome price for the amount of ounces and it serves the purpose of the purchase i would definitely recommend this to others seeking black walnut extract thanks 
positive,14/7/21,i have very long thick hair and have been coloring it for years so no matter how often i get my hair trimmed most of it is dry and fairly fragile although the aroma of this product is a little lighter than the others products of this line that i have tried it is still a little over powering for my taste my hair scent clashes with my perfume i hate that and that is why i try always to purchase fragrance free products but that issue aside this product seems to do what it claims to do i am always looking for an inexpensive product that may be the equivalent of a salon product well i am sorry there just are not any but this conditioner comes slightly closer than most i did seem to see less hair in my comb as i was combing my hair out after my shower my scalp seems to bee less dry and my comb ran through my hair quite easily after drying and using the heated flate iron on my hair it appeared silky somewhat shiny and was quite easy to manage 
positive,18/7/19,i get these all the time and this seller has a good price best on the web so far and just the rite size too not too big and there hard all the way through iv had some the crumbled about through 
positive,1/3/20,i have a delicious recipe for pumpkin muffins that i make again and again and i am tired of spending too much money on the little supermarket jars of pumpkin pie spice the quality and taste of this product is just as good for a fraction of the cost 
negative,28/7/20,these snacks are great but the price is beyond absurd these are each in wal mart here it is each price gouging at it is best what a joke 
positive,13/6/20,i have been using coconut oil in my morning coffee for months and believe it has helped lessen chronic inflammation not only was it cheaper to buy in bulk the smaller size is easier to store 
negative,10/3/20,this product is hackleback sturgeon roe which is very good the problem i have with the supplier is that it is over priced one may purchase this product from marky s caviar the exact same caviar from markys for a little over dollars for oz not dollars for oz the shipping for this product is also outrageous if you like this product which i did get the most for your money from marky s caviar and forget charleston seafood i had even called charleston and they were not able to help me when confronted with the facts so poor customer service 
positive,9/5/20,i love this soup very hard to find in florida thank you amazon for stocking it

negative,19/10/20,omg this is a rip off i live in texas where you can buy a pack of faygo for under bucks this is really good soda the product itself is great but way overpriced i am disappointed 
positive,1/3/20,my son age has food allergies wheat soy dairy peanut so he knows when he sees enjoy life on the package he can actually have it and it is great for him to have options w different flavor cookies it makes it easier for me when i have to pack his lunch for school to give him something different each day the only thing i would love to have on the subscribe and save program is the ability to mix and match products but the product itself is great my son says they have a little bit of a bite to them but that is how ginger cookies are he compares these to the pamela s ginger snaps he likes both but sometimes he likes to have the soft ginger cookies which is the enjoy life type 
positive,28/7/20,the title says it all this is a great oil and the price is right my shipment came promptly avocado oil is great for cooking and has many health benefits 
positive,7/3/20,i was very happy with this product coconut oil in mac and cheese gives it a little hint of tropical taste without overwhelming the dish i ordered this in february the cooler part of the year and it arrived in perfect condition some others have written that they were not happy because it apparently leaked all over the place this is probably due to the product becoming liquid at degrees my oil was solid when it arrived and did not have this problem i hope amazon can resolve this issue quickly 
positive,4/8/20,i am new to coconut oil the cost is what kept me from trying it sooner this is the best deal i have ever run across and the product is excellent 
positive,26/12/19,i buy all of my pets food on amazon the prices are great and with the free shipping over it is a win win deal 
positive,28/3/21,i was at wal mart today and compared pricing a box for oz it was around at wal mart for oz in their store brand so the real deal is slightly cheaper and shows right up at the door cannot beat it i wish the prices were as good on other cereal on amazon as a bonus these boxes came with a spider man movie ticket promotion so i ordered more to get free tickets for my family via the promotion consider that the cereal was almost free 
positive,6/2/20,i bought two jars of this cayenne pepper for my grandpa who uses cayenne pepper to make a squirrel repellant blend of bird seed works just as well as the overpriced retail brands from the supermarket this is the best price for bulk cayenne pepper i have seen and it shipped exceptionally quickly 
positive,25/4/21,my children love this cereal the price is great i cannot do much better with a coupon and sam s cannot touch it the cereal arrives fresh and in great condition it is awesome that i do not have to run to the store with all four kids in tow when we start to run low thanks amazon 
positive,3/8/20,since moving towards a more natural lifestyle i have found cashews to be in quite a few recipes so i was so happy when i saw this great deal 
negative,15/4/19,i should have done my research first basically over a per jar i can get a way better deal by going to the store total ripoff i will continue to buy beech nut just not from this person 
positive,9/3/18,gloria jean s coffee is delicious hazelnut is my favorite flavor it is convenient that this coffee comes in boxes of so i do not have to stock up on k cups very often and the price is very good 
positive,18/5/18,we love the hazelnut coffee in our house great flavor and the coffee is not bitter or too strong i also love the price buying it here in a pack of makes it cheaper than any of the stores in our city 
positive,9/3/18,uncle purchase k cup keurig brewer for my office my staff and i love it no arguments about who is going to clean up the coffee at the end of the day who is to blame for not turning it off and coffee burning at the bottom of the jug plus we can have a selection of different coffees to suite the tastes for anyone we love it the gloria jean s hazelnut is a very flavorful but not a strong coffee i prefer the jet fuel brand but for the tamer coffee drinkers in the office they swear by it 
negative,27/2/18,very very overpriced starbucks k cup for you can get from bjs sams club or costco a count starbucks k cup for which is a way better deal 
positive,20/2/18,great product and the pricing on amazon is pretty much impossible to beat you get about bottles on amazon for the price of one at most places i use this syrup mostly for lattes
positive,22/3/18,these are the only rose hips i have had in my life so i do not have any standard of comparison tastes good to me though i became interested in these because of joint gum problems and hearing that vitamin c could help with that i figured that bioflavonoids other compounds may be important for absorbing vitamin c and i would probably be better off getting it from a whole food than from a supplement not that there is anything wrong with supplements just my way of thinking anyway i mostly use these for making soaked tea or just iced tea d basically i just put a good amount of these in a bottle filled with a couple cups of water around tablespoons shake it up stick that in the refrigerator then shake it up really well the next day when the rose hips are softened that is when the water takes on a rich orange light amber color and noticeably thickens up maybe from the pectin that i am assuming is in the rose hips and also tastes great shaking it really well helps to disperse all the flavor keep that in mind i eat the rose hips too after soaking overnight and they taste good as well but a little strong eating a lot of them i have made tea with them and i enjoy that a lot but i thought that heating it up so much would destroy a lot of the vitamin c if you are drinking it for enjoyment it does not really matter what you do and the rose hip tea i made with these rose hips tasted great you have to use a good amount of rose hips to get that tangy sour flavor for making cup i would at least use a couple tablespoons but that is just me everyone has their preferences overall i think it is very pleasant and refreshing though i prefer it unheated and just soaked and shaken i make kefir and adding these to the ripening under airlock phase can make an interesting brew there is a lot you can do with these things so do not be afraid to get creative as for this specific brand as i said it is the only one i have tried so i do not have a standard of comparison but i am satisfied with these think they taste fine and they were sold for a great price no complaints here 
positive,12/3/18,i am so happy i finally found these on here to the person who gave a star because they are you may be able to go in a store and pay a box if your like the rest of us who are from ny nj etc and moved to the west coast you cannot find these anywhere i usually stock up on these when i go back to ny but its nice to know i can order them whenever i want 
positive,9/2/18,i love the peter pan brand and i am pleased with the price time to stock up so i did 
positive,7/12/17,it is so hard to find no sodium seasonings other than mrs dash this is a great product at a great price 
positive,24/5/19,i was a little surprised by the problems experienced by soulwriterchick per her review four adult cats in our house two with sensitive gut or skin have been eating this stuff for two months they like it after several tentative days as well as the similar quality but too expensive halo spot s stew natural dry cat food their preference for this food is the same as their preference for the much cheaper by the lb bag iams adult active maturity natural balance has better ingredients though comparing these products with science diet they like the new science diet age defying senior dry cat food best by flavor costs almost as much as halo but the science diet foods have ingredients no better in quality than the far cheaper iams and the cats all of them eat far too much of the science diet or act like they are starving making it the least economical of the bunch it is clear the scientists at science diet have developed some kind of kittie cocaine grrr update after another month of use i find the gang after getting used to the non standard taste have migrated to this dry food and have not been eating as much of the iams or a sensitive cat purina product they also like the halo product a lot now month update a recent emotional blow for the cats losing their older brother seems to have made them very fussy about food i had also made the mistake of giving them some canned food a few months back a big mistake anyhow at present they are refusing to eat this natural balance dry food it is good stuff i just have to figure out how to get them back on track 
positive,9/3/18,it came pretty quick was at an unbeatable price and was the same good hot cereal i get from the store no damage or anything not much else to say 
positive,18/5/18,i have been a loyal coffee bean direct customer for a couple years now we mostly prefer the dark sumatra but have tried a few others as well we find the dark sumatra to be the boldest while very low in acid this means you can make it as strong as you like without the upset stomach highly recommend both the dark sumatra and the seller 
positive,23/3/18,i order this tuna for my daugter who is in afganastan every few months she loves it they are limited what is available to eat and this usually makes her day 
positive,8/9/20,we really prefer the scented bags to the unscented but they cost so much more at the pet stores we were so happy to find them here for such a great price 
positive,23/2/18,the price was great as we saved quite a bit of money compared to retail outlets the delivery was prompt and we were lucky to get it under a free shipping promotion the product itself is one of the best scone mixes that we have tried 
positive,18/7/20,i have used this product for many years love the flavor but buy it at kroger s it is one third the cost mexene original chili powder seasoning oz it is a oz jar 
negative,14/6/18,the sole reason i purchased the tassimo machine was because i love starbucks coffee i think it is disgraceful the prices that are being charged for the t discs for starbucks coffee since starbucks discontinued their relationship with tassimo on average it is close to a t disc something is very wrong with this picture 
positive,2/11/18,this is a great price and to have it have it delivered by weekly cannot go wrong and the coffee is good
positive,14/10/18,pricey but good ok sixteen more words to say the same thing pricey but good four more words
positive,6/4/20,shame on you these are great mixers and the packs are on sale at target for just under bucks each

positive,24/1/19,this formula has been the best for our baby he has not had one problem with this formula the price you cannot beat usually one can is with subscribe save it comes out to about can 
positive,27/2/19,great value for an organic infant formula we have the subscription model which gets the price lower comparable canisters cost at least a canister our baby loved the product from day one 
positive,19/4/20,i ordered cans of earth s best organic formula and i got them in time as scheduled we have been using it since my daughter was weeks old she is month old now and she loves it it is cheaper to order it online then buy it from babiesrus 
positive,17/4/20,i was first introduced to these little gems at sam s club but they no longer carry them so i turned to amazon and found a great price on a product i hope to keep using for years it is the first and only individual serving drink mix diet tea i have found that is sweetened with splenda i do not do aspartame delicious too 
positive,3/4/20,good product for a good price would order again and probably when our pup gets to be an adult we we order the adult food 
positive,7/8/19,what else is there to say a great strong flavored coffee at a great price 
negative,9/3/18,this coffe was over priced and not a true french roast i would not describe it as dark or bold in flavor would have been helpful if a price per pod was added 
positive,18/5/18,first off i love these torani sugar free syrups it is a great no calorie way to sweeten and add flavor to your coffee i purchased my first bottle locally in a gourmet shop for about buying the three pack on amazon is like getting a bottle for free fyi bottles from amazon are plastic which i do not mind at all less likely i will break them while stumbling through my morning routine great price fast delivery 
negative,27/1/19,you can order the same products online from nespresso for approx nespresso makes great machines and great coffee pods these pod offers on amazon however are mostly from third party vendors they prey on people who do not know better charging you the price of ordering the pods directly from nespresso i have been ordering through nespresso s website for a couple of years now and their shipping times are always fast and reliable i buy many things through amazon but not nespresso pods 
positive,10/11/19,great priced total envelopes pack box almost half of what we pay in the stores excellent for traveling 
positive,8/11/19,i sent this case of soup to my son great deal and i know he has food for now

positive,8/5/20,i have this on autoship maple syrup is sooo expensive in the grocery store and you only get a small bottle i have a family of i love the autoship and you cannot beat the price tastes great too 
positive,28/9/18,these are and will always be delicious they are hard to find and was pleased to find it on amazon at a great price best price found anywhere my kids love the chocolate but the vanilla were even a better deal and of course also delicious give it a try you will not regret it 
positive,29/7/19,this is my favorite tea for the keurig i love it and this was the best price i could find 
negative,9/3/18,i did not look closely enough at the price i thought sold in packs meant packages when i received little marshmallows for shipping and handling i was floored i have made homemade marshmallows and the contents do not cost very much 
negative,18/5/18,i only received one box of seven packs of snack packs for usually i receive boxes of seven packs for this price so total packs not i should have been more wary 
positive,17/5/20,for just about this canister gives you about cups of coffee that is just over a nickel a cup you cannot beat that that means that for the same money as premium coffees like starbucks or seattle s best you can get cups assuming a cup if you took a day for days a week for a year you would be spending just on coffee alone money you can save for a car or down payment even if the starbucks tastes a little better is it really worth it this coffee does not taste as good as premium but it does not taste bad either so coffee afficionados would not be as let down as they think and honestly that starbucks via stuff is way too expensive at a cup granted instant is not as good as a really fresh cup of freshly ground coffee but it tastes better than most coffee because most coffee is not freshly ground especially the pre ground coffee in bricks or cans because freeze dried retains freshness a longer time if it is kept air sealed you get a fresh cup almost every time there are only two big downsides to the ounce containers first by the time you get to the bottom of the canister you might experience some staleness this is because of exposure to air which affects even freeze dried coffee one possible solution is to seal small batches and keep them away from light and heat it is easy to add too much instant coffee to a cup it only takes a teaspoon to a teaspoon and a half for one cup nothing more it only takes a little to make a cup overall nescafe taster s choice offers a great balance between cost savings and taste is it as good as fresh brewed perhaps not especially if you can get freshly ground coffee that you make yourself but it is certainly better than most coffee you get at say a diner or restaurant cafes make it better but at a cup they are not worth it unless just as an occasional indulgence if you are one of those people who has always scoffed at instant i would say at least give this a try 
positive,26/3/20,we recently switched to formula and i have been looking all over for the cheapest price on our preferred formula this was the cheapest price that i found anywhere including the manufacturer and local big box stores my package came in the advertised packaging unlike some other reviews i was very happy with the price the product and the value 
negative,24/2/20,this bag is extremely over priced i can buy this at winco for cents when it is on sale just wanted my fellow amazonians to get the best price 
positive,3/5/19,this is the best priced coconut flour i could find my recipes do not call for a whole lot of it at a time so i hope it stays fresh for a while i did have a problem with the recloseable zip lock bag it does not work so i have to roll it down and close it with a closepin i hope the other bags are better

positive,13/1/20,i have purchased these a couple times for my two dogs great price even with the expensive shipping charge and long lasting there is nothing worse than paying for a dog chew and then watching your dog eat it in less than minutes 
positive,21/9/20,using keurig cups is so great but also expensive it is a luxury i will have to give up after retirement but the ease of trying so many different coffees is really great and i have enjoyed the coffee and the makers immensely 
positive,2/12/20,i have been ordering dried cherries by mail for several years now from another source these cherries are just as good as my previous source at a better price thanks to amazon prime 
positive,20/11/19,you can by at kroger at half the price used to be cheaper before recent price hike just continued from innertia to order until payed attention people be careful 
negative,2/12/20,over priced for what you can get from the manufacturer directly and also have a much larger selection of different coffees as well as the new chocolate flavor do not understand why anyone would buy used coffee by its nature coffee cannot be used
positive,11/12/19,cliff bars stopped making my favorite foodbar organic nectar cocoa walnut dates was one of the main ingredients i have multiple food allergies and this was one of the only foodbars i liked and was ok for me i wrote to cliff expressing my sadness about discontinued item and was even more disappointed to not receive any response so thanks to the internet and bloggers i was able to come up with a receipe to make my own cliff bar knock offs thank you i have bought these dates several times and have always been pleased hope amazon com continues to carry 
positive,20/11/19,i purchased this via amazon because i am never sure i will be able to find it locally and not have it cost an arm a leg and firstborn male child you cannot beat the price and the knowledge i will not have to comb the grocery stores looking made it a win win not only that but each container i received had a cent coupon attached so if i do find it locally i can enjoy a great discount 
positive,28/6/20,i have not recieved the noodles yet but i am very impressed with the price with my sights set on making a soba dish i headed to the grocery store to find that an eight ounce package of soba noodles was selling for and my recipe called for twelve ounces i just could not see paying for a simple noodle dish as an experiment i bought one package of soba noodles and one package of udon to see if the soba noodles were really necessary the soba noodles were significantly better for this dish so i was resigned to have to pay so much for my yummy dish then i came here to and found that i can get a larger package of noodles for a little over per package after shipping i was very pleased i hope they taste good i will be back for more as i think i am becoming addicted to soba noodles 
negative,8/8/20,guess for all those desparate germans living in the states get it in germany less than one 
negative,14/7/21,this is a great product and my daughter loves them she is been eating them since she was months old however this is extremely overpriced they are a pack at publix a pack is nuts 
positive,2/12/20,these are really good but its a stretch to pay that much for them i would buy them more often if the price was lower energ brand is more resonably priced 
positive,20/11/19,love these but per package that is crazy when they went for in the stores meijer walmart kroger nice flavor and my favorite but no way would pay this much for what is essentially sugarfree koolaid 
positive,1/3/21,i am a dolce gusto user for a long time and this was the best price i could find for this product so i would recommend that due to that 
positive,5/5/21,cremora is a fine product but very hard to find it is available online but at ridiculous prices would be pleased to find an alternate source 
negative,2/12/20,i am very dissapointed in amazon on this one anything that i buy on a consistent basis i buy through amazon whether it is electronics books toys diapers etc amazon always comes through with an unbelievable deal on this product they have missed the boat badly i can understand higher than the store i can live with that i will buy in bulk through amazon just for convienence however this product can be purchased an any target or major grocery chain mine at least kroger for or if i were to buy of these concetrates at target with tax it would run me close to this is less than the sale price that amazon is offering this is the same concentrate used by starbucks this is why i use it to save money by making it on my own unfortunately with the price point i would be better off having someone make it for me 
positive,20/11/19,i like this coffee for me finding this on amazon was a true buy as i had this while in new orleans for the price for the taste and it is a family owned operation that is all i need you will not be disappointed in the french roast

positive,12/2/21,i checked with my vet after purchasing these online for my cats and the difference in price is cheaper on amazon than at the vet s office great deal 
positive,2/12/20,my vet recommended these treats to help with my cats tartar build up the treats come in a wrapper which i think is edible but i take it off one cat loves these treats and the other will not touch them but the amzn price is so so much cheaper about the cost than the vets price i would not buy them anywhere but amzn 
positive,20/11/19,i have used stevia for a long time and love the natural product this is a good price as i normally spend around for only one bottle half the size of these oz ones 
positive,25/6/21,way overpriced jewel has this for same bag size and look at the overpriced shipping cost 
negative,17/3/20,the price doubled and is now over too much for ounce boxes company is too greedy i use to buy this regularly but i will no more
positive,20/10/21,i prefer pu erhs that are earthy slightly smoky and finish smoothly while this tea does not completely fit this profile it will do it is not as good as some pricier pu erhs but it is as good an everyday tea as i have found other tea lovers in my family have adopted it as their regular morning tea even though they are not the pu erh aficionados that i am 
positive,21/7/20,i love goya tomato sauce and its not sold in my town amazon had it cheaper than i normally pay plus the added bonus of not having to drive minutes and pay taxes on it the only downside would be the mail carrier more than half the cans arrived dented amazon was nice enough to refund some of the cost 
positive,22/2/21,a lot cheaper than the store and the bulk will make it last a little longer than usual always great flavor and constancy with this product
negative,8/6/21,i must be out of my mind to pay this much for almond milk i meant organic almond milk at whole food and trader s joe is about a piece i did not pay attention i have always assumed that i could get a better deal from amazon in this case it is not lesson learned 
positive,2/12/20,i tried this product because i have relatives who are diabetic and i am always looking for low carb alternatives the muffins have a somewhat cornbread kind of taste and were a little dull in taste i added a few frozen blueberries and this helped a lot my only complaint is that these mixes are quite expensive and i may not be able to order as many as i would like they will have to be a treat rather than a staple too bad 
positive,20/11/19,with the economy so tight i feel fortunate to have found the cat food my cats like for a price i can afford thanks 
positive,25/1/21,this was a great price as opposed to the wal mart price for the same brand my kids love to eat these as an after school snack and this price allows me to provide them with this olivia
positive,1/7/21,not much you can say about this product the are what it says the balance between nuts is fair the price was great and while i doubt that each package is exactly calories it is was a great deal most important were the price and the nuts as stated good price compared to local markets including target and they are fresh nuff said
positive,30/9/20,case pricing is very favorable great to have a stock on hand for preparing meals for the freezer super quick shipping

positive,26/7/21,this price does not even begin to be competitive with my local grocery stores let alone sam s club or walmart 
negative,21/10/21,i bought this item for my granddaughter s birthday thought by the info that it would be more creative and crafty it turned out to be mostly candy not worth the price at all the box looked nice and attractive except for one corner being severly dented consequently their packageing also needs some work 
positive,25/10/21,the coffee itself is great but how can amazon be charging for a count box when msrp is and you can find it at specialty shops for around 
positive,29/6/21,i brought this because it was on sale but my dogs love this stuff very fresh and moist will order again when on sale 
positive,5/7/21,these are the same treats that my vet sells but they are cheaper on line the delivery was fast and ordering was easy dog loves them

positive,18/10/21,great price for a lot of creamer just a bit at a loss of what to do with a giant box of creamers was hoping they would come packed a little differently but it is not a big deal 
negative,29/6/21,wayyyyy overpriced k cups should average you around cents a cup 
negative,16/9/21,this is the most expensive coconut juice i have ever purchased for some reason i thought it would taste more natural and refreshing than goya or foco which tastes more sweet than natural nope i was wrong it tastes exactly the same as the others and has the same exact ingredients from thailand 
negative,24/8/21,i see alot of good reviews for this product it had the ingrediants i was looking for at a great price unfortunately my cat just did not go for it we usually get blue buffalo or taste of the wild 
positive,24/6/21,i live in indianapolis an have paid as much as the low side is but they sell out fast at that locition so believe me this is worth it pluse a very good product i love them

negative,31/7/21,this is the most expensive water i have seen who are they marketing to lottery winners only nobody should pay this much 
negative,11/9/21,the exact same brand of rice is available at our local store for a of the price the current price on here is a whopping not including shipping yikes o it is decent rice the last time i bought it it lasted over a year we kept it in the closet just folded the top part up and put something decently heavy on it since it is not really easy to seal back up after you have opened it 
positive,12/8/21,love the large size gevalia morning roast it makes about mugs of coffee just enough to keep you going through the morning the flavor is perfect not too strong and not bitter the three pack is a great value this price is way better than buying from the grocery store or department stores a wonderful way to start your day 
positive,31/7/20,i really like the cappucino flavor of this soy milk and drink it daily at breakfast i have given it a star rating but find that it is much too pricey from amazon i will continue to purchase it at my local market for less than a carton 
positive,13/6/20,i think this is new on the market and got a free sample it tastes delicious like pina colada but not too sweet heavy low cal and uses sucralose aka splenda which is closer to natural sugar and supposedly better for you then aspartame nutrasweet would be even better with stevia but at a pop that is to get your vitamin d each month still if you are into fufu nutritional drinks and you got the money to spend this is one of the better ones i have run across if i could get it for under a pop i could get hooked on it these guys are obviously competing with the likes of vitamin water which comes in oz bottles instead of and can be had for cheaper interesting bottle shape though they will have to probably drop the price or say bye bye at least in this economy 
positive,31/7/20,our dogs really go crazy for these they are really good for their teeth and they seem to be able to digest them easily they are small dogs so i let them have them for about or minutes and then i take them away bully sticks are really expensive at the pet store i saw two for about bucks too much these are a great deal

positive,5/12/20,i lived in italy and grew very accustomed to great coffee lavblu is as good as any i have had it costs a bit more in stores so if you order more than three cans or so it is probably saving you money if you order six or so as i do even with the shipping it is a bargain buy the rosa if you are making on the stove as this is too fine for a stove with a machine it is just outstanding new lines sales is easy to deal with quick and responsive
positive,1/11/20,i personally love this cereal and i know it maybe too plain for some but you have the option of being creative with this helps me keep calories in check 
positive,14/1/21,good product good price just be prepared to eat a lot of grits lol i kind of got tired of grits and donated boxes to a food pantry however it had nothing to do with the quality of the product boxes is a lot of grits to eat next time i think i will spring for the variety pack with the cheese flavors in them 
positive,6/6/21,we have enjoyed eight of the clock coffee for several years i keep an eye on the price at the local grocery stores and try to stock up when it goes on sale which is not often amazon has been putting the whole beans on sale rather regularly and the price is far better than the grocery store the beans store well in the freezer it is delivered right to your door so what is not to love about that

positive,30/1/21,we found this pearl sugar after looking at a recipe in a king arthur flour catalog it seems to be quite a bit cheaper then what you would pay at most specialty shops my wife uses it with swedish braided bread good stuff 
positive,1/1/21,i have to admit as far as this little luxury of maple syrup goes it is all about price kirkland products tend to be of good quality and fair pricing though so always a good place to start since maple syrup is a single ingredient food and not something i eat every day i really do not find all that much variation in taste from one brand to the next this kirkland syrup tastes just as good as about any other with important consideration for comparisons being fair i e of the same color grade i did not find this to be thinner than other brands either great on pancakes waffles crepes aebleskiver i have also recently started experimenting with using maple syrup instead of sugar in for certain recipes as it is a more pure less processed form of sweetening pleased with this product and recommended 
positive,11/1/21,bought this to put in party favor bags price was great item arrived quickly and fruit snacks tasted great would definitely order again

positive,18/6/21,this is a large amount of crystalized ginger and i do not think you could beat the price i would have preferred it to be a bit more sweet to offset the heat of the ginger but it is still good 
positive,18/6/21,these pumpkin seeds were exactly the same as the ones they sell at markets for nearly for half the price 
positive,7/7/21,this coffee has become my morning ritual because in my opinion it is the best coffee pod for the price out there though i have not tried the other melitta roasts those are next on my list it is so dark and rich with a chocolate taste and a great body reminds me of a good americano blows a starbucks americano out of the water i have found the best method to getting the best out of this pod is to brew it using about ounces of water with my bunn mc pod brewer on the tea setting this makes a very strong brew so i add about or ounces of hot water to round it out my only complaint about these pods is the consistency it seems like i get a bad bitter tasting pod here and there there is also kind of a dry aftertaste but in all honesty it could be something i am not doing right in the brewing process i am only taking off one star since i do not know what the issue is otherwise i am very very pleased with this coffee i have not felt the need to go to a coffee shop since i purchased it i will definitely be buying again 
positive,18/6/21,when i order the beans i had opened the lid and the seal was already broken like it had been pushed in and i did not want to eat them nor give them to my husband so i had contacted the seller through amazon and they said throw them away and we will send you a new batch and they did just that no hassle and no problem and they shipped pretty fast these beans very very good compared to some we are coffee lovers and dark chocolate lovers so we had to try this pair and glad we did oh did i mention it has a real coffee bean lol some that we have tried was like ground coffee bean bits not the whole bean so over all good price quality and the amount and it is yummy 
positive,7/7/21,i have always been a little anxious to purchase groceries online but i gave it a shot with this product and i am satisfied great price and awesome product if you are worried about purchasing it just try it you will not regret it 
positive,1/7/21,the caraway seeds are a really good value i did encounter a problem with the time it took for the order to arrive i bake for a farmers market and was depending on receiving the seeds on the date that i was given apparently there was a problem with the bags and had they just let me know i would have not kept expecting them i finally contacted amazon concerning my order and was then advised of the delay i would order these caraway seeds again as they are fresh and well packed to stay that way i hope i never have to resort to buying them in the grocery store again 
positive,7/7/21,i use this flour to bake bread for my grandson who is on a gluten free diet i like the fact that is has no additives and that it is organic cannot beat the price

positive,18/6/21,so much less expensive than other brands not very informative packaging though and who knows if it is organic or what a little clumpy but hey as far as having no sugar staples in the house you cannot beat the price 
positive,7/7/21,i have tried different kinds of oolongs and found this tea to have a very rich woodsy taste it brews a dark red brown color in comparison to some other lighter oolongs which brew golden although it tastes quite strong which i like it lacks the sweet aromatic flavors that i love in a previous oolong i have tasted those tend to be much more expensive so i settled for this one it tastes pretty good seems good quality for the price i am pretty much addicted to oolong tea so i needed something that i could buy at a good price still enjoy 
negative,27/6/21,i was advised by a health care professional to eat prunes daily as a means of supplementing my fiber intake i was skeptical but i gave it a try i discovered to my mild astonishment that prunes can taste better than i remembered them from distant past experiences and here they are available on amazon the prunes are available as a kirkland product and costco shoppers realize that kirkland is the costco store brand or something like that so i was further actually astonished to discover that my local costco store sells this same product pound bag for the amount of instead of the to price as they are on amazon why should anyone pay that much when the same item is sold in costco stores for is this some kind of a gouge 
negative,21/7/21,this is regularly per on sale at local grocery stores even the msrp is only buyer beware 
positive,18/6/21,i had tried several stevia products in the past and always threw them out because they were awful this one is pretty good i admit it is not the best tasting sweetener but i suppose it is the healthiest alternative so far as we know anyways thus it is the one i use i use to use equal many years ago but it gave me a headache and i found out it was a neurotoxin then i started using splenda which is the best in my opinion as far as taste goes but now you hear about it not being that great either healthwise being chlorinated and all so i stopped using it then i tried truvia like i said it is not the best it does leave a bit of an aftertaste with tea and using it for whipped cream did not work at all i ended up having to add a bunch of powdered sugar to the cream to make it edible i primarily use it to sweeten my greek yogurt with berries as i still need a touch of sweetness so one packet is great tastes good i also use it for my other low carb dessert oz cream cheese with a few berries and one packet of truvia also good 
positive,7/7/21,i ordered three of these thru amazon prime no longer available as of my last order was oct and price was and now the price from outside vendor is around plus shipping that is over double the amazon price from last month i rate this product stars for being natural but one star for current price gouging it blends well and has a nice flavor i will not order again until amazon sells it

positive,18/6/21,this ends up being about half the price that i would pay at any store and it tastes exactly the same as the packets do not be fooled by people saying its cheaper at walmart because they are referring to the sizes walmart does not even carry these sizes not even online i bought of these containers and i recommend you do the same

positive,27/7/21,i like bob s red mill products and this four pack is a good price at least where i live the potato starch works well in gluten free recipes 
negative,13/7/21,i like the product but at nearly bucks per pack it is way overpriced i would buy it again if it was priced at about less i do like it for an afternoon boost but in the mornings i need full strength rocket fuel 
positive,13/9/21,i bought this a few weeks ago and really like this product this is my first time buying this product and i find that it easy to cook in a rice cooker and has a really nice chewy texture the flavor is nutty and good too if you like brown rice and or wild rice i think you will like this the only downside for me is the price i can buy a lb yes that is right bag of good white rice at an asian market for 
positive,7/9/21,i eat quite a bit of sushi and i have to say this sushi nori is up to par overall the flavor is fine and the quality is amazing for the price cannot do much better than this if you are trying to be conservative with what you spend on sushi

positive,15/1/21,the price is great and the teas are individually wrapped which is a plus since the exterior box of mine was torn and tapped in places have not tired them yet but the box says not to use them in more than cups of water 
positive,6/3/21,i started buying this brand of food when my dog had a litter of puppies i bought the puppy lover s bag i loved that it has wholesome ingredients and that meat is the first ingredient on the list look through the bags of dog foods at your grocer and you will see that meat is not first or second and then when you find it you will find it only contains meat by products my pets have had a healthy coat firm stools eating this brand of dog food and you cannot beat the price the added chelated minerals and natural preservatives create a holistic pet food i will continue to feed this to my dogs and recommend it to my friends as well 
positive,8/6/21,got this for my lab who is far from a fussy eater wanted to get her something healthy and not break the bank this seems to fit the bill comes in a lb bag so i do not have to reorder too often 
positive,7/1/21,i had my dog on petsmart s brand of food that is gluten free but it came in small bags and they charged an arm and a leg to ship a larger bag chicken soup got a great review from dog food review sites my dog eats it and seems to love it 
positive,17/4/21,this is the best product ever for making chili delicious simple and easy but this price is ridiculous we can get it for at walmart 
positive,10/3/21,i was able to save about by purchasing these through amazon as opposed to our local grocery store since we go through a box a week the savings can add up quickly would definitely recommend 
negative,14/1/21,this is for six pack boxes you can get these boxes for at target so this price is over more my bad for not checking the local price beforehand i will not make that mistake again 
negative,24/5/21,i will buy a new coffee maker before i will pay that much for the cup holder i think it is due to the availability of the product 
positive,14/10/21,we have this on automatic order with amazon to take advantage of the improved pricing we go through about ounce box per day and buying from amazon saves us a ton of money prime members so no shipping cost every once in a while we get a box that was beat up a little bit but not that big of a deal for the amount of money we save buying this stuff in bulk i am certain that should i ever feel like complaining to amazon about the shipping issue they would send me a replacement pronto that being said it is really no big deal 
negative,7/2/21,check around there is a very large markup on this product i like the idea of giving out animal cookies instead of so much surgery candy kids get too many sweets these days with corn syrup in everything 
positive,29/3/21,great tasting and a nice medium roast this coffee is a great deal for the price we really like the export also but for the price this is a winner

negative,10/7/21,this item is over priced i but the pack sunsweet one california prunes individually wraped for a bag carried at most walmarts if i buy i spend only i give the product rating a but your charge if definitely over prices gwen
positive,27/1/21,not the best canned mushrooms on earth but the price is good and they are definitely ok for tossing in a pot of spaghetti sauce or using as an extra ingredient in a soup or stir fry when there are no fresh mushrooms in the house just make sure that you rinse them thoroughly first as they have a slightly canned taste if they are not washed 
positive,1/6/21,local markets do not carry wild rice or charge about for ounces after searching the net this was the best deal i could find and it is a good high quality rice that cooks up great enjoy 
negative,20/8/21,unsaid in the description of this item is the fact that you receive only one box for the same item can be purchased directly from dreamfields for only which probably explains why this ad does not reveal the number of boxes in an order 
negative,14/8/21,love these little packs of raisinets hooray for portion control and when i saw them on amazon i thought it was a great deal boxes of packs of raisins i pay around for a pack at the grocery store so this seemed like a really good bargain boy was i wrong i did not get boxes of the packs i got one six pack which according to amazon has a retail price of bucks that is insane fortunately a quick chat with customer service refunded my purchase but i was still disappointed to find it was one pack and not 
positive,21/4/21,it is splenda and at a good price forget about the individual packets the cost will kill you if you use the product this is the way to buy it 
positive,1/4/21,it is getting harder and harder to find refills for pez this was a great deal 
positive,17/4/21,my husband wanted this gift for christmas but they were out of stock at books a million so i ordered it on amazon the following week i was shopping at target it and found the pez dispensers for cheaper 
positive,10/3/21,this is the second brand i have tried i was surprised that it smelled different it tastes great and works just the same as the other more expensive brand i will be ordering more if you have not ever tried using it as a moisturizer try it my skin can be oily in the summer but this is not heavy or greasy even in the summer and it works better than anything i have tried for winter dry chapped skin tastes great in everything from stir fry to cinnamon rolls too 
positive,22/4/21,much cheaper at costco much much much much much much a lot a lot a lot cheaper like bucks
positive,25/4/21,really pricey i think a gallon barrel is that much at the warehouse i first cancelled they did not respond so i went ahead and accepted certainly not economical 
negative,1/4/21,this is great candy smooth and flavorful with a great mouth as the tv chefs like to say however six bucks for ten pieces of hard candy the dollar store stocks this pretty regularly same brand same size one dollar 
negative,30/6/21,there is not a whole lot that is special about stride gum i kind of got annoyed chewing it all the time it does not really freshen your breath and you do not get the clean feeling of other gums it does not really last that long either so i was not too fond of it either way if your a fan of stride go for it 
positive,1/3/21,i had wanted to try this tea and the combination of teapot and tea was irrestible the tea is very good and the teapot is great when it is just myself sitting down and relaxing i have used the large bamboo container to set out guest tea selections in my home and the small container to carry tea with me camping i would also recomend this as a gift to someone special 
positive,29/1/21,this is really good price for loose leaf earl grey tea it smells wonderful and tastes great too the quality is definitely comparable with teavana and other more expensive loose leaf tea but only costs as much 
positive,17/4/21,comes in a plastic bag so you really need to have a container to put it in good flavor and a good value i bought for a gift and they like it very much 
positive,10/3/21,great price especially if you have amazon prime and sign up for the subscriptions you do not have to remember to pick up wet food and carry it home also the price here is the same price that i can get the cans at discount stores and on sale 
positive,30/5/21,it came right when it was supposed to well packaged nearly half the price i normally pay at retail stores 
positive,28/9/21,i have enjoyed big franks for years now that amazon carries them i can get them delivered to my door at a price including shipping subscription plan that is lower than i can find anywhere else 
positive,6/5/21,my husband uses all of these favors in his coffee drinks it is hard to pick a favorite because they all taste so rich and flavorful they are in plastic bottles wrapped up nice and sent quickly my husband scoffed when i originally bought this pack but once it arrived the next day love amazon he thought i was a genius with two vanillas regular and french hazelnut peppermint caramel and raspberry it is a great selection for a great price highly recommended 
positive,20/4/21,i love amazon i ordered this on tuesday for my weekend baking and we received it on thursday best price around and delivered right to the door easy peasy the can was a bit dented on the bottom but the contents were not affected 
positive,20/4/21,i like the product and bought because i was not able to find it here locally though i had previosly purchased it at costco charleston sc i should have looked more closely at the price because i was shocked i paid almost for three oz jars my fault but i will not be ordering any more on line 
positive,21/4/21,my dad loves this product the local stores sell one small box for an excess of for one box he eats this desert everyday now that we have enough it tastes just as good as the store bought product for a fraction of the cost great product 
positive,2/5/21,i switched to felidae canned cat food to help control the weight of my cats my vet says some cats do not metabolize the carbs of dry food well i started with science diet but that quickly broke the bank after months i am happy to report my cats have lost weight eating this cat food my dog gets canidae same brand as felidae all life stages dry kibble which i also recommend

positive,25/5/21,this item is way over priced check your local walmart and find it way cheaper the juice is great tasting with kids 
positive,22/5/21,pumpkin seeds are hard to find in the stores without an outrageous price this is a great deal 
positive,19/7/21,i was a bit skeptical at getting another brand than green mountain brands since grove square and san fran bay were really bad besides the original problem they had with the production on their first boxes brooklyn beans have been a great new find for us i could go through each blend but they are all similar to other gmcr brands the k cups seem a little lighter in weight and the lighter roasts did seem watery for the travel cup size but that is about the norm with all k cups the best thing i really like is the company actually responds and fixes any problems so stop complaining about the shipping when you are leaving feedback on the product i always get my shipments at least days ahead of scheduled date so do not be afraid to try these and save money subscribe and save another 
positive,7/9/21,love this coffee no problems brewing cannot beat the price realy good coffee and afordable customer service was top notch we raise our coffee cup to you
negative,25/8/21,the soup is delicious the price is not i purchased an pack of this soup for under twenty dollars delivered about months ago direct from amazon unfortunately it looks like we now have to go through a reseller to obtain this product and pay an inflated price hence the one star rating i am down to my last can but i cannot bring myself to pay this much for soup 
negative,6/9/21,this salt is way overpriced go to your local store and buy morton sea salt saltygator
positive,25/5/21,my dog is older and on several pills a day she just loves these pill pockets she swallows them whole and does not know that there is a pill hidden inside i loved buying them in bulk and geting a great price 
positive,7/9/21,i have two small dogs that both require medicating times a day this product is a life saver they stand at the counter and bark to remind me when it is time for their medicine the pill pockets are pricey but at amazon you can save a bundle compared to buying them at the vet s office if you opt for standard shipping plan on a good week s time for your order to arrive 
positive,13/10/21,thank you amazon for carrying amy s at such a reasonable price i paid about for this case when they were trying to charge me for it at my health food store these are the best refried beans i have ever had they taste even better since i add about a half a jar of salsa mild great value brand from walmart per can i love them because they do not taste like oil and they do not make me feel sick afterwards as other refried bean brands sometimes do i definitely recommend 
positive,2/10/21,i now will never run out of food for my cats they both love it every time and i love the price 
positive,23/9/21,this is an excellent product but unfortunately its not eligible for super saver shipping so the cost is too much per tart

positive,25/5/21,i have purchased these crackers in the supermarket for twice the price these were very fresh and arrived in days very good buy
negative,7/9/21,i was surprised when the catnip arrived to find it was only a one ounce tin the listing did not say how much was in the tin my fault i guess i just found the same size tin of this same catnip at a high end natural food store for only this is good stuff but overpriced and can probably be found locally for a lot less 
positive,15/7/21,we eat a box a week of these crackers so ordering in bulk from amazon helps us cut costs and they deliver it to us monthly through subscribe and save 
positive,3/6/21,if you can get past the fact that this does not arrive in any form of a package with the picture that is shown your good if you are looking for a great assortment of flavors that would be impossible to get all on your own then this is for you too i was very pleased with the assortment and how fun to go through and pick your flavor to try each time i purchased this for myself since my huband is more loyal to only one plain flavor k cup and i like variety 
positive,27/9/21,needed mimi moo s in a hurry and you delivered thank you our customers appreciate it we appreciate the low price 
positive,19/6/21,i like bob s red mill flours and the sorghum flour is great too the pack of is a great price at least where i live and it works well in creating the recipes from my gluten free cookbook 
negative,25/5/21, plus to ship that is almost for a box of cookies that costs about in the store is this guy smoking something are people buying these at this price these are a good cookie but in no way are they worth a box just another rip off there is even a much cheaper alternative right here on amazon keep looking you will find a much better deal than from this guy 
negative,7/9/21,i found these for much less at two other places here on amazon do not buy from here free shipping not worth it

positive,7/9/21,this is the cheapest price i could find for citric acid i use it to make detergent so i needed a big bag this was the right price good quality and it got here fast highly recommend 
positive,11/9/21,amazon does it again i use these noodles in a chicken soup recipe and i always get plenty of compliments on it the gnocchi is perfect and packaged wonderfully price cannot be beat either 
positive,13/7/21,the product is so versatile and flavorful i use it to make instant ginger tea also to cook asian style dishes or bake delicious cookies i trust frontier they always carry high quality products non irradiated and sulfur free 
positive,22/7/21,we have been buying this coffee every month for six month it has a nice mellow earthy flavor with low acidity considering i worked at starbucks for a few years i would say this is on par to their dark latin american blend the beans are always fresh 
positive,22/6/21,really enjoyed ordering and using this coffee reminds me of expresso in coffee shops throughout italy i have never really used pre packed coffee before as i have always preferred freshly ground however this taste fresh and yummy great head not bitter but still has good depth will continue to order every time i need more coffee 
positive,28/7/21,i like giving my son some prunes once in a while to get him regular the price for this pack is outstanding it came neatly packed to prevent damage i love earth s best baby food 
positive,13/10/21,i do not think you can beat the value of this coffee especially with the subscribe and save program it is also a great french roast with a full deep flavor it does not taste burnt like some of the starbucks varieties but is smooth and a little smokey i like strong coffee and so this is definitely the way to go for me i have had compliments from visitors to our house on how good the coffee is as well i am completely satisfied 
positive,19/2/21,i had read earlier that the colombian coffee by eight of clock was judged to be the best brand for flavor and taste i purchased the larger bags as they were a good buy for the price i feel like a winner twice and have a great cup of coffee each morning too 
negative,14/12/20,i got a box of this tea from a bed and bath and beyond kind of store and really liked it so i came here to buy more expecting a good price on a larger box a cup and a k cup is not even an oz cup nuts you can get a box of from a certain b wholesale j warehouse club for cents each the tea was surprising good for not really brewing but buy it elsewhere cheaper 
positive,14/12/20,there was a lot of food in a small package here which was a pleasant surprise honestly now as a disclaimer i should mention i have eaten more than my bodyweight in mres so my standards for edible and delicious in long term storage food might be a bit low but i actually really dug this the salmon spread was zippy and spicy without being too much and just enough for the crackers the edamame are darker looking than you see in the boxart and do have a bit of a beany aftertaste i wish there was a bit less of those and way more of that fruit mix unlike regular dried fruit this had a nice gingery seasoning that made it really outstanding i could eat just that and be a happy little camper and the chocolate square is nummy d the downsides as others have mentioned is that for that price you can probably go get something fresh cooked to eat and there is a good bit of waste each individual plastic wrapper and the box itself the plus sides are that it is portable it is tasty and it is quite handy will i buy it again i think so honestly sometimes i do not have time the night before to pack up a healthy lunch from home and in that case this would be a great way to stave off the temptation of the dreaded vending machine or the temptation to call out for pizza not an every day item for me but as an occasional treat definitely 
positive,19/2/21,i was super excited to find this online for a better price than my grocery store i have never used spelt flour before but i made cookies with it and i liked them 
positive,10/1/21,i was getting these for my pitbull mix from walmart for around it takes him about days to consume one and i have not had problems with big pieces choking him like i do with other chews i only wish they were sold by the case 
negative,26/3/21,i know that you are taking a chance after all they are flops but i think they are are overpriced 
negative,24/3/21,i have written to this company to try to get an answer as to why i was overcharged for this coffee i do not recommend buying this product until liquid nation is not allowed to sell it 
positive,24/2/21,if you love couscous but hate paying the price of the leading brand give this one a try i received my sampler set the other day and my family has been enjoying it ever since you can add your own flavoring chicken broth garlic or just salt and butter this is a very good value and perfect to stock up your pantry with 
negative,19/2/21,this new packaging is more expensive than the last plus it is smaller oz vs the in the old packaging granted it is nice not having to fish around for the scooper but there is no reason to increase pricing on this target had the oz for at one point maybe try to clear old packaging for new now it is at still cheaper than what i have seen online even for amazon so far 
positive,14/12/20,my daughter teaches kindergarten and i help her and the other kindergarten kids do gingerbread houses at xmas every year we have to buy the small tubes since m m do does not sell the bags locally these bags are much cheaper and we will have left overs for other projects 
positive,19/10/21,these pretzels are almost addictive they are so good at for the pack they are a bargain as well beating the local grocery stores 
negative,18/5/21,too much of a good thing we worked this kibble in over time slowly shifting the percentage of felidae to national junk food brand until the bowl was all natural by this time the cats could not keep it in or down what a mess we have moved on 
negative,19/2/21,this candy is not as described the middle is almost hard it is not a silky or smooth filling as described looks and tastes like it is way past it is expiration date would never reccommend this paid a good chunk of cash for nothing
negative,18/5/21,i have been drinking this tea for the past or years usually buying a box or two when visiting large metropolitan areas where many middle eastern stores carry loose ahmad teas usually at for a pound box i have always considered it an unremarkable but robust tea with enough aroma and taste and beautiful reddish color perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own but a decent base for mixes this tea however is nothing of the sort freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell and the brewed tea is weak flat and tasteless somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore so you get a lot of tea for the money but the quality is such that you might as well drink lipton bags they are not that much worse 
negative,18/6/21,five minutes in one tentacle was bitten off ball inside cracked in half not durable enough to be a dog toy disappointed so is the dog 
negative,7/7/21,i felt energized within five minutes but it lasted for about minutes i paid for this drink i could have just drunk a cup of coffee and saved my money 
negative,18/6/21,yes it is probably healthier than hour energy or starbucks shots but if you are looking to avoid a caffeine overload this is still not for you most energy drinks cannot be made w out a high dosage of caffeine i believe the caffeine content of guayaki shot is ml probably lower than other un healthy energy shot drinks but i believe most other people avoid the top brands b c they contain too much caffeine and or sugar if you do not react well to caffeine guayaki is not a good buy either i definitely feel an energy boost w full guayaki shot but not w out all the other caffeine side effects irritability nervousness mood swings caffeine overdose is why i stopped drinking coffee but it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe now you are not sensitive to caffeine then it is a great buy it is not loaded w sugar the taste is easy and pleasant it is not loaded w a bunch of chemicals like hour shots or starbucks drinks and the energy boost lasts for about to hours takes about to minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body weight side note if you want to feel energized during the day have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy 
negative,7/7/21,i so wish i would have read this review before purchasing two gallons of this oil for my health issues it reeks like a chemical rubber smell this smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid when i called to report the situation to the company sabrina told me i would have to pay to send them a sample to have tested by a lab unbelievable good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund including shipping the product is faulty period i will never order anything from this company again and do not recommend it to anyone based on this horrible customer service and lack of responsibility and ownership 
negative,1/7/21,this product has a strong after taste of crayola crayons i am in the process of trying different brands of coconut oils for cooking purposes upon opening the plastic container the aroma of crayons immediately fills the room and this flavor permeates the food that is cooked in it i suspect the source of the problem is the plastic used in the plastic container as i have not experienced this with any of the other brands purchased to date my favorite coconut oil is distributed by barleans the flavor is fantastic however they do not supply a gallon sized tub and dr mercola has the best product in that size category 
negative,7/7/21,i used to buy this sugar for years i do not eat much sugar but still this sugar is called turbinado sugar but is misleading i picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar and other brands in the local food store that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something how did i find out i needed just a sweet water few days ago i put this sugar in the raw in the glass the water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just pure white sugar crystals what a shame on the producer you can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well i am just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice 
negative,23/7/21,this is the first time i have really been misled by other reviews on amazon i like hr energy i find rain ok and so i thought i would try this product based on the reviews boy am i sorry i gagged getting one bottle down even with my nose pinched really and it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards tic tacs at once did not get rid of it but worst of all within an hour i was yawning and drowsy unless you really like things that taste of a weird tea flavored cough syrup and do not work do not buy this i do not know what to do with the other bottles big fail
negative,20/7/21,the package came with the label torn off and no cooking instructions i know how i normally cook couscous so tried cup water to cup couscous brought to a boil and let sit covered for it was mushy and tasteless we have thrown out the rest of the container 
negative,19/7/21,so we cancelled the order it was cancelled without any problem that is a positive note 
negative,18/6/21,i received the items in a timely manner upon receipt i removed a pack to consume the pop tart was stale and left an awful taste in my mouth 
negative,7/7/21,serveice delivery with the seller was excellent the product was not will not order again bad taste iam not sure if it was old or that how it tastes i throw it right away i coudl not drink it 
negative,27/6/21,a very bitter tasting coffee even when enhanced with cream and or honey definately not my cup of coffee oh did i say it was bitter 
negative,21/7/21,this mix is very poorly packaged and breaks open easily during shipping nearly a full bag of my order was spilled in the shipping box bags out of had come unsealed at the top there were no tears in the packages 
negative,18/6/21,i like kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked i bought a bigger sized bag from costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly so i do not know why these were different will never buy these chips from here again 
negative,7/7/21,i really love kettle brand chips but these are rather disappointing there is very little sour cream or onion flavor 
negative,30/6/21,i agree with the other review these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums the chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt vinegar combo unfortunately every bag i received in that case was over cooked they were very dark and only a few golden brown chips in each bag they definitely need to improve that 
negative,1/7/21,i was really looking forward to trying these chips since i love cheese but i was super disappointed i am a big fan of kettle chips but these tasted somewhat stale and almost plain they are supposed to have a cheddar taste but you cannot taste any of that it is annoying i do not recommend this flavor salt and vinegar and buffalo bleu are my favorite 
negative,24/8/21,these are perhaps the worst chips that have ever gone into my mouth for my entire life sour cream onion and in this case chive chips were my favorite recently kettle brand honey dijon mustard took that slot so when i found out they had sour cream onion i just had to try them as soon as i opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk and indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful it tastes like rancid milk not just sour but like sour cream that when rancid the powdery texture is also extremely unappealing i basically hated these chips i would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery chalky texture on a chip with a rancid and onion flavor and i have a hard time believing that person exists i plan on contacting kettle and sharing my thoughts with them hopefully they will reassess the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips 
negative,21/7/21,kettle chips now look feel and taste like lays these chips used to be my favorite when it was crinkle cut and hefty now no longer my favorite 
negative,25/6/21,these were nasty they were so greasy and too rich for my blood plus they lacked major flavor no spicy jalapeno flavor at all i was so dissapointed in these chips i am always hearing great things about these chips but i am telling you yuck yuck yuck give me pain chips any day maybe there is a better kettle chip brand out there but i am staying clear from these chips i wish i could give these zero stars if i could 
negative,13/9/21,being a salt free product is why i purchased this but the chips are quite greasy 
negative,18/6/21,when originally produced in england these we are the best chips i had ever tasted but unfortunately since they were bought out by the us conglomerate they now taste plain nasty hard rather than crispy are much thinner than they used to be and lacking any flavour a real shame 
negative,7/7/21,after opening numerous bags i found that none of the chips had any flavoring on them completely plain and gross how does this even happen 
negative,15/7/21,i have bought these at the local supermarket and enjoyed them although they are so salty that a few leave my tongue and roof of my mouth burning keeps you from eating too many occasionally i get really stale items from amazon com and this was one unedible beware of the quality of food items on this website that are on special as they can be very close to due dates or in this case not expired but stale and unedible just the same 
negative,11/7/21,i ordered kettle chips in the following flavvors salt fresh ground pepper tuscan cheese n y cheddar and hers they all tasted the same to me if there is a variety pack suggest you order before ordering large size i wish i could return the unopened bags 
negative,7/10/21,i purchased these because of the low salt and they were indeed low in salt however many many of the chips in the bag were literally dripping in oil i have never encountered this problem with other potato chip brands it was very unappetizing and who wants all that oil i will never buy these again and i would not recommend them to others 
negative,6/7/21,if you are looking for strong s v flavor these definitely are not for you very mild in comparison to many others i live in tx and i can tell you i have tried all s v chips i can get ahold of the best of the best are heb storebrand and world market bob s and zapp s are not bad from a chip standpoint they have typically great kettle crunch but if you are looking for s v flavor these have just a touch 
negative,18/6/21,i do not know if it was the case of chips we received or what but everyone we allowed to sample the chips in a buffet style setting agreed that these were slightly on the salty side one person jokingly stated that these would be terrific for melting ice and snow due to the amount of salt in these we had ordered these with the expectations that these would be similar to the lay s kettle mesquite potato chips but these kettle brands outback bbq chips are the exact opposite sorry folks we just had better expectations from these chips but they a little on the on the salty side we are still looking forward to amazon finally getting the lay s kettle mesquite potato chips in stock these got a star because the bbq powder they had used on these were flavorful enough to be unique 
negative,7/7/21,these chips are greasy and taste burnt there is grease in the bottom of the bag and the chips are saturated with it especially at the bottom of the bag even if they are trans fat free they need to be a lot less greasy 
negative,27/7/21,do not waste your money on any of the kettle brand potato chips i bought a case of these and a case of the cheddar and sour cream both cases ended up in the garbage can 
negative,13/7/21,used to eat the spicy thai flavor all the time message makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was message free now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage a bunch more salt and message stuffed in under the label yeast extract they removed the no message from the label so they know very well what they did the worst part though is that they taste horrible instead of crisp oily and full of character say as if they were cooked in like a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays the spicy thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid what a shame no more kettle chips for me it seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method do not be fooled into paying a premium price for these chips as they are not a premium product anymore 
negative,13/9/21,terrible i cannot believe this i received this item and every single bag was opened but i am stationed in afghanistan and this was going to be a snack for my team while going out on missions i was so embarrassed when the bags were opened and spilt out all in the box gross and the box is filled with grease stains i do not know if it was from the airplane ride all the way here but the box should have been more insulated and bubble wrap should have been used instead of paper i am very unhappy with stale crusty chips out the bag and us soldiers cannot enjoy now 
negative,7/9/21,kettle branch potato chips new york cheddar these are good if you like kettle fried potato chips that are waaaay salty on the burnt side and taste rancid either because the cheese flavoring or the oil it was fried in was already old i want to like this brand of chips and try their new and other flavors every now and then but after having tried all sorts of other brands of kettle cooked chips these just do not hit the spot for me 
negative,17/4/21,for those of you who like me had to order the kettle spicy thai chips from amazon because they are so hard to find locally you will probably be aggrieved to know that the recipe has changed they are just like regular potatoe chips i paid for them but now my husband gets to eat them because he did not like the spicy thai but these are fine for him yuck 
negative,10/3/21,while i admit that the oversalted chip is addictive i really think this one has gone too far skin literally peeled off my lips and inside my mouth after eating these i am surprised that they are still on the market 
negative,17/4/21,there is nothing too good or too bad about these chips if you like plain potato chips you would like these they are thicker than most brands fresh out of box very crunchy and not too salty for me one bag has a lot i generally cannot finish it by myself part of the reason is that they are too oily some chips almost look transparent if you know what i mean the taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me if you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice except salt as the name says i do not think i will buy these again the best by date on my bags are march and i ordered them at the end of october 
negative,21/1/21,the spicy thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market however kettle foods has changed the ingredients used with ginger being the most important that is now missing notice that they removed ginger with attitude from the bag sadly the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me they are not that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non existent here are the original and new ingredient listings original ingredients select potatoes safflower and or sunflower oil honey powder evaporated cane syrup honey salt garlic powder jalapeno pepper ground ginger onion powder habanero pepper dried parsley citric acid cilantro extract ginger oil cayenne pepper white pepper lime oil new ingredients potatoes safflower and or sunflower oil sugar dried cane syrup salt maltodextrin yeast extract spices garlic powder onion powder dried parsley jalapeno powder citric acid natural flavors lime extract i am assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner blue diamond they might want to get rid of great taste naturally from their bags as i do not consider maltodextrin to be very natural great job kettle way to ruin a great thing 
negative,30/1/21,i was sent week past fresh by date stock chips are noticeably not fresh in taste will not order again edit and just to add to the dangers of expired stock one of the bags had a rat hole in it black marks on inside of hole very obviously rat unfortunately i put a chip in my mouth before i saw the hole very bad form amazon 
negative,13/2/21,and that is the problem i order these by the case of and when they are good which is over half the time they are the best kettle chip the best and then i get a case of the worse the potatos are mealy and old so i just throw them out and order again expensive but when they are made with good fresh potatos they are the best the last case is what prompted me to write this the potatos were weird like they were almost sour as in going bad and i even wrote the company that makes them so if you want the best kettle chip there is try these and if the ones you get are not the best try again i myself am done ordering because it is creeping me out that they are using soured potatos and either not noticing or not caring 
negative,15/1/21,i am very disappointed with this product because i could not see how many calories it has at the time i ordered it i received it and now i can see it has calories per tablespoon granulated sugar has only calories per tablespoon how could agave nectar be better than sugar 
negative,6/3/21,i was so excited thinking they had my favorite discontinued kettle flavor but was disappointed when i opened the box and found this substitution i am keeping them but would not have ordered bags of this flavor it is a very good bbq chip but i could get this flavor at the grocery store why oh why do my favorite food items always get discontinued the one star is for the substitution the country bbq is a start chip but not the chip i longed for 
negative,8/6/21,i guess there is no telling what will tickle the palate i am a huge tabasco fan and i love unconventional snacks but these do not taste to me even remotely like the wonderful sauce they are made from i did not find them to have much of a kick at all practically bland in fact even with my strong aversion to wasting food i had to throw out or give away most of the case do yourself a favor and find a bag of these locally before taking a chance on 
negative,7/1/21, yeast extract is listed as an ingredient sounds harmless right specifically these chips contain autolyzed yeast extract which is on a chemical level monosodium glutamate it is just derived from a different source but it has all the same toxic properties kettle still advertises their products as containing no message while they acknowledge that their chips are not safe for people with message sensitivities 
negative,17/4/21,i did not like these potatoe chips it is hot and sweet with an overwhelming taste of garlic it is also a bit salty 
negative,10/3/21,unfortunately having ordered quite a few of these previously i neglected to not look for the word supreme in this offer and since i was then receiving free shipping had delivered we that is my husband guests and me knew immediately that these were different from those previously enjoyed but currently amazon featured the supreme babka and now i am awaiting to receive these in the future i will read more carefully 
negative,14/1/21,i opened the can and immediately became concerned when i saw what looked like dried white crust rather than fluffy frosting the package recommended stirring before use so i gave that a try and under the crust was an indescribable gelatinous goo the best i can equate it to is a white version of the blue goop the mother serves for dinner in better of dead no raisins in it though i tried to stir it together and the end result was gelatinous goo with white crusties in it when lifting the knife to spread it long strings on goo trailed from my knife i opted for making my own frosting instead very easy a little sprectrum palm shortening a lot of powdered sugar a tiny splash of vanilla a tiny bit of salt and rice milk as needed for consistency beat for minutes and i had the fluffy butter cream frosting i thought i would get from cherrybrook i wonder if our can was overheated in the store whole foods or something i have read positive reviews of their frosting mix so maybe i will try that next time 
negative,24/5/21,i love cherrybrook kitchen and have tried almost all of their products i was excited to try the ready to spread frosting as i do not usually keep the needed ingredients on hand for their box frosting i am not a picky eater especially if the item contains sugar but this was horrible the consistency is absolutely nothing like regular canned frosting it is not light and fluffy it is very gooey i cannot even imagine trying to spread it on a cake it would rip it to pieces because it is so thick and gooey i did not even try it on a cake because the taste and texture were so off putting seriously do not waste your money 
negative,14/10/21,this product was such a disappointment as all the other reviewers said it is a gluey sticky texture more akin to elmer s glue than to an edible food product the flavor was sickening sweet i actually thought that the frosting had spoiled it was that bad save yourself the time and i paid and make your own frosting or go with another brand cherrybrook cake and cookie mixes are so good it is hard to believe they even sell this 
negative,7/2/21,i am glad i found this on the reduced rack for the taste was not bad but no way i could frost my cake it stuck to the knife ran down in strings what a mess i too thought i had gotten a bad batch my gds birthday cake looks like crap who would buy this mess horrible
negative,29/3/21,i recently purchased this on sale at my local grocery store now i know why it was on sale this is not a fluffy creamy white frosting you would expect to find when opening the jar now i was not expecting it to be just like betty crocker but it was pretty bad like others said it is a gluey tacky mess that would completely ruin a cake if you tried to spread it on it reminds me of taffy that has not quite hit the right stage in the candy making process the taste is not that great either and it is sickeningly sweet even for frosting the only thing it might be used for is a frosting for cinnamon buns i still do not think it would be the right consistency 
negative,17/4/21,i can honestly say this is the worst frosting we have ever bought it is kind of generous to call it frosting it has more the consistency of rubber cement and since we were in a time crunch we did not have the luxury of going back out to the store for a different frosting so we forged ahead and decorated a cake with it horrible experience bad enough to put us off cake decorating forever it spread about as easily as chewing gum stuck to everything it came in contact with and got crumbs of the cake mixed up in it on top of all this it did not even taste good by the time we were done decorating we knew there was no way we could feed this mess to our family so we ended up going to the store anyway to buy a pre made cake our cake which took twice as long to decorate because this stuff is so gooey was used as a centerpiece a really ugly centerpiece that cracked and peeled as the frosting dried 
negative,10/3/21,my husband and i were very disappointed in this coffee very weak watery cup of coffee a definite waste of 
negative,10/7/21,this item werther s sugar free hard candy if consumed will give you or your friends loose bowels i purchased bags and discovered more than a bowel problem you cannot return them need a laxative i have ten unopened bags you can have for free 
negative,27/1/21,this kind of tea not good taste and smell so wear it is not like tea and feel like some thing chemical 
negative,1/6/21,the laddoos turned bad in a few days after we received it no other item inside our fridge turned bad 
negative,20/8/21,this is not disco dust which is edible and made for baking do not purchase this product for such purposes 
negative,14/8/21,this is not as easy as it looks does not came with enough yellow frosting and the frosting does not stick very well my year old did like making it though 
negative,21/4/21,i am a preschool teacher and do a g is for gingerbread unit every january i was on vacation during christmas and when i got back not a gingerbread kit was to be found which is odd i needed one for my preschool class and needed it in less then a week i looked everywhere and could not find ont so i had one overnighted from amazon on nye and it came yesterday i pick this one because of the rudolph theme the gingerbread itself came broken like unable to use would need a glue gun to get it to work broken it is non returnable i called amazon they were nice enough to order me a second one since i spend a ton of money each year with them this one also came broken i order a lot from amazon and things do not come broken i think only one time have i had returned something because it was broken in s of orders but two of the same thing in a row i think it is the kit itself and nothing to do with how it was shipped i will say most come ups and overnight comes fed ed but it is bubble wrapped very well i think the gingerbread is not good and cracks in shipping and breaks off the rest of the kit is very cute the first kit the candies had spilled out and where a mess in the box but the second kit while the gingerbread was all broken up again the candies were all in their bags too bad but i would try something else stay away from this one 
negative,1/4/21,the whole idea of a spongebob ginger bread pineapple is really great but the sticker that says use by has a jn date on it if that is this is not good i think it would be fun to make and a cute decoration but my son is going to want to eat it the least the seller could do is to check the expiration date its right on the front of the box not happy at all 
negative,17/4/21,this tea carries the flavor one would expect from the smell terrible it invigorates like a puncture wound and the only revival is that after drinking you discover that you are still alive well one tea bag was enough for me my mother in law said oh that smells kind of like wine okay kind of like wine with a hint of rot and a moldy aftertaste if she likes it she can have the whole box 
negative,10/3/21,if it were possible to give this product zero stars i would have done so i am a huge fan of twinings teas and was very excited to try this new blend after arriving home from the grocery i immediately started the kettle to enjoy a cup while prepping dinner between sorting washing and chopping items the hot water was added to the bag to steep preparation continued until a distinctly off odor hit me i thought one of my ingredients must be rancid i hunted around for almost four minutes before i realized it was the tea even after cleaning up and airing out the kitchen my roommate later came in and asked about the smell save your money to purchase any other twinings product 
negative,22/4/21,cadbury chocolate uses a different formula in each country it is manufactured new zealand is uses more cream than australia etc this version by hershey is not what you expect from england australia or new zealand cadbury it does not melt on your tongue like those countries so it tastes differently if you are looking for the silky smooth easy melting chocolate find the non hershey version hershey has missed an opportunity to introduce high quality cadbury chocolate to usa 
negative,25/4/21,the individual pocky sticks are not separately packaged and melt and stick together while being shipped 
negative,1/4/21,this product must qualify for some sort of deceptive packaging award the box only contains bars and the wrappers are smaller than normal so at least of the interior of the box is air then when you unwrap the bar you find they are only about the length of a normal snack bar the rest of it is empty air inside the wrapper if they were to not include wrappers those bars would occupy less than of the space inside the box as far as taste goes they are so so on the dry side with a hint of berry flavor celiacs who are used to inferior products will not be disappointed in the taste of this one i have also had their cookies and they suffer from the same sort of deceptive packaging the picture on the side of the box shows what most of us would consider a normal sized cookie but when you open the box you find that it mostly contains a plastic tray holding cookies about the size of a quarter i really want to like this company they seem to be trying hard and coming out with new products and keeping allergens out of the production process that is why i have continued to try their products i bought their granola many times always wanting to like it but it is some of the worst food i have ever had the clusters are hard as the partially popped kernels at the bottom of your bag of popcorn and more fitting for gerbils than people all in all i would not recommend enjoy life foods 
negative,30/6/21,i have recently stopped eating a number of allergens dairy soy nuts and these were one of the few snacks which fit into my dietary restrictions unfortunately these were pretty gross miserable texture and more cardboard flavored than berry i threw them away i would recommend the cocoa ones as they are much tastier and also allergen free 
negative,1/3/21,my daughter had extensive food allergies as an infant toddler and we bought these bars consistently she still has the nut and egg allergy so i like that i can trust the manufacturer and know the food is safe unfortnately the last few times we have purchased the bars all varieties they have been hard as a rock and my daughter will not eat them i have tried them myself and thought i might break a tooth i had them on subscribe and save which i have now cancelled and have several boxes which no one in my family will eat i agree with a previous post i want to love these bars and i love everything the company stands for and actually really like their cookies but something has changed with these bars and they are just not even appetizing i hope they address the issue and i will certainly try them again if they do something to enhance the taste and address the issue with the texture a total bummer they were better in the past but something changed with the taste along with their new packaging 
negative,29/1/21,refer to the picture i posted above the bar is half the size you think it is going to be it is literally a two bite bar very deceptive advertising that and the fact that they are ridiculously expensive is the reason for the one star my year old son ate one and did not like them i ate one and agreed as did my husband could not give it away everyone has different tastes but these are no tasty treat as far as i am concerned 
negative,17/4/21,imagine taking some kids playground chalk perhaps that tan colored one and grinding it into powder with plenty of chunks then scoop it up and put it in your mouth that is how disgusting this bar is i have no idea how and who is rating this as flavorful it has none i have done nutritional coaching for years and watched healthy foods progress from painfully bad to barely edible to excellent this neanderthal era gluten free bar is so bad i want to go to my local grocery store take all the boxes off off the shelf and hide them in a different part of the store perhaps if there is a trash compactor just to protect people from the experience my daughter had with this product save your money for these ridiculously expensive and spend it on anything else enjoy life bars being ill is better than putting this garbage in your mouth 
negative,10/3/21,the first ball worked pretty well it just looked a little beaten up since then half of these have fallen to pieces in hot water all of them do after sitting for a bit if you do not mind the rate of failure the tea itself is pretty good and fairly tolerant of being steeped for a long time especially considering that it is white tea 
negative,30/5/21,wow i am shocked to find clear plastic pieces in the jars the other posters say they notified earth s best about this in august and they are still selling it without checking or recalling no more earth s best for my little guy i am taking my business elsewhere and i am very sad that organic company is selling baby food with plastic and bpa in their jars they got to do better than this to get my business 
negative,28/9/21,i normally love earth s best products as does my son however tonight after i would given him half the jar i thought i would try some since it was a new flavor and i realized that there were little pieces or soft shredded plastic in it i was appalled as this is my first child and i do not have any experience with this kind of thing i called poison control they said he would be ok and once i knew he was fine i got really angry i looked it up online and found that earth s best has actually known about the plastic for some time but are still selling it do not buy earth s best really disappointing 
negative,6/5/21,only three jars came in a form edible to babies the rest of them were filled will a clump of spongy mush that would not mix with the water it also had a brown color and not the yellowish brown like the jars that had the good mixture pretty disappointing and a waste of money 
negative,20/4/21,to be fair only one of my twins got gas from this but it was horrible up all night screaming from gas pains garbanzo beans are not an ideal food for young babies 
negative,20/4/21,i usually make my baby s food it is so easy steam fruits veggies and puree but sometimes i do not have enough time to cook and i buy earth s best baby foods baby likes all the fruits and veggies so far but did not like this one she refused to eat it when i tried it i understood why i would not eat it myself either it tastes nasty my poor baby immediately i made her a homemade potato zucchini asparagus puree and she loved it i would not recommend this flavor 
negative,21/4/21,this is my daughter s most favorite baby food by far this is the only ones she will eat and rarely will eat the other kinds however the taste is very bland for me as an adult at least after you put the unfinished portion in the fridge it may become sort of watery at which point i throw it out it is unique from the others in the combination of vegetables it has especially zucchini i had to update my review today because i saw little pieces of thin stretchy plastic in two jars of this baby food plastic in baby food i notified earth s best about it and will be sending them these pieces of plastic for testing but i am not giving my baby this food any more even though she likes it that is it for us 
negative,2/5/21,i just wanted to post here that i found small bits of plastic in this food as i was feeding my month old plastic in food baby food so please be careful if you buy this or are considering it my daughter loves this food it is actually her favorite this is the first time we have noticed plastic in it in over months 
negative,25/5/21,i do not know whether it was a fault in the packaging or if they were just past their prime but they were rock hard and the flavor was not strong enough 
negative,7/9/21,this was a disappointment i use other products from this line manufacturer on a regular basis i bought this item as a convenience to carry liquid stevia in my purse the first time i went to use it the liquid was a dark color almost black and i had to throw out the latte i was trying to sweeten all the manufacturer s other liquid products are clear and in fact this is titled clear liquid it must have been outdated spoiled i had already thrown the packing out so do not know how it was dated i tried calling the amazon supplier but the call rolled into voice mail it is not enough money to spend time following up but it was disappointing 
negative,25/5/21,i ordered these lollipops for a friends wizard of oz themed shower the arrived packaged well but i noticed the box said they are from oriental trading company if i wanted a cheap product that i knew was low quality and from china then i would have bought them directly from their site at for of them however from the picture these looked well made the picture is very deceiving and so is the description they show same colored lollipops mine came in a variety of colors they also gave dimentions that the lollipops were i noticed they looked a bit small and when i measured they did not even come to long not any of them even though they are all differnet lengths this was very disappointing since i planned to stand them up in a vase of lemon drops overall i am very disappointed in this product and the seller for not being honest about the product they are providing to consumers 
negative,22/5/21,i purchased these to give to children who come to my place of business when they arrived it says clearly on the back of the individual wrapper made in china no way i am giving these to children if they were manufactured in china following the whole poisoned pet food debacle the fact that these are made in china needs to be highlighted much more clearly 
negative,19/7/21,i purchased these for my candy buffet at my wedding and i am not impressed at all i could have saved money by ordering them directly from oriental trading company which is clearly where they came from they look cheap and they are not as colorful as shown in the picture the oriental trading company information is on the back of the wrappers on the lollipops most of the lollipop sticks are bent and two lollipops arrived broken the box only has lollipops but in the description it says there is i would have expected that if i knew they were coming from oriental trading company but that is not in the description so i feel ripped off 
negative,7/9/21,these lollipops are not as pictured they came in assorted colors some really drab not the rainbow brights shown in the picture they are also completely flat rather than being the rolled old fashioned candy style so they look cheap i need them for a birthday party and i was really disappointed when i received them 
negative,25/8/21,i opened this product to find that the lollipops were all broke i was very disappointed they did not package this product in a way that would help keep it from breaking you are better off buying them from a store around your area 
negative,6/9/21,not happy with the product once they were cooked the potatoes were flat and did not look any thing like the product picture that was seen the shipping cost as much as the potatoes did 
negative,25/5/21,loose prickly pear tea makes a great iced tea but it is very difficult to find in pure form this tea is black tea with prickly pear flavor the shipping cost is twice the cost of the tea if there is a prickly pear component it is all but undetectable when i drink it it just tastes like regular black tea very disappointing 
negative,7/9/21,so disappointed with this frosting the first time i used this frosting i was disappointed but a year has gone by and i thought that maybe i had gotten a bad container i really should have thought twice about buying it again but i wanted to give pillsbury the benefit of the doubt boy was i wrong in doing that both times that i used it the frosting pretty much sagged off of the cake my cakes were definitely cooled i had even put the latest one in the freezer to slice into layers after thawing it in the fridge i began to ice it sure enough after putting the frosting on it just started to slide off of the cake again this product needs to either be marketed as cupcake frosting the recipe needs tweaked or it needs to be pulled off of the shelves all together shame on me for trying it a second time 
negative,13/10/21,i remember well the beer nuts i used to savor those were the days of the big redskin type peanut surrounded with a glaze of honey sweetness punctuated with a salty tang i remember so well these nuts i now have in the palm of my hand are not reminiscent of beer nuts in any way yes there is a discernible salty taste but the sweetness is more to me imagined than real plus these nuts are simply the common inexpensive spanish peanuts in short i would just ask beer nuts what happened 
negative,2/10/21,the flavor of the old beer nuts is almost entirely gone the beer nuts are now just plain spanish peanuts with a slight flavor hardly noticeable extremely disappointing 
negative,23/9/21,it is not the best way to buy beer nuts perhaps the product had been exposed to high heat and a whole lot of shaking most of the coating and flavoring was off of the nuts even though the individual cans are sealed it is like the nuts had been sitting out in a bowl for a long time on a hot humid day 
negative,26/6/21,the current product certified organic raw cacao powder from ecuador sold by saaqin is of terrible quality somehow reviews for a similar item produced by alive and aware were associated with this product the cocoa i received when ordering through this page is made by organic herbal essence alive and aware is delicious organic herbal essence is not another warning after receiving the bag of organic herbal essence and hating it i ordered alive and aware certified organic raw cacao powder from ecuador pounds shipped by halaleveryday i thought for sure i would get alive and aware given it is in the product title but halaleveryday actually shipped me organic herbal essence grr 
negative,25/5/21,as another reviewer stated many of the reviews for this product are actually for a different raw cacao powder from alive and aware ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder that is what i ordered about months ago and it was awesome i am almost out and when i went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product from saquin which is not what i ordered and it is more expensive the same base price but i got it with free shipping not bucks so that is a big price increase i know it was still from alive and aware mid february but recently something changed i am really confused irritated how my review for alive and aware raw cacao got switched to a different brand from a different seller i mean cannot they just say out of stock or currently unavailable like they do with other stuff why would they switch reviews around seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one especially since as the other reviewer stated they are not comparable and this stuff from saquin is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware also the price increase is pretty shocking i guess it is the market and raw cacao is in higher demand too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao i did recently order alive and aware s raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those they are as the description states from alive and aware not another brand frankly i am beginning to wonder about some of the brands and vendors that ship from amazon i know they have warehouses in different parts of the country but it is a little suspicious and i just wish there was more transparency about what comes from amazon and what comes from a different company seems like halal everyday alive and aware etc are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday saquin are these really different companies under the auspices of amazon or is it amazon by a different name only like the other reviewer said he ordered something that said alive and aware in the description and when it came it was from saquin halal everyday who knows i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon for now i am going to seek out another source not through amazon that stands behind their cacao it is very important to me for health benefits and the ecological social impacts of where it is harvested to know that i am getting top notch certified organic raw cacao if amazon is going to be so wishy washy and sneaky i am going elsewhere wagging finger at amazon i think for now i will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back heavens to besty this stuff rocks it is such a good value too maybe the best out there as i have def shopped around i have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder and this is certainly top notch kudos to alive and aware for offering it at such a reasonable price i am not a raw foodie per say but i try to follow a neo paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao properly prepared with just enough natural sweetener i think this is a truly guilt free pleasure it is loaded with antioxidants as you probably know so go ahead get the big bag you can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food of the gods theobroma as they say my favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa i just whisk it into gently heated fresh raw whole milk or cream so it is not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible i know it is not raw but hey this is how i love it add just enough sweetener i like sorghum molasses a scant t spoon a bit of maca powder a dash of real salt and after that is thoroughly whisked i top it off with a spoonful of evo coconut oil yumm i have converted everyone even the kids i babysit who used to prefer swiss miss or i make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk lightly sweetened you better believe it goes fast i love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins a d and the x factor read weston a price and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry i am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy also process it with evo coconut oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil i often toss in soaked dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars just process in batches so it is kind of homogenous like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw go for it buy this huge bag share the goodness and you will be healthier and happier for it i guarantee peace be with you 
negative,7/9/21,ya know when you are on a gluten free diet you yearn for those forbidden treats like licorice and malted milk realizing that true licorice on this challenging diet is in the past and not likely to ever be repeated in the near future we need to alter our expectations for this treat i had tried this company s raspberry laces and strawberry laces pretty good although not easy to chew think bubblegum not real licorice you understand but pretty doggone good as an alternative so i thought i try these too how bad could they be i found them pleasant to chew not tough at all but the taste nasty and medicinal cough syrup with an aftertaste that is truly awful so i am stuck with packs see if you cannot find a source where you can buy just one pack to try out your tastes may be different than mine and you might enjoy them 
negative,15/7/21,i bought this pack to have some inexpensive caviar to use for garnish over the holidays the other night i decided to go ahead and use one for some dip it was so bad i could not believe it it was not spoiled it just had an odd flavor with a terrible aftertaste it did not even taste like caviar i threw the jar away 
negative,3/6/21,i would never have ordered this had i known i was only going to be sent and one of them was open and leaking powdered spice out i complained to amazon and i know from experience that they always have awesome customer service since i just got my package today and just opened it now i have to wait a bit to hear back from them on this issue will keep you updated i just wanted you guys to know that even though it states packets it is not must be a misprint double check with amazon before you order this what sounds like an awesome deal is a meh deal if you are getting only of them 
negative,27/9/21,i found this product doing a search for edible gold leaf i decided to purchase after reading rave reviews about food items that were created using it however it is clearly marked not to be consumed and for decorative use only so this is a misleading product 
negative,19/6/21,me and my wife have tried a wide range of the hormel compleats and this is by far the worst tasting one of the bunch i could complain about the lack of chicken but the horrid taste even overshadows that minor drawback i know its a cheap meal but i do expect something at least a little edible if you are looking to the compleats then go with something at least worth you money pick up the far superior tasting spaghetti or turkey dinners and feed this thing to the family dog 
negative,25/5/21,this is a starchy soup rather than the meal portrayed on the outside there is very little taste and very little chicken it is mostly rice in a weak chicken stock thickened with potato and corn starch it is not repulsively bad if you want a light convenient snack the chef boyardee microwavable meals are tastier and more substantial and also more convenient because you just have to pull off the lid which comes away easily with these hormel compleats you have to pierce the top first and then peel it off afterwards which is not so easy especially as it is hot 
negative,7/9/21,the taste is not good at least is not good for japanese and chinese its taste is basically sort of american japanese taste plus the price is not competitive i would suggest asians never buy it 
negative,3/8/21,i read the reviews for this product and had high hopes for a healthy decent tasting cup of noodles needless to say i found this not to be true first the consistency is gross and second the taste is awful maybe i am just not accustomed to eating crap think twice before ordering this product i wish i did 
negative,5/9/21,i have purchased locally many other flavors of da vinci syrups and ordered blueberry online to try it because it is not available locally and i love blueberry well this was a disappointment to me very very sugary sweet with little blueberry flavor not to mention i paid what i would pay locally very disappointed
negative,25/5/21,i tried the martha white turtle fudge chocolate chip cookie recipe and these are the worst cookies i have ever made either there is someone on the staff of martha white who has a lopsided sense of humor or their taste buds have taken a permanent vacation i wasted my time a lot of money on chocolate and pecans and my effort martha white either needs to tweek this recipe or take it off the website so no other unsuspecting housewife will waste her money and time on these worthless cookies my husband picked up one on his way through the kitchen and within two seconds he came back in and threw it in the garbage 
negative,7/9/21,i simply do not like it it is easy to prepare but when i eat it i feel that i am eatting a lot of artificial ingredients i cannot even finish one fourth of it 
negative,11/9/21,we enjoy a taste of tai s peanut noodles they rock that peanutty flavor mmm so we decided to try these um ginger not so much nothing really distinguishes these from any other noodle flavor and the ginger is a bit overpowering take this review in stride though if you are a ginger lover and i am not talking gilligan s island here then these may be right up your alley just a bit outside for me though if i may mix my metaphors 
negative,13/7/21,i had recently tried a similar product from trader joe s and not having a tj s around me presently i decided to try this more readily available variation i did not really like this thing too much for starters there is too much packaging for my liking too many things to throw away and i agree with a previous reviewer that they are kind of big cartons for how much they hold inside the container are packages one for noodles and three for various seasonings then you have to add water they give you a fill line but it is kind of awkward then microwave for minutes then stir then microwave again for one minute the one from trader joe s only has two packets one for noodles one for sauce and no water involved just microwave for minutes and you are done and those are a lot tastier i did not like the texture of this thing everything clumped together too much and it really did not have much taste especially considering the three different packets of seasoning i put in time to try a couple of the other brands of these things 
negative,22/7/21,i bought these for my son to take to work for lunch apparently his co workers found the smell so offensive they asked him not to eat it at work again maybe it was a bad batch 
negative,22/6/21,i had high hopes when i ordered this tea as years ago in san francisco i used to buy a lovely rose black in chinatown which was my favorite tea ever unfortunately this blend lacks body and is very high in caffeine i prefer the opposite a full bodied tea i can brew strong without sending my blood pressure through the roof but for someone who wants a light tasting tea with a powerful caffeine punch this might be a good choice 
negative,28/7/21,i was giving my shihtzu the fromm adult gold dog food she did not seem to want to eat it though so i thought i would try something different i found the harmony farms and thought i would give it a try she actually liked it it is cheaper then the other food and it seemed to contain really healthy ingredients i could not believe how she gobbled this up but after having her on this for a week she developed a rash on her stomach took her off and the rash went away completely in days her hair also was not as soft this kibble did not do well for her 
negative,13/10/21,i read the reviews on this and thought id get some for my dog and pup they will not touch it even if i mix it with home cooked food they like the dollar store dog food better than this amazon let me down on even allowing this dog food to be sold under their name 
negative,19/2/21,i bought these and tried each flavor i could not even finish any bag but the barbecue i really liked the barbecue but all the other flavors were gross and the texture is really like fingernails on a chalk board to me how is this the best selling item amazed anywho to each his own godbless and enjoy but if you are like me and enjoy barbecue just get the barbecue kind 
negative,14/12/20,very tasty chips original and other flavors but ones with salt flavor way too salty not sure who likes so much salt in chips 
negative,14/12/20,i hate to type this because there are so many people that really enjoy this product but take a look at the ingredients in this so called all natural product i have the cheddar cheese flavor right in front of me so that is the only flavor i can vouch for right now about halfway down the list of ingredients you will see yeast extract unfortunately this is the new message many people are still unaware of this fact and natural food companies are taking advantage it is a chemical flavor enhancer whose potential side effects are very scary google message yeast extract for yourself or check out 
negative,19/2/21,these are to potato chips as pringles are to chips as instant coffee is to brewed coffee and stephen baldwin is to alec baldwin same family but scant resemblance so i would buy a single small package at your grocers and try them out not for everyone and certainly not for my family which includes two teenage boys even they take a pass on these unless they are truly desperate crispness is ok even mouth feel is good but there is a lingering not good taste again kind of like pringles ps the flavors are ok but definitely taste like they were made at that flavor factory along the jersey turnpike 
negative,10/1/21,purchased the bag seemed the same size as the other bags when purchased but did not realize it was ounces as compared to other bags just be aware might be perfect for some but not for us having a bag with potato chips in it does not cut it for me might be perfect for kids but just a heads up 
negative,26/3/21,i do not know why everyone loves these chips they are healthy but taste disgusting only the original flavor tasted good so getting the variety pack was a very bad idea i would not buy this again and would rather go with baked chips than these pirate s booty makes popped chips that are way better 
negative,24/3/21,despite the plethora of positive product reviews for these snacks i see no reason to buy them again read those positive reviews and compare the content in some of them to the guidelines of a non profit consumer organization for reviews they contain a lot of wow with little specifics that would have been included by a true believer weigh the others as you will but the proof is still in the pudding the texture is their best asset if you like that sort of texture that is about it for me they appear to be an extruded potato product many of those out there with various seasonings that do not impress me either the most basic of them puts of sodium into the tiny package if you were a deer you might eat them for that alone the fat is reduced that much is true but unless you are ready to trade fat for sodium it is no deal but wait baked kettle chips in a serving up the fat to the same as the of the basic flavor you got free on that one the baked kettles possess sodium vs these chips give you fiber in vs in of baked kettles this product loses again the only place you might gain is in carbs for the kettle chips for these but remember you have extra in the kettle s nutrition info just about a wash and then topping it all the cost an oz vs for baked kettles in subscription wow these wonderful snacks cost per pound packed as they are the prices will fluctuate but think about the things you can buy for that money instead these are microscopic bags that does not help the environment either portion control aside with product largely deriving its kick from sodium and cheap spices the most positive thing i can say is the product is packed very well lots of air in the bags to protect the chips and they will mostly arrive intact in their tiny portions in tiny bags you will not have many crumbs in the bottoms of these little bags so that is a good thing but bottom line expensive junk health food wow 
negative,24/2/21,i decided to give these a try since one of my good friends and her son raved about how good they were bad idea i almost ordered two since they were such a good price i am so glad i did not we do not care of these at all the concept is nice chips that are crunchy and better for you than most but they taste funny they have a funny aftertaste and are not that enjoyable we have been slowly and i mean very slowly making our way through the the box brought we still have left and we received them over two weeks ago so they are not so horrible that you cannot eat them its just like forcing us to eat them so we do not have to throw them all away if you have not had them before i suggest trying them before committing to bags of various yucky flavors 
negative,19/2/21,i love shrimp chips and i love healthier alternatives as well so i thought these would be a match made in heaven not so much the flavors were too strong most of the time i am a huge fan of pepper but even i had a hard time enjoying the salt pepper flavor and the salt and vinegar made me shudder with each bite because of how strong the vinegar flavor is and this is from someone who currently lives in the uk and enjoys all types of vinegar crisps here and too bleh in others the only flavors that my husband and i both liked were the bbq and sour cream and onion and we did not enjoy them enough to want to buy these again i wish these were as good as all the hoopla regarding them said but we still have bags of these in our cabinet four months later uneaten so needless to say i will be giving these away and avoiding them from now on 
negative,14/12/20,i bought those chips after reading good reviews but i was very disappointed with the taste it was nothing like what i expected granted that i expected good old kettle cooked potato chips i bought the flavor variety pack and there were many flavors i did not care for it was worth trying them but i am not going to purchase them again in the future 
negative,19/10/21,the best flavor in this box is the salt and pepper and the bbq flavor all the other flavor was just so so
negative,18/5/21,i was at a charity fund raising event where they were handing these out they seemed pretty tasty so i bought a couple bags at target the ones i bought barbeque and salt and vinegar were awful i ended up throwing away most of them neither i nor anyone else who tried them could choke them down the ones they were handing out as samples were clearly very different from what they are selling do not waste your money 
negative,19/2/21,the only flavor we could stand was the barbecue which was the reason we purchased them in the first place i had to give the others away i will not be buying this again for lunches although the size packaging was great i just wish the other flavors tasted better plain salt pepper etc were not really kid friendly 
negative,14/12/20,these chips taste so dry and gross i would rather eat carrots or something than these they just did not satisfy the salty craving and were not worth the calories 
negative,1/6/21,i bought this because i had been seeing this pod in magazines and other places i thought it would be a great addition to my fridge to save money on cilantro however this is very poorly designed i could not open it what is or ever even after searching through reviews after reviews finally my genius boyfriend found the solution basically you will need to open it from the bottom you will need to squeeze the two sides next to the cap in order to open it you will have to be careful when you are opening or closing it while there is water in the pot if any one who is reading this still having problem opening it let me know i will try to explain it better there but anyway this is a pretty useless product for its productivity but a bit more useful if you are too lazy to make your own and wants a prettier fridge you can make you own with a cup or any container filled with a bit of water and wrapped in plastic bag with the herb so unless you have money to waste do not buy this useless pot 
negative,1/4/21,i have had the herb pods for about months they are a great concept but have a poor design the plastic cover is very hard to take off and snap back on i am constantly afraid that i am going to break it the pods do keep herbs fresh for several weeks in the fridge as long as you replace the water unfortunately i do not use them half of the time i buys herbs because they are more trouble than they are worth 
negative,15/4/21,with no clear instructions on how to open and close the unit the first few times are an act of frustration when i finally realized that if i grip with my thumb and forefinger over the clear plastic shield about one third from it is bottom and squeeze the sides the bottom lip pops out nicely i will agree that this size is too small for most popular herbs like parsley basil ect the company does now make a larger unit and it looks like it is more user friendly all in all i like it i took away one star for the lack of instructions after a few months i have thrown this thing away it became increasingly harder to open and the size was just too small for the herbs i use most i have seen some newer larger units that do not have the issue with opening it like this one has i am going to order one of these i no longer recommend this unit and have lowered it to stars 
negative,19/5/21,despite reading the reviews of others on how hard this was to open i was confident i knew the secret so would be fine not so no matter what i did could not pop off the clear plastic lid instructions showed the bottom part screwing off did not husband could not even do it and he opens everything for me he finally got it open only held about half of the aspargus which is what i wanted it for so tossed it in the garbage and then bought one from progresso that we both can open note to self pay more attention to what people are saying 
negative,19/2/21,even with the tips shared on how to open it it is still pretty difficult to open i guess i have weak hands my husband usually has to open it for me and even he does not do it with ease i would recommend getting the larger prepara herb savor instead of the pod it is much easier to open and can hold more i could hardly fit any cilantro in the pod considering that the grocery sells them in such large bunches and i only use half 
negative,14/12/20,saw this on oprah s favorite things and thought it would make a great little christmas gift for my friends that love cooking as much as i do since they come in packages of three i kept one and gave two away i could not open mine to clean it so my husband had to open it and he had a hard time i thought it was just too tight from the factory my basil looked great after ten days but when i went to use the basil i could not open the pod husband not home neighbor not home dog missing thumbs i tried lightly rapping it against the counter edge and the seam cracked right down the middle okay maybe a little harder than lightly i was pretty frustrated luckily i had emptied the water so i only had a small mess to clean up the pod went into the garbage forcefully i checked with my friends friend had the same problem and her pod is now a rooting capsule for plant clippings because she had to throw away the clear cover it also broke when she squeezed the pod to try to open it friend has now been warned there were no special tips included on how to open the pod and judging from comments i have read we are not the only ones who have had this problem i think this was designed by the same guy that invented the security wrapping tape on music cds i have gone back to my old method a wide mouth mayo jar with pretty hair band holdingdown a circle of fabric it works 
negative,28/7/21,i have been told that the refrigerator of the future will have herb vegetable salad bins inside to grow vegetables and i thought the prepara herb savor pod looked like the perfect precursor wrong the detachable bottom comes loose continually and leaks water everywhere similarly the plastic plug at the back does not hold a good idea a nice looking product but poorly executed refrain from purchasing plastic bags are much much better 
negative,29/6/21,the prepara herb savor pod is advertised holding asparagus that was why i purchased it thinking it would be good for keeping asparagus fresh in reality the pod will hold very few spears and they would need to be quite thin and short the ad is misleading i will keep it for storing herbs but asparagus is out of the question 
negative,15/10/21,after reading a previous review i carefully inspected the cans when they arrived the cans were immaculate and very clean so i felt relieved after cooling in the fridge i ate the first can the fruit was very mushy and not attractive to look at and frankly a disapointment but did not taste rotten per say only minutes later though my mouth felt like acid was eating at it and was very painful for hours even after washing out my mouth i eat much canned and fresh fruit and this was a first for me only days later my teeth and gums were infected and i had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad he found infection and i had to undergo a treatment of antibiotics and painkillers before i was finally ok again after about weeks sheesh needless to say i threw out the remaining cans of fruit the problem must be at the source as the cans and packaging were rate and shining clean quality control must really suck i am all for natural but great care must be taken so contamination is avoided this is a foreign product and their health standards may be lacking there i would stay far away from this stuff if you value your health 
negative,20/7/21,edit i just noticed each bag is only pounds not my review is not stars instead of three first off as you can probably guess by the pictures these are sour gummies that is not said in the description also each one is about to inches in length and inch wide texture and flavor the came to me soft and with the same texture as most gummies such as peach rings the sourness is average not overwhelming but not too little where i took off the stars was the flavor most important part as i chewed them a few different flavors hit my tongue none of which tasted that great i could not make out any of them in particular not good at that anyways but the combination was just plain strange i could see myself getting through one bag but will probably give the other away to nephews niece after all they will eat anything sugar coated right 
negative,12/10/21,i purchased this item because it was cheaper than other olive juices i was looking for a good quality olive juice for martinis i was pretty disappointed the juice is very strong i followed the instructions and put the ratio on the bottle into the shaker and made a martini the ratio was part vodka to part olive juice it was way too salty the olive juice was over powering i made a decent dirty martini with parts vodka part olive juice i would not recommend this item 
negative,19/2/21,ordered this a few months ago only to find it is just basically lactic acid read the ingredients the main label says olive juice by no such thing i am going to suggest that amazon take this off the website 
negative,14/12/20,this product is simply for cheap liquor since taste and quality is not important i prefer to drink my grey goose straight however on occasion it is absolutely delicious with a very tiny splash of olive juice this product was a a quick fix for me to stop purchasing olives in order to use the juice it is not worth it the after taste is worse 
negative,2/7/21,sea salt is more easily administered with a salt mill this is just a salt shaker that delivers uncontrollable amounts of sea salt and anti caking agent into your food and no iodide the anti caking agent is not event that effective so the salt either comes out in clumps or gets stuck at the exit stay away 
negative,11/3/21,this candy tasted like sugar without much rose flavor at all i ended up throwing most of it out because i do not like so much sugar i prefer strong flavors like altoids twin pack mints wintergreen tins the center of the candy does have a licorice flavor because it is an anise seed but there are better licorice candies out there like twizzlers twists black licorice pound bags pack of 
negative,10/4/21,my husband just bought a keurig coffe maker in the box was samples his favorite was donut shop i ordered the k cup for him i was so disappointed out of the k cups were decaf giving me k cups of each of the flavors i also ordered the wolfgang puck sampler i got flavors each how cool is that i would order donut shop again just not the sampler 
negative,22/7/19,i have used cento san marzano dop certified tomatoes many times in the past and was always pleased with the quality of these great tomatoes that said this is the time i have ordered this item from amazon and all cans arrived completely dented and banged up terrible presentation for an expensive item as an aside none of the cans i received has a dop certified label but only certified and no serial on the side of the cans so i am not sure if these tomatoes are actually dop certified or not 
negative,2/2/20,the can that is shown says d o p certified but when my relative ordered them from amazon com the cans that were shipped only indicate certified one can buy these non dop at any walmart what do they mean by certified certified as to what unfortunately the venders are making fools of amazon com as a consequence i am staying away from cento products entirely fool me and amazon once shame on cento fool me and amazon twice shame on me and amazon there is no way i can make this review fun 
negative,2/2/20,these are not dop they are just certified which means nothing significant they should go a step further with a little more nonsense and write department certified real dop tomatoes are much better 
negative,31/8/19,they tomatoes are certified san marzano but not dop like the item shows in picture i called amazon and they sent me another box of for free to fix issue the new shipment was still certified not dop so please know this tomatoes are ok but not the best fyi 
negative,22/7/19,i purchased a case of these tomatoes a couple of months ago and the cans were so badly bent and warped my can opener will not open them i complained to amazon and they shipped another case out right away but those cans are worse than the first case i will not order again 
negative,12/1/20,the product image is misleading the image has the tomatoes as d o p certified but the tomatoes i received are not 
negative,19/2/20,merchandise was not damaged during shipment but supplier send me damaged and incorrect merchandise of the cans were badly dented and the cans they shipped were not dop certified they sent me lower standard merchandise received full refund from amazzon 
negative,27/11/19,of the cans shipped of them had very very serious dents in them i am not talking dings i talking serious dents so dented that i truly thought of throwing them away my husband stopped me though because at a can he felt that it was too wasteful in my local grocery store items this dented are put into a reduced price bin because they usually do not move otherwise cento san marzano certified tomatoes ounce cans pack of 
negative,12/12/19,it is a shame to use so much corn syrup for babies i am very disappointed when i noticed that the same kind sold in china is even better 
negative,26/9/20,do you really want to be feeding your baby a bottle of corn syrup i used this until i realized that i switched to gerber its so much better for your baby 
negative,22/7/19,i decided to try this formula for my baby since he started being very gassy however this formula made him more gassy the formula is very thick and produces a lot of bubbles that gets fed to the baby i tried to make the formula with anticipation to let the bubbles disolve but that did not work 
negative,2/2/20,if your newborn cries inconsolably you should try a lactose free formula right away even though they are so expensive however the ingredients may not look so good it is important to shop around if you are going to use a lactose free formula lactose free formulas always are the most expensive and this one is loaded with processed corn syrup solids from wikipedia baby colic also known as infant colic three month colic infantile colic and colic is a condition in which an otherwise healthy baby cries or screams frequently and for extended periods without any discernible reason you will know it if it happens to your baby and it is awful to not be able to do anything to immediately relieve your baby it contains dha ara and iron but all baby formulas do because it is required by law lactose free formula is expensive is because it goes through a very specialized and difficult manufacturing process i am told by the company s public relations representative so much food in the you s is prepared with corn syrup solids so that should not be a worry i am told ok but i notice the obesity rate is high 
negative,23/5/20,the description of this product is disceptive this product was represented as a powder but it is not a powder it is a granule it is nothing more than shredded coconut and does not even dissolve in a high speed commercial blender unless you are using this product to manufacture a dark chocolate coated coconut patty to me it is useless my intention was to use it as an additive in a healthy shake it ended up ruining the shake as i had to resort to chewing the undissolved tasteless coconut pieces rather than drinking the shake additionally the way the product was packaged there was no protective cardboard preventing the slashing the top package when the box was opened if i could have rated this product zero stars i would have the only redeeming quality was that it was rather inexpensive i gave one package away for free to a patient who loves coconut and she gave it back to me two days later complaining that it was terrible 
negative,22/11/20,i bought this same brand from an online indian grocery store that usually has excellent products i was able to turn it into cream butter using my super blender and adding some water but it barely had any flavor i usually buy the chao kah brand of coconut cream which is quite tasty and flavorful and read another review for a different product for making your own coconut cream my complaint is not the shreds or texture mine was just virtually tasteless 
negative,30/3/20,i bought this for our young son and was disappointed in several aspects of this dispenser it is made of cheap plastic and arrived w the globe scratched and cracked the top does not screw on it just pops off w very little exertion part of the appeal for me was that this dispenser is coin operated what the description on amazon does not tell you however is that a coin is not necessary to dispense the candy furthermore when the crank is just barely turned the candy usually two pieces flies out so quickly that some goes on the floor w o your hand there to catch it a young child is often not coordinated enough to turn the crank and put his hand out to catch the candy the dispenser only came w enough candy to just fill the bottom of the globe it is very much over priced at 
negative,8/7/20,i was disappointed when i received this dispenser it said a large dispenser it looks like something for a child to play with i bought it for my husband to put in his man cave he is a huge m m fan i buy him a tree ornament each year from the m m collections i was hoping it had more substance to it i also did not realize i was unable to return this item 
negative,4/1/20,i found this muffin to be dry and very disappointing if i cut it up and put it in a bowl with yogurt it was ok would not order this flavor again 
negative,30/1/21,the picture shown is for three packages and the price is fair for three but i was only sent one but was charged for three also the item sent was not the item shown i can buy the item shipped all day long at any local grocery store i went to amazon because i was looking for the type shown when i contacted the seller and told them about this they said they would give me partial credit for the item but nothing for shipping seeing as how i was shipped something i did not order i should be entitled to a full refund including shipping i was not offered that if i could give this seller negative stars i would any future buyers beware 
negative,2/11/20,too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest 
negative,17/10/20,the treats were ok my main complaint is they were small about the size of a lifesaver which made it hard to give them to my medium size dog as a treat one treat just di not do it this package should be labeled for toy or small dogs 
negative,22/7/19,i bought bottles of this tart cherry juice because they were cheaper than tart is smart they may be providing the anti oxidents that they say but they completely failed me in helping to sleep better at night i returned bottle to amazon went back to tart is smart i used to wake up times a night have trouble getting back to sleep being nearly retired i can sleep in if i choose with my it is formula i get to sleep fairly quick wake up hours later get anothert hour or two after visiting the bathroom this product may work much better for you but i found one that works for me will stick with it forever i hope to read your opinion of this product soon 
negative,2/2/20,i ordered this item in a large quanity but wanted the items packaged as shown they were for favors in a holiday bag for the company employees when they arrived a few were packaged as shown but the bulk were loose if i had know they would come like this i would have gone to costo or some other discount store for the purchase the cute little box that would have helped make them special and what i thought i paid for was missing 
negative,4/10/20,if you are ordering cookies beware the cookies arrived in crumbles so if you want a box of stale crumbs order away 
negative,1/4/20,two of aunt gussie s cookies contain of daily fat allowance the cookies are so full of grease they fall apart they may be sugar free and gluten free but they make it up with mostly fat i cannot even give them to my grandchildren 
negative,8/5/20,carabou mahogony is the worst tasting cup of coffee i have ever had and i have been drinking coffee for over decades it tastes just like a piece of burnt toast the only way i can make it palatable is to put it over ice add lots of vanilla sugar syrup and milk i have got to find some way to justify the purchase and icing it seems to help 
negative,18/6/20,if you like strong coffee as i do this coffee is over rated i found it weak with a sickening after taste 
negative,20/8/20,honestly i am not sure why so many folks like this coffee in their reviews it is a little weak but mostly just does not have a rich flavor it is really missing something i drink coffee black maybe it tastes better with cream and sugar before buying this coffee i had been drinking starbuck s french roast and folger s black silk both of which taste so much better than this coffee 
negative,1/6/21,please contact the manufacturer and ask them to change back to the old formula if you love this product we just cancelled our subscription of cases per month because the new formula is disgusting not buying again unless the change back to the old version 
negative,4/7/21,ugh i tried this as a replacement for the coconut water with pineapple that was available before in the automatic ship program this stuff is awful it is got added sugar which is not needed at all and actually makes the drink taste pretty gross never getting this stuff again and i do love coconut water in general as it is a fantastic hydrator and tastier than gatorade well usually not this stuff 
negative,5/2/20,almost gagged at first taste i have used other coconut based products water milk cooking oil etc and this is the first time i have been disappointed my teenage kids hated it my son is health food nut and drinks all the protein shakes and he could not stand it i am sure done is not the healthiest but one you try that there is no comparison in flavor tolerance 
negative,22/7/19,i have had amy and brians coconut water yum vico s plain in the tetra pack great the ones in the plastic bottle and some in the larger tetra packs are from concentrate blah and yuck do not get those and the ones in the glass bottles green cover cannot remember the name but pure coconut water great too this one with pineapple no good the added cane juice is superfluous to the natural sweetness of coconut water and pineapple juice it makes the water taste thicker and not so healthy i wish these brands can just stick to the name of the drinks in their ingredients i e coconut water and pineapple juice no more 
negative,2/2/20,i love coconut and pineapple but i was not wild about the one coconut water with a splash of pineapple it was not bad it had a mildly coconutty though not sweet flavor but it just was not anything special it was rather bland and i had a hard time finishing it as it started to warm up since i am not a competitive athlete and do not have any great need to replenish my electrolytes i would rather just drink water 
negative,22/11/20,this product is billed as an all natural anti oxident and electrolyte replacing beverage sort of like all natural gatorade with anti oxidents like a sports beverage it too is also kind of bland i love some of the gatorade flavors some not so much this drink falls into the not so much category for me it is sorta sweet sorta pineapple y and also sorta bland my wife commented that it has a slippery feel in her mouth like the glass had soap in it still i did not think it was that bad but the drink really did not appeal to me in the end yes this drink is probably much better for you than a glass of apple juice and definitely better than some sugar infused punch but as a sports drink i think i will stick with plain old gatorade it is cheaper and contains fewer calories per serving if going the all natural route with your juices drinks is of the utmost importance this may be something to consider and bump this review to stars 
negative,1/3/20,i received a single once container of one coconut water with a splash of pineapple as part of the amazon vine program for review it would have been nice if it had come with a straw especially considering the price of the product now as to the splash of pineapple well it must not have been a very big splash because i never did taste any pineapple so what did i taste it is hard to describe it does not taste like coconut or cane sugar or any natural fruit flavor to be honest it tastes like water sort of like water with an odd undefinable extra flavor it is not a bad flavor or a good flavor it is just meh flavor i do not care how healthy this drink is supposed to be for it is price it should have a better flavor or just have a flavor and as a thirst quencher it does not equal up to gatorade or even a lemonade i feel a glass of tap water would do just as good as job to quench your thirst 
negative,23/11/20,coconut water with a hint of pineapple shipped to the us from indonesia packaged in usually non recyclable disposable containers and catering to the sports drink market good source of electrolytes i took a ounce container and poured servings for teenagers and adults first impression the teens serious athletes were not told what the drink was but i did mention that it was being marketed as a potential sports drink the result no negative votes but no one would choose it over existing drinks everyone recognized the pineapple flavor instantly it leaves a strange feeling in my mouth one teen said this was probably the coconut water it had a residual flavor and feel there was no straw included with the package so the opening and pouring needed the assistance of a fork or knife it is mostly cane sugar water so why bother but the biggest issue is the waste coconut sugar water from indonesia what is the carbon footprint of this product and the container has recycle symbols on it but like milk cartons it is difficult to find a community that will actually keep them out of the landfill bottom line it is not that tasty being little more than sugar water and the transport and packaging waste really do not fit into a culture for me focusing on sustainability 
negative,5/4/21,sojo s diet lacks calcium and if fed as directed will because severe metabolic bone disease in your dog this diet requires supplementation with a balanced calcium phosphorous additive to be safe 
negative,27/4/20,this paste is actually what first got me into thai curry at the time i loved it made it all the time then i discovered a better brand of curry paste hand brand curry paste premium stuff amazon does not sell hint to amazon stock it but you can get it at its based in seattle and they import everything from thailand the flavor of hands brand is so much better the mae ploy a huge difference i went back to mae ploy after having hand brand and i did not even finish my meal very bland boring by comparison also as a side note these are very small containers i was used to buy the large ones at my local asian store these are like the size of those ones not a good deal if you can find it locally 
negative,8/3/21,there is one important thing not mentioned on their label and that it is not for use in containers why hide that info to make more sales of course you will only learn that if you read their q a on their website i studied the labels and opened the back label and it is never mentioned you cannot use it on potted plants thanks bayer now i have to go back to the store to return it i guess a lot of people have wondered why their potted flowers or roses died not knowing it is because of this product if you see your bees dwindle and disappear then this is the reason will systemic products affect your fragrance of your flowers after years of use they will not have a fragrance got earthworms you would not know unless you thoroughly dug through your dirt avoid this 
negative,30/1/20,if i could give this product a minus stars i would there is now very strong evidence that chlothianidin which is in this product is one of the pesticides that is affecting honeybees and contributing to colony collapse disorder this us has yet to ban this pesticide but it has already been banned in other countries avoid this product and any others containing clothianidin 
negative,22/7/19,it is ok soup but i expected more as i love lobster bisque and tried so many different kinds in different places this one is very watery and i could not find any lobster there i guess it is ok for the price but i would never buy this brand of the lobster bisque again 
negative,2/2/20,i gave this product a one because zero was not an option this is like a can of generic tomato soup with some overcooked bits of fish scraps in it the only lobster in the soup was some she will it was salty fishy nasty and inedible not only that but of the cans were dented a complete waste of money beyond disappointing it made me angry 
negative,2/9/20,saw this soup in the supermarket and bought a can opened can heated soup tasted soup dumped soup down drain rinsed mouth with mouthwash enough said 
negative,26/1/21,as far as canned soups go this is ok i was disappointed with the texture extra unexpected bits she will pieces and overall quality having been spoiled by living in maine for years before relocating to the south i tried different brands of canned bisque i have come to the realization that lobster bisque is best when made fresh 
negative,9/1/21,i was not thrilled because i had to pick out tiny bits of gravel the flax seeds themselves were fine top quality if it were not for the gravel bits that get through the sieve w the seeds i guess this would get stars 
negative,30/7/21,i am a little shocked that this so called health food product is made from chinese grown ingredients i would be curious to see what the carbon footprint of each bite is also keep in mind that chinese ingredients and products have been found to have all kinds of contaminants such as lead in toys and melamine in milk and other exported food products all the ingredients in this snack are widely available in the united states why not support products and companies who source locally and consider our own economy before we sell out for a slightly cheaper price your purchasing choice does make a difference let us stop expecting corporations and governments to take care of our safety and economy they never will we can change the way these companies do business for the benefit of our long term health and economical well being make purchase decisions wisely 
negative,30/10/20,mrs may s should inform their customers where exactly their products are made and take a stand i will not be buying any more of her products until further notice no matter how yummy they are do no harm and quality control is a concept not understood in china totally frightening what they are getting away with 
negative,3/8/20,i used to like this product until i learned that it is made in china how many more horror stories do we need to hear about such atrocities as lead in baby toys made in china contaminated baby formula made in china contaminated tooth paste made in china and poisoned pet food before we learn that if it comes from china it should not go in your mouth your baby s mouth or your pet s mouth 
negative,29/1/21,i expected the flavor to be more like that of brewed green tea it really does taste like dried green tea leaves simply dissolved in water although i am sure this is probably a good way to get a concentrated amount of antioxidants i would not order this again 
negative,24/10/21,as others have said this is really mild in flavor the instructions call for packet per oz of water there are packets per box i decided to give it a try as i am basically lazy and wanted some unsweetened unlemoned iced tea that i could make on a moment s whim i started with packet per oz of water then packets per oz of water and got some flavor now i am using packets per oz of water i placed a fairly large order so i could experiment with it and have it throughout the fall and winter since i am using triple the amount of product in order to get some flavor i will probably not order this item again 
negative,24/10/21,i wanted desperately to love or even like this drink mix but am not having success doing so i love mint tea but this tastes all green tea to me it is too strong a green and too weak a mint flavor for me to enjoy it every once in a while i will try to tolerate a bottle again hoping i change my taste it is not gross and so clearly is appealing to some people 
negative,16/10/21,the tea was very weak and not that good now i have six boxes of tea i that no one in my family likes 
negative,24/10/21,i bought this tea as i like blueberries and stash is known as making good teas however when i first emptied the drink mix in the water the color was an odd green not very appetizing once i mixed the powder with water the resulting tea had no real flavor i feel like i wasted my money and cannot get a refund 
negative,25/9/21,this tea was horrible it tasted like potpourri i have really enjoyed other davidson s teas many also containing flowers and thought to try something new i think the last ingredient is where things went bad it was natural flavor which must have been rose oil or something since my tea chemical taste and making a weaker tea did not help at all 
negative,19/10/21,i ordered this because amazon recommended it to go along with the redenbacker popcorn popper i got from them hey only a few of these actually pop most of these small unpopped kernels get thrown out of the popper what an absolute waste of money 
negative,20/10/21,we opened a can of bar harbor clam chowder and could not believe how few clams were in the chowder there were mostly potatoes 
negative,19/10/21,well when i bought this item i thought it would be a direct japan import it is taiwanese it was bought at costco and resold the price label was still the product the product can be bought at costco for half the price if not less the expiration date was not printed on the product which makes me think it was expired i believe this as most of the mochi is dry and tough will shy away from this product 
negative,15/6/21,this comes in a case of so i bought one can locally before ordering the large amount good move i have cats and none of them would eat it this review is for the mature gourmet beef entree have not tried the other favors yet 
negative,4/8/21,i feed hills science diet to my pet because i love him and the vet tells me i should but in all honesty this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap lock reseal that i have ever encountered it is painfully difficult to get it to close properly and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product packaging is important it is no better for your pet to live on stale oxidized food than it would be for you oxidized fats are also called rancid if you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human well you get the idea this is about more than just inconvenience i am posting this review for all the hills science diet products with this kind of packaging if you have had the same experience as me with this product please take the time to let this company know about it i love my animal i want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him but this quite literally the worst reseal that i have ever had the misfortune to encounter theo 
negative,4/8/21,this review will make me sound really stupid but whatever i do not really care as long as people find out what is real and can avoid my mistakes i got my wonderful little sweet bella bean when she was a few days shy of three years old she had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap i have had cats around me my entire life for about twenty five years now my mother always just fed them whatever the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket friskies nine lives kit kaboodle stuff like that and our cats were always fine at least in terms of their eating habits they would eat in the morning stop when they were done come back and eat some more when they got hungry my housemate at the time was working for hill s and assured me that this was the best food ever made so great so on and so forth i now know that she is an utter buffoon but i initially trusted her judgment which is so unfortunate because she does not think she also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags which made it a much more attractive choice i first tried feeding the little bean an unmeasured amount of science diet in a bowl but that did not work as she would devour it in one sitting so then i took to measuring it and she did the same thing then i started parsing it out to twice a day that did not work either because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day running around intentionally destroying things deliberately spilling her water crying etc until she got more food so then i split it into three servings same thing then it got to be four servings that was a little better but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times so then it went back to three all the while i was trying to reduce the amount of food i was feeding her to less than of a cup because she was a little chubby reducing was hell she became even more hungry but i figured she would get used to it not really for over a year she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way knocking things off my desk ripping up any paper she could find scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief as soon as she got food she was back to her sweet self but only for three or four hours we thought she was bored we thought she was a little nutty and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder she always wanted food it was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad a few weeks back we took her to a new good non money factory vet for her second checkup since i have had her i talked with him about her being always hungry he asked what she ate and i told him the adult indoor science diet without saying as much he basically told me that this food is garbage and i should look for something else he said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients science diet does in a very loose by product kind of way ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it healthy instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning not that i care about spending money on the bean but this food is way too expensive for what it is so we began transitioning her onto wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago she is still eating percent science diet with percent wellness you really should not just give a cat different food one day out of the blue but she never freaks out anymore it is amazing and it is percent because she is eating real food now along with that sawdust and chicken hearts i still regrettable have to feed her we have her down to eating twice a day only cup in total she was eating three times a day of a cup in total now she eats some in the morning walks away eats some more a few hours later and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding no more knocking things over no more trashing dad s papers on the desk no more howling no more deliberately spilled water on the floor it is incredible i feel so bad that i was doing this to her for so long we really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever but no she was genuinely hungry because she was not eating any real food do your cat a favor buy her or him so food made with real ingredients things you would eat wellness halo innova evo whatever figure it out for yourself but please do not feed your cat this it is garbage 
negative,18/7/21,we have five cats one an elderly cat of years the other four in the year range the oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease his numbers did not warrant being on prescription food yet but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food because we have five cats and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats since we made the switch weeks ago all of the cats have gained weight this was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight not good for the rest of them our other male went from a slightly chunky lbs to an obese lbs almost three pounds in weeks the females gained between to pounds each we noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl like they could not seem to get full we also saw a lessening of coat quality lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly including with a furminator and one developed bad dandruff the stools developed a really bad odor although i do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which i am grateful for most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened i am very disgusted with science diet they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags one of the sites i researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available if you compare the various science diet formulae that have different health claims on them the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive with other brands such as innova or royal canin there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae now to deal with the weight gain as well as the other problems we noted we are switching foods again this time we are trying royal canin indoor mature wish us luck 
negative,18/10/21,although this seems like a great product it is definitely not minced the cans say it is minced but it is not it is ground beef my cat only likes minced not chunks not ground although she will eat ground cat food sometimes it has to be inviting and delicious yet she just walks away from this i hate it when the packaging lies about the contents of a product the shipping was speedy and the value is great as long as they deliver what the promise now i am stuck with food my cat will not eat at all 
negative,15/6/21,i made the mistake of believing that science diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use after doing some research i realized that science diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or iams i would not recommend any of these options the main ingredients are chicken by product and corn here are some interesting facts cat s cannot digest corn in fact they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition when i fed my cat the science diet he ate all the time constantly after switching him over to castor and pollux indoor cat formula he eats much less now also by product means just that beaks feathers toe nail clippings meat not suitable for human consumption dead animals etc totally not worth the it is cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself does not sound so appealing does it science diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find do not let your vet fool you either vets usually get a cut from hill s to sell you their cat food my recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research try brands like newmans own or castor and pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record i later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals science diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers a requirement is to exclusively feed science diet to the animals try this instead castor pollux ultramix indoor feline fomula dry cat food pound bag 
negative,4/8/21,i did not know anything about chutney until i went on a known recipe cite and found out that they mix the fruit with peppers and vinegar i thought chutney was a different form of marmalade but i was wrong 
negative,8/6/21,i received this box with great anticipation since they do not sell these on the west coast i got the package opened the box and was extremely disappointed the cookies looked like a gorilla shook the box to death and left most of the box filled with crumbs and there was a rodent sized hole on the side of the box so needless to say i will not not be reordering these again 
negative,15/6/21,i made cupcakes with the vanilla cake mix they were just ok they were dense but not overly so so that was not too bad the flavor however is where i was disappointed the vanilla flavor was so subtle that i missed it entirely and i felt like there needed to be a little more sweetness which probably would have also made them a bit more moist the child i made them for only ate a few bites 
negative,4/8/21,i tried vanilla cake mix and pizza crust mix and was disappoined in both they had a medicinal bitter taste and even smelled strange i threw both items away 
negative,25/9/21,the chocolate cake is fantastic so i had reason to think that this would be as well not the case it was very dense tasteless totally unlike the airy tasty chocolate i want my money back or an even exchange for the chocolate cake mix 
negative,19/10/21,i was expecting these cookies were going to be normal size but i was wrong i was planning on dipping them in chocolates but they r not those average size at all so disappointed i now have to go out n find the normal size cookies what a waste of money i also needed but of them were broken they do not put fragile on the box outside 
negative,4/9/21,reading in earlier reviews that these were genuine chinese fortunes i served them with a chinese christmas dinner and was greatly disappointed as were my guests three sample fortunes are life is not a struggle it is a wiggle management is doing things right leadership is doing the right things if you are feeling down try throwing yourself into your work these are not fortunes they are self help mini bites a fortune is your love of travel will soon be satisfied and it does not matter if they are predictive or not what matters is that they state a fortune beware the dog in the corner house would be fun to get life is a wiggle is boring the cookies arrived on schedule as promised and in good condition in their individual wrappers all of that was as i would hoped but content counts in fortune cookies especially 
negative,31/8/21,i love these cookies they taste exactly like oreos but unfortunately every time i eat them cookies at a time i get horrible headaches and migraines which i do not get from real oreos its obviously caused by some of the nutritious ingredients another thumbs down they include vitamin k which should not be eaten by anyone on blood thinners or for anyone middle aged or older who overindulges in these cookies be warned vitamin k can because blood clots headache migraine sufferers beware of these cookies 
negative,9/10/21,i have had many types of pepper jelly and this is by far the worst ever the price is high and the taste is not good the shipping was outrageous more costly than the green pepper jelly do not waste you money 
negative,15/6/21,i am a big fan of hodgson mill products we love their bread mixes i use their pancake mixes i am not afraid of whole grains i mill my own grains wheat kamut rye barley and i even put milled flax seed in my home made yogurt i have been a baker for years and love to try new recipes i had high expectations for this product but was very disappointed by the results the box calls for too much fat and the baked brownies have a distinctly oily feel in the mouth i can enjoy the grittiness and the chocolate flavor is fine but i would caution buyers against the results if following the instructions on the box one of the problems is that the coarse texture of the mix does not allow the fat to be absorbed well i will go back to making whole wheat brownies from scratch a little bit of time required a little less convenient but brownies being a treat and comfort food the texture should be right 
negative,4/8/21,first off i love whole wheat products and flax seed so i hope we just got a bad batch and no it was not expired i checked the date but my mom and i just had some of these and we are not fans they had an oddly fishy grassy taste to it kind of like you might get with rancid flax oil tablets o o
negative,15/6/21,i have made potato bread before with great results but this hodgson bread mix is way too dry it needs some more moisture do not buy it unless you want really dry bread 
negative,4/8/21,white bread is not my thing so that is probably why i do not like this one i like herby white breads and really full bodied white breads but otherwise i always choose whole grains this one is not full bodied and has no particular flavor not interesting at all to me 
negative,15/6/21,i have been eating snow s clam chowder for years so i buy a few cans when it is on sale well it looks like bumble bee has taken over what a big mistake when i opened the can it was all watery and smelled funny i put it in a bowl to microwave and noticed how thin it was but thought i would try it anyway it was nasty to say the least it about made me sick so i went and opened another of the new cans more of the same then i got an older can of the non bumble bee chowder and it was great like always if i could give the new junk no stars i would sucks bad 
negative,4/8/21,looks like and tastes like chocolate colored water no chocolate flavor whatsoever this was a complete disappointment i got the hot chocolate k cups from swiss miss instead how people can be giving this product four and five stars is astounding to me is the amazon ratings system being gamed for this product 
negative,1/10/21,when i bought my keurig brewer i eagerly looked for other beverage options for my wife who is not a coffee drinker i am still looking the grove square hot cocoa had a nasty aftertaste almost metallic no amount of cleaning tinkering with the brewer made any improvement i used the brewer to make hot water for a nestle hot cocoa pack and that was a far superior beverage the grove square quickly found it is way to the trash i will find quality mixes and use the keurig to heat the water from now on 
negative,1/7/18,since i am willing to try alot of new things i thought that i would buy this product and since i do like hot cocoa i bought boxes worst thing i could have done this is bland with very little flavour it also has a grainy texture near the bottom of the mug personally i will not buy this product again i will stay with swiss miss or another hot cocoa brand for the keurig k cup
negative,10/8/18,just plain nasty this item tasted like cardboard very watered down and no flavor to it at all very disappointed
negative,1/7/18,thin runny and the fake milk powder used to add creaminess has an off flavor better off eating your ceramic mug 
negative,10/8/18,i do not expect great hot chocolate from a k cup but it should at least taste like there is some cocoa in it i cannot believe how bad this stuff tastes i tried it times and then threw the rest away 
negative,13/9/18,i wish i had listened to the other bad reviews the artificial sweetener taste is awful i gave two stars only because my husband does not seem to mind i cannot drink this even if they were a bargain 
negative,17/7/18,so bad i returned it my children did not even like it and they are not difficult to please when it comes to sweet drinks or food 
negative,16/1/19,the artificial sweetener ruined this for me it leaves the fake sugar taste in your mouth and my husband who drinks diet soda even noticed at least it was not pricey 
negative,16/1/18,i tried to find the ingredients for this hot cocoa before i bought it but could not find anything online turns out it has one of those mile long ingredient lists and yet that did not help the taste at all it is awful i had three boxes of the stuff sitting around for a month and could not find any takers i finally got rid it of it at the christmas white elephant gift exchange at work i put it with a nice cookbook which was the real present and wrapped it real prettily unfortunately the boss ended up with it i have not asked him if his family enjoyed it because i do not want to put him on the spot judging by the reviews there are a lot of people who like it hopefully he will too maybe it just depends on how your taste buds are trained mine grew up with hot chocolate made on the stove with milk cocoa and sugar and maybe a tiny pinch of salt compared to that this stuff tastes like a chemical experiment anyway instead of trying one of the other brands i now heat some milk in the microwave stir in a couple spoonfuls of hershey s cocoa and some sugar to taste it takes about three minutes and it is delicious now where did i put those mini marshmallows 
negative,16/1/19,well you get what you paid for while this milk chocolate k cup is pretty cheap per cents per count but it is not good it tasted like watered down chocolate as if you put in too much water and not enough milk or chocolate cacao for that matter this thing is sweet though in fact kind of too sweet for my taste i am beginning to think half of the powdery content is sugar sweetener i thought it was the amount of water that made it taste watered down so i lowered the cup size from ounce to ounce on my keurig brewer and it is the same thing 
negative,1/8/20,this is much too watery it tastes very much like the tasteless hot cocoa one gets out of a vending machine after receiving the box and reading the list of ingredients i have decided not to order again this product if definitely not worth the money 
negative,1/7/18,with green mountain hot cocoa being perpetually out of stock in the winter i thought i would give the cheaper grove square brand a shot since the k cup patents are starting to sunset grove square is one of the first unofficial producers of we cannot legally call these k cups but they work in your keurig r tm coffee maker pods and i thought that i would be getting the same overall quality without the licensing fees tacked on to the price well i was right about grove square being cheaper but i think that is the nicest i can be as others have pointed out there is a definite diet or splenda aftertaste this had not been reviewed yet when i bought it so i did not see the warnings from others and re checked the ingredients several times to make sure well it is got calories which seems a bit lower than green mountain but a bit high for something that diet conscious people would want and the ingredient list did not seem to point to obvious diet sweeteners the overall taste is kind of like someone dropped a sugar free tootsie roll in your hot water using the normal cup setting going one size down did not seem to improve much beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter but that just meant a heavier shot of low calorie sweetener to the taste buds the way i see it i saved about by going with this brand on the other hand now i have got of these cups left that are probably going in the trash if i cannot sucker someone er please my discerning guests with a few cups if you drink diet soft drinks by choice you are probably going to like this 
negative,10/8/18,this tastes terrible like putting aritficial sweetener in already sweet hot chocolate the best i have tried so far is swiss miss hot chocolate k cups do not think they are sold on amazon yet 
negative,15/2/20,my whole family people tasted all flavors and they are sickly sweet very disappointed that product has sucralose i would not buy it again
negative,22/4/21,using oz water as the directions state made the cocoa much too weak it was like hot water with a few drops of chocolate syrup using oz made the cocoa much too sweet and still too weak in the chocolate department it uses sucralose as a sweetener which gives it a very intensely sweet flavor this may not be a problem for those who like very sweet things or do not mind the taste of sucralose unfortunately i am not one of those people 
negative,25/9/20,cannot tell you how this tastes because i read the ingredients first but it has trans fats in every flavor the seller should disclose all ingredients in the description i would not have purchased this otherwise 
negative,16/11/19,i received my order of grove square hot cocoa mix today and was very shocked to see that hydrogenated oil was one of the ingredients in the mix i have avoided using any products that contains trans fats because of the negative effects on blood lipid levels i would urge amazon to require an itemized list of ingredients for all food items listed for sale if the ingredients had been listed those of us who have concerns about our health can avoid these products 
negative,9/9/20,this does not taste like cocoa it is very weak no matter what cup size you use i is just not good 
negative,1/7/18,when i got my keurig i fell in love i bought a bunch of different sample packs and two boxes of the grove square hot cocoa i am a bit of a hot cocoa nut partially because i cannot have caffeine and partially because it brings back wonderful memories of playing in the snow and the fun of warming up afterwards i really wanted to love this hot cocoa i tried all three flavors multiple times in different ways i tried them on the different cup sizes adding things etc there is just this strange taste to them that does not sit well on the tongue i am not sure what it is but it has a faint ring of sour milk it really lingers and i have not found anything that takes the taste away i am going to give my second box to a friend she does not seem to notice it my daughter and husband both said it tasted weird so it is not just me i also took it to a friend s house and have tried them in three different keurig machines just to make sure mine did not need to be descaled so i guess my suggestion is to try it before you go for the multiple boxes 
negative,10/8/18,this has to be without a doubt the worst tasting hot chocolate ever the best way to describe the taste of this stuff is really cheap suger free instant hot chocolate swiss miss instant is way better and cost less after only cups threw the rest in the garbage where it belongs and canceled my subscribe and save for this slop 
negative,15/1/20,i guess there is a reason that the ingredient section on this page does not mention that the first ingredient is trans fat partially hydrogenated oil had i know i would not have purchased this consumers need to vote with their dollars and avoid buying items where the manufacturer is using cheap and unhealthy ingredients 
negative,1/9/20,please stay away from artificial sweetners some of them actually change the shape of human cells this has an artificial sweetner
negative,22/7/21,i ordered the dark hot cocoa in hopes it would be real chocolatey and it was no better than buying a pouch of hot chocolate and adding it to hot water i actually think the pouch added to hot water is loads better and a whole lot cheaper v e r y d i a p p o i n t e d for the price it is a rip off 
negative,1/7/18,i cannot believe i did not check out the ingredients for this i never would have bought it if i would have known there was artificial sweetener in it first cup though i got that weird after taste it gives and that was all she wrote if you do not have a problem with a chemical taste or concerns about health problems you may like it not worth it to us 
negative,10/8/18,found my kids actually cutting open the pods and dumping them into a cup to add hot water too they complained that lots of the good stuff stays in the pod kind of defeats the purpose of the packaging so we switched back to packets 
negative,14/5/21,we prefer the swiss miss brand k cup this one was watery in both milk and dark chocolate this is my least favorite of all k cup brands 
negative,17/10/19,we bought both brands to try and found this one with much less chocolate taste then cafe escapes dark chocolate it was also thinner in consistency will not buy again
negative,3/10/21,we bought this to replace our cafe escapes dark chocolate cocoa they are less expensive but you get what you pay for this cocoa is watery brown sugar water with an aftertaste i do not recommend it grove square hot cocoa cups dark single serve cup for keurig k cup brewers count 
negative,15/9/20,i love hot chocolate and was very excited to find a variety pack however these are gross horrible after taste my kids do not even like them now i have boxes of the stuff that no one will drink very disapointed 
negative,30/8/20,i was very excited to get some hot chocolate cups for my keurig and even happier there was a variety pack i read the reviews and even there were some negative ones i went with it anyways i tried the milk chocolate it has such a weird taste to it but i gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried another later that night same weird aftertaste i asked my husband to try it to make sure my taste buds were not off he commented that it had a hot plastic y aftertaste to it not even worth drinking too bad i have more cups that will go to waste 
negative,1/7/18,as a hot chocolate lover i was verrrrry disappointed when i tried this product i first had the peppermint disgusting and then tried the dark chocolate a little better the problem is that you can really taste the artifical sweetener i am a diet soda drinker so i do not have a problem with artifical sweetener it is just that the taste was so strong in these hot chocolates that it overpowered the chocolate taste i definitely will not buy again i would not recommend these to anyone 
negative,10/8/18,i am an avid hot chocolate drinker and this is just does not measure up it reminds me of the sugar free swiss miss no matter what size you set your cup on it is just missing that cocoa flavor maybe the dark chocolate would be better i personally like the cafe escapes milk chocolate better i bought a pack and then i was able to find it at my local grocery store so i bought another one now i am stuck with the pack 
negative,5/12/19,ingredients sugar glucose syrup solids coca processed with alkali partially hydrogenated vegetable oil may contain coconut soybean sunflower palm and or canola nonfat dry milk modified whey maltodextrin salt natural and artificial flavors cellulose gum sodium caseinate cornstarch lactose dipotassium phosphate sucralose mono and diglycerides silicon dioxide soy lecithin artificial color contains milk and soy people please read labels 
negative,21/10/19,i bought this to include in my daughter s party bag it worked so well with the circus theme that we had unfortunately the cracker jacks were stale when i heard this the first time i thought no way cannot be but then someone else told me the same thing and then i heard it again from someone else really disappointing i am so embarrassed 
negative,8/9/20,arrives postage due in a used friendly s box unfriendly do not you think worst service ever totally unfriendly aweful aweful aweful service 
negative,22/9/21,ordered this and most of the boxes were stale and stuck together checked the expiration date and it was not expired starting to think they just changed the expiration date and shipped everything that went bad 
negative,2/10/20,i do not know the deal is here but they are terrible i love cracker jacks and not just because there is a prize especially now that the prizes are pointless compared to what you use to get these arrived and the first box i ate seemed very stale checked the date and was not expired and the date was a long ways away so i figured maybe it was that box but i am a few boxes in now and they are all the same it is like chewing on cardboard i event went to the local to get some to compare and those at were timex better since it was so cheap to get them it is not worth the hassle to send them back so i think i will just give them out for halloween 
negative,25/7/20,cracker jacks were horrible stale not crunchy and tasted awful even though the expiration date on the package had not expired
negative,4/7/21,becareful if you plan to use these more then two months after you order them they expire quick i cannot use these i ordered them to use in my november wedding but they expire in march 
negative,11/9/21,original description and order said assorted chocolates what i got weeks later was one pack of all white chocolates the least desirable not worth the bother of returning even with prime might be better just buying at local store same or cheaper price when you can see what you get 
negative,4/7/21,these look like typical sugar plum jellies but they are actually grape flavored you would assume that they would have a sugar plum flavor they taste like cheap kool aid and not the yummy jelly belly ones i cannot seem to find on amazon 
negative,21/9/21,they decided to ship both my order in one huge box of cans instead of green beans in one box corn in another and i was barely able to get this inside my house then every single can of green beans was dented and cans of corn were dented
negative,11/9/21,the purchase and receipt of the box of chocolates was very good and made my home in plenty of time for christmas the box was opened the day after new years the cholocates were discolored and dry the box had expired two months before i made the order i made a complaint with amazon which was resolved in a few days with full credit to my charge card this company wanted me to mail them back the chocolates which i had saved along with the wrapper they would not reply back to my inquiry as to who would pay for the shipping the chocolates back to the seller i still have the out of date and bad box of cholocate and will keep them for inspection for the next month or so then trash can 
negative,12/10/21,what more can i say barley edible crunch on sugar did come on time but have a feeling that they wanted this unloaded because it did not sell or maybe bad batch does not make you sick or anything like that but you can actually find yourself crunching on sugar like you put a sugar cube in your mouth kids probably do not care hope this helps 
negative,11/10/21,the box has only pasta and dried up sauce no tuna if you can see the words in the spoon on the bottom right of the box it says just add tuna so the products is making a false claim shame on you annie 
negative,28/9/21,instead of a resealable tub with the jelly beans i received a cardboard box with a plastic bag full of jelly beans they were closed with a twist tie and there was no labeling on the bag on the box there was a typed label that said green apple jelly belly oz new there was no ingredient list company logo allergen information or anything else you would expect to find on food packages i certainly would not eat food that arrived in a plastic bag with a twist tie i did ask that it be shipped next day so maybe they could not take the time to package it in the advertised tub amazon was nice enough to give me a full refund which was the only positive part of the experience 
negative,19/10/21,i bought this for fathers day my father loves dried fruits and nuts it came in a somewhat cute crate box and each compartment was in a plastic bag that means that if you do not eat the nuts in one sitting they will go stale as they are now sitting in the open same story for the fruit while all the bags were closed when my father opened them he found that the nuts were stale and the fruit were hard chewy i recommend purchasing this if you need a centerpiece but not if you actually want to eat it 
negative,4/7/21,i have to say that i really wanted to like these muffins but i could not they have a really bitter after taste whether this is attributable to the gluten free nature of the product i do not know the hodgson mill blueberry muffin mix is a far better choice on a positive note they do raise very nicely but it is unfortunate that i find them barely edible and have five more boxes of the mix left 
negative,11/9/21,this product comes from a very good company that makes a number of excellent gluten free as well as non gluten free baking products do not let the poor quality of this one product keep you from trying other products they make this mix is a classic example of a very poorly designed and likely untested gluten free product it lacks enough sugar and moisture ingredients to make the finished product taste good and mix well as with many gluten free products new to the market you find yourself constantly adding something to try to make it right to these i had to add nearly a full cup of sugar to begin to dissipate the very bitter taste i added both applesauce and plain yogurt during different baking sessions to get a consistency that would feel and move like a muffin mix this mix takes too much doctoring to be recommended at all until hodgson mill goes back to the drawing board and fixes this but hodgson mill does have other good products try their blueberry muffin mix and hope that one day amazon will carry a wider array of their gluten free offerings as many are very very good 
negative,12/9/21,i bought these at my local grocery store i wish i would have read the review on here first the positive is they do hold together well and look like a muffin the negative is they are so bitter i could barely finish my half i just recently found out i have celiac disease so i cannot have gluten i have never tried a gluten free muffin mix before so i can not compare it to any others i have tried the betty crocker gluten free brownie mix and that is wonderful so i do believe there would be a good muffin mix out there 
negative,13/7/21,i was really excited and surprised when i found this mix in my local wal mart given it was a good price i figured id give it a shot before i whipped up a batch i figured id do a little investigating to see if there was any input suggestions on the mix wow is everyone using the same mix or what reviews from its great to its horrible like a total split soooooo before i wasted a bunch of money on products to whip up a batch and see for myself i figured id simply open the packae up and take a taste to the mix all on its own ummmmm yeah it totally has a pretty strong bitter after taste and like another reviewer i had figured this mix would be adequately sweet enough for me and not need any extra sweetener i do not like things very sweet at all but its def not as i re read the ingredients i realized there is not any sugar sweetener in this mix so you would def need to add sweetening but overall i do not even plan on taking this mix that far i am pretty certain that adding sugar will not take that aftertaste away that is an issue with the flour mix and no amount of sugar is going to make that go away id strongly suggest avoiding this mix i hope the company works on this mix it has good elements to it i like the fact you can determine how sweet you would want it and the apple pieces are pretty tasty and i think it could be really tasty 
negative,23/10/21,if i could i would give it zero stars i am not a picky eater but this mix did not rise can you say hockey puck was extremely bitter and not sweet even with the recommended amount of sweetener added save your money 
negative,22/9/21,i concur with previous reviewers in that these muffins have such a bitter taste i also bake often and i am certain it was not me my gluten eating husband did not like them either they were also dense if you are looking for an apple cinnamon flavor and need a mix you might be better off using pamela s baking mix which is awesome and adding apples and cinnamon to it the muffin recipe is on the back of the pamela bag in conclusion i do not recommend these they were really disappointing 
negative,4/7/21,i really did not notice elmo on the package these are for kids more than adults nothing wrong with flavor but priced for kids that scream alot 
negative,11/9/21,this hot cocoa is the nastiest tasting instant cocoa i have ever had i know it is not going to taste like the real thing but after just three cups i cannot bring myself to finishing the box i think i will just throw them out our k cup machine is about a month old and the coffee flavors we have tried are all fine so we wanted to try the cocoa the first try was very watery so i thought the cup size needs to be reduced this results in just a sweeter cup of hot water stick with coffee 
negative,8/8/21,these were a little disappointing the hot chocolate is very watery and the flavor is a bit strange kind of plastic tasting have not been able to find a good brand of hot chocolate for keurig
negative,9/7/21,after trying several of these k cups we threw the rest of the box away it only ever created flavorless brown water we then tried the grove square dark chocolate cocoa k cups and were much happier 
negative,24/10/21,sure to be a hit with chalk a holics everywhere from first sip to last this product suggests its european heritage deep in the chalk mines of southern france some seem to be making a case for it only having calories but the keurig chai latte only has and that product actually tastes pretty good i have yet to find a keurig compatible hot chocolate that stands up to plain old swiss miss scooped from a tub or a foil packet and swiss miss is not that great to begin with although it sure is cheaper than this stuff i wonder if the size of the keurig capsule limits the amount of cocoa and powdered milk that can be put into a cup so what ends up there has to be strong and highly compromised 
negative,4/7/21,gross i tried these thinking they would at least taste like the regular powdered mixes the flavor is all fake sweetener odd since sucralose is the last ingredient and no dark chocolate i am bummed because now i have a box of these cups and do not want to drink them 
negative,11/9/21,my son would rather have no cookie than one of these cookies the taste is okay the texture is hard and weird even when microwaved short shelf life if you are buying in bulk not absolutely terrible but worse than average try pamela s chocolate chip cookies they are wonderful or try a baking mix 
negative,24/10/21,i went to check out and found out that the freight is on an canned not fresh produce ridiculous 
negative,22/6/21,my husband did not care for this coffee at all he complained it lacked flavor and aroma 
negative,30/7/21,to make a decent cup of coffee i have to use two pods at a time i prefer a strong cup of coffee even if it is decaf what happened to senseo decaf 
negative,10/7/21,this coffee melitta one one java pods breakfast blend coffee count pods pack of is terrible cheap beans bad roast whatever my lot actually tastes like it is moldy maybe i just got a bad batch i have tried the buzzworthy dark roast melitta pods and they are drinkable even though i prefer medium roast coffees suggest you try one box of these not the box lot i am stuck with also to help you evaluate this response better you should know that i like quality roast kenya aa or sumatra or columbian supremo etc rich flavor type coffees i do not like folgers maxwell house pedestrian type blends but even those are way better than this coffee 
negative,4/7/21,i have a melitta one one machine and have been using juan valdez pods in it when i ran out i searched for pods for it only came up with these melitta brand ones i figured incorrectly that the others were not available purchased these very disappointing my coffee had been nice strong tasty but coffee made with these is weak tasteless i bought a box package of three different types am now stuck with them forget these head to juan valdez same price range unless you like weak coffee 
negative,11/9/21,i am flabbergasted by the glowing reviews that truffle oil is receiving on amazon those of you espousing a desire to drizzle this stuff on your food might be sorely disappointed to learn that the truffle flavor in those tiny bottles of truffle oil are made in a laboratory there is not a molecule of actual truffle in them it is a sinful shame that is perpetuated despite being outed a few years ago in an enlightening new york times article called hocus pocus and a beaker of truffles read it and weep and if you see truffle oil advertised on the menu somewhere you might ask if they are using any other artificial flavorings in their dishes 
negative,20/9/21,i love the product but the bottle design is terrible in order to get the last or so of the body wash out of the bottle in a timely manner you would normally store the bottle upside down with the pointy top that is impossible so you must stand in the shower the try to shake the remaining product the length of the bottle to squirt it out this takes much more time that you will want it to take redesign the bottle with a flat top please 
negative,13/10/21,i will never understand the soaps from mainstream and sometimes otherwise great brands who claim to have a line of sensitive skin products which still contain sodium lauryl or laureth as in this case sulfate if you are someone who needs sensitive skin products there is a more than decent chance that you also need stuff without sls boo refer to their bar soap which is wonderful 
negative,2/8/21,this product gave me a horrible rash it contains both soybean oil and fragrance which are allergens they need to list allergens 
negative,11/6/21,i do not enjoy giving products a bad review but i was so disappointed i had to i have tried quite a few teas and i have been able to drink teas that others say taste like dirty dish water so i can get down some pretty harsh teas i usually do not use any type of sweeteners either because i drink my tea right before bed i have tried to give this tea a chance i have tried it with sugar honey and lemon and masking the flavor with vanilla and a little milk to me this tea smells like dirty feet and probably tastes like them too i have also tried straight chamomile teas before too so i know it is not that i would rather eat the plant itself than drink this tea i have not tried any other twinings products so this review is strictly for this product 
negative,2/8/21,it saddens me to say i had to return this item the item s page specifically said the calamares were packed in olive oil however on the actual boxes the ingrediant showed it was packed in another oil an unhealthy oil that was the bad news the good news is amazon as usual was gracious and professional in allowing me to return this item which is considered to be not returnable that is why i buy everything online from amazon com they are the best 
negative,18/10/21,these bags never close well so if you are a compulsive bag closer forget about it ah the taste you ask dry and dusted with its own carnation in powderized form snack creators branching out by offering traditional products in slightly different forms results in me expressing negative comments via reviews and why oh why does everything have to be miniaturized in order to appeal to rugrats and the type of people who have to proclaim their brood with stick figure ish stickers on the back of their vehicle please just go straight for the original chips ahoy in standard size pig out and forget about the kids for six minutes 
negative,23/7/21,when i eat junk food i would like to enjoy it the guilty pleasure it is these cookies are neither healthy or tasty stick to chewy chocolate chip cookies 
negative,8/7/21,tastes pretty crappy it is like raw cookies it is not even like a cookie it is a squishy thing in a cookie shape
negative,11/6/21,i purchased these thinking they would just be ordinary oatmeal raisin cookies wrong i like chocolate chip and i like oatmeal raisin but these combination cookies just do not work well together i wish i had read the item listing more carefully even my kids said blech 
negative,25/6/21,after eating tang s chocolate and double chocolate cookies all other cookies will taste like expired tepid dogfood to you her cookies will enhance your life in ways you never dreamed possible tim horton s timothy s second cup starbucks treats and those horrid packaged cookies at zupas are just pathetic imitators to the grandeur that is a tang cookie her cookies are da bomb a hawt damn 
negative,2/8/21,overall i was not happy with the crumbiness of these cookies they were way to fragile and crumby there is just too many crumbs in my bed how am i supposed to sleep like this 
negative,11/6/21,i bought these because i had decided i wanted to eat and even snack healthier these had so many good reviews so i decided to try them i admit it was a big mistake to order a whole stupid case without trying them first when i opened them they looked totally unappetizing and then i tasted them it tasted just like a rice cake styrofoam with salt on it they also have a very unusual texture the combination of taste and texture was very disappointing my teenage daughter tried them and felt the same way not even the dog would eat them we tried them with a variety of dips and could not come up with a tolerable way to choke them down luckily i have a niece that is newly vegetarian hungry all the time and she took these off my hands i am still out for buying the case of these to begin with what a waste 
negative,9/7/21,just plug and play with your preferred software no hassles worked great for about months then just stopped working did not drop it it is made of a flimsy plastic and is light as a feather feels cheap it just stopped working when i buy a product i do not just want it to work great for three months totally dissapointed 
negative,22/6/21,i will admit the icicle does allow you to plug any mic with an xlr jack to your computer using a usb jack it does indeed provide phantom power to condenser mics and it will deliver a signal to your recording software beyond that the usefulness depends on your mic and what you consider an acceptable recording level i tried this with an akg blue encore and an akg all deliver very nice sound when used in a conventional recording chain i could barely get an audible record level yelling into the encore my staple for location voice recording normally i plug the encore directly into a digital audio recorder with an xlr cable no mic preamp no phantom power no eq and i get a good clean clear sound level near the peak of input level this is one very disappointing product if you route your mic through a preamp then put the icicle between the preamp and the usb input of your computer you can get a decent record level but that extra equipment is what this light weight gadget is supposed to avoid personally i think you might be better off getting a decent channel strip or mic preamp and an xlr to to mini jack to go between the channel strip and your computer input and forget the icicle altogether blue makes some great products but this is not one of their better ones for those that do not know channel strips combine several pieces of equipment into one box typically a mic preamp and a compressor higher end units add some eq capability as well or have other options 
negative,2/8/21,i was told by the salesman at guitar center that the icicle was easy and very high quality it is perfectly easy but i have had nothing but problems from mine there is a constant popping in anything i record i am using an akg microphone i have had for a long time and it is in perfect condition so the problem is not with my mic anyone else having this problem have not been in touch with tech support yet but i will say i am not happy with the icicle 
negative,11/6/21,i find that even with the gain on maximum the volume is not very loud i use it with a shure mic and my macbook using audacity one must be very close to the mike and speak somewhat loudly when i use the shure mics with a mixer the analog way there are no volume problems it is simple to set up being almost plug and play you have to choose the input source 
negative,8/7/21,the product was simply not recognized by my windows home premium computer very disappointed considering on the blue website it says that it is i gave this the extra star because i am sure its a great product but the lack of communication of the compatibly was very disappointing most likely will not be buying anything else from blue
negative,28/9/21,i had this product for literally only a week and had only used it one time when trying to use it again i found that it was not sending the sound through when i plug it into my pc it recognizes it and the icicle lights up and i select it as my recording device but then when i actually try to record it makes no sound at all and i have tried moving the gain knob around so it is not that this was a complete waste of money unless there is an easy fix that i am missing 
negative,23/8/21,this does not work on windows tried reinstating software and to no surprise it din t work this was a waste of time and money be aware of this issue 
negative,1/8/21,i have been using a standard xlr to usb cable with my shure dynamic mic which works okay except for an annoying hissing noise that accompanies the majority of my vocal recordings i bought the icicle in hopes of eliminating those noise issues when i received the icicle i could not wait to plug it in and take it for a test drive unfortunately right off i got an error unable to load drivers this is a plug and play device so there are no drivers to download and i knew something was not right after restarts and uninstalling the usb hubs and ports numerous times as suggested by icicle s troubleshooting website it was still a no go i went to icicle s website and logged a ticket explaining the issues in detail and that i was running windows the next day i received an email instructing me to send the icicle back as it has a defective driver amazon was great about sending a replacement while the return was on its way so i received the replacement icicle today pulled it out of its packaging and with bated breath plugged it in hoping for success no such luck the same error message came up about the drivers i decided to google my issue icicle compatibility with windows and bam it took me to a guitar center review of the icicle that clearly shows in the product specifications that it is not compatible with windows amazon needs to get on the ball and add this to their information it is nowhere in amazon s description and the icicle techs themselves did not have a clue about it either i found this inadequacy with the blue mic technical team to be unacceptable they probably have non technical csrs pretending to be techs for all their troubleshooting that is one way to save a dime but please people if you are going to give us technical support then say so if it is not really technical support then say it is customer service i am terribly disappointed that this device has not been upgraded to accommodate the newer technologies windows has been out for some time now there is no indication in the little mini booklet that comes in the icicle package that says windows is incompatible it only gives set up info for mac and windows does not show which os i am sending my icicle back to amazon for a refund and will need to look for something that will work with windows if you have a pc that was purchased in or later save yourself the hassle and do not bother with this product as your os will more than likely be windows 
negative,16/7/21,picked one up to use with a laptop running windows home premium the computer saw the item but said it needed troubleshooting nothing worked after researching online i found that many people had run into this problem apparently the firmware is not compatible with windows it is supposedly been corrected in newer runs but there is no way to tell if the one you are purchasing is newer or not i tried contacting blue twice hoping to get a firmware update or check into exchanging it but never got a response from both attempts so i finally just had to return it 
negative,2/8/21,purchased and it came looking new as i had bought it new but it was actually damaged customer service with the actual company is awful as i needed to contact the company itself to return it 
negative,11/6/21,used it a couple of times over the course of a month and it worked great third time high pitched noise and no mic signal coming through not too surprising given how flimsy this thing feels this is apparently a known issue just look at other star reviews of this product nuff said 
negative,26/6/21,i wanted to like this product as it would have been a fast and easy solution for many of my needs but it did not work well at all very noisy lots of hissing and pops that are completely absent when using the same mics and computers with other adapter devices considering the decent reviews by others i may just have a defective unit either way it is going back in the mail today 
negative,20/8/21,i used the icicle for about two hours after taking a break i plug it in and my laptop will not recognize it i did everything i could think of to fix this even hours of searching google nothing in the process of a return it would have been perfect if it just worked 
negative,25/8/21,it works reasonably well with condenser microphones with dynamics the hum exceeds the signal works with windows not with linux the build is very cheap anything more than for this is too much 
negative,19/10/21,been gluten free for years now thought we were done with mixes that tasted awful we threw it away because we did not like it for my money you cannot beat pamela s baking mix but the betty crocker chocolate chips are the best so do not give up betty crocker just work on this one 
negative,2/8/21,i was hoping bisquick got it right when they released this product but they missed their mark i made both biscuits and dumplings chicken dumplings the biscuits came out okay but the flavor was bland the dumplings were fluffy but not very flavorful and turned hard after a day or two 
negative,11/6/21,i love pancakes so giving up gluten was hard for me i have used bisquick for pancakes for years with great results alas the best i got from the gluten free version was edible but not enjoyable it tasted a lot like pillow foam not in a good way i will probably keep the mix for breading things but not for pancakes i have found much better options 
negative,22/10/21,overall this mix is okay but the sugar content is very very high you can actually see the sugar in the mix if you look closely for pancakes or waffles this is fine but for savory concoctions this is not acceptable sausage balls casseroles and biscuits all come out almost inedible this mix is also oddly gritty the grit is very fine but still makes my teeth want to curl i recommend pamela s baking and pancake mix as it is smoother and much more versatile because it is not as sweet a good cook knows you can always add more of something but you cannot take it out if you have added too much that being said if you are traveling and this is the only mix they have it is better than nothing 
negative,6/8/21,i made the waffles and was not impressed definitely not worth the expense it is only redeeming quality was that i seasoned it to bread oven fried pork chops i would rather have saved my money and made up a flour mix from scratch 
negative,24/6/21,thought i had died and gone to heaven when i made the bisquit recipe i was wrong went to indigestion hell i had serious hope for this product i truley loved the mix but it did not love me i have not had indigestion since i gave up gluten until i ate a bisquit from this mix best luck on getting it right bisquick 
negative,17/4/21,i will first say that i have only tried making pancakes with gf bisquick my family s experience with these pancakes however was very disappointing and i will not be trying any other recipe i have tried betty crocker s gf brownies and loved them so when i decided to spend a little extra and try gf bisquick i was greatly let down by the result we could not even finish them we just threw them out if you can tolerate tree nuts and milk products i recommend trying pamela s pancake mix otherwise if you are looking for great gf pancakes look elsewhere gf bisquick is not worth it in our opinion 
negative,10/3/21,my personal preference is to stay clear of this i did not like the smell or taste i was attempting to make pizza crust for the first time on my second attempt it came out better but i did not like the taste of it if i at least liked the taste i would buy again and make my crust very thin 
negative,17/4/21,i bought these for pancakes and i have not used it to make any other recipes so i cannot speak for how it makes biscuits or any other item but for pancakes it is a no go they have a hint of pancake flavor with lots of butter syrup but i do not like smoothering my pancakes in fattening syrup so these pancakes are not for me moving on to other mixes 
negative,21/1/21,when i saw the ingredients on this box i knew it would be a disappointment it would be much better and pretty easy just to make your own mix also there are plenty of other quality mixes out there like pamela s and bob s red mill this will be a huge disappointment to you so do not waste your money 
negative,30/1/21,reading other reviews i was excited to try this mix since it appeared to be gluten free dairy free technically the dry mix is gf df but the basic pancake recipe calls for eggs and milk technically i can use my own egg and milk substitutes but then i could already do this with so many other mixes i have found that mixes that request eggs and or milk really are better with the originals not substitutes the best gf df mixes already include a substitute so the directions only require water and or oil or other non dairy ingredients in this case i will return to my old favorite mixes by the cravings place these are truely targeted for a gf df lifestyle that said if you are not df then perhaps this is a fine choice it would have been better to have a print picture of the back of the package to more clearly see that this is not a great df option 
negative,13/2/21,these pancakes are gross they are pale and do not taste like pancakes i bought these based on the reviews because the maple grove farms pancakes were out of stock that week i expected a lot more from bisquick i mean when these pancakes are fully cooked they look like pale wafers of cream of wheat if you leave them in a little longer to get some color they just get hard and taste worse i hate wasting food so i forced myself to finish the boxes but i do not think i will buy these again even if my other ones are out of stock the only reason i gave these stars is because they are gluten free other than that they are awful i am so glad i have got my maple groves back this week and that these are out of my pantry 
negative,15/1/21,was awful the sight of this in my pan made me sick smells like potato duh potato starch would not brown my child laughed the entire time as i complained because i was so hungry and thought i could have a late night pancake session totally not the case yes i am a gf newbie i tossed the box 
negative,6/3/21,pure toxic garbage eat poison if you want to toxic metals go ahead and buy this junk and feed yourself poison look at all the high ratings apparently people love eating toxic metals not harmful would you eat sodium mercury phosphate enjoy your metals 
negative,8/6/21,a great idea that falls short bisquick gluten free still uses an aluminum based baking powder that is toxic to humans aluminum lodges in our bodies and has been found in quantities unacceptable in autistic individuals the company refuses to respond to customer inquiries concerning this i cannot give this to my family until the baking powder formula has been changed 
negative,7/1/21,i actually was delighted to find this product and my family and i loved the recipes made with it however it has sugar as the ingredient and worse it has aluminum in it why would i intentionally feed my family something neuro toxic when i am trying to avoid gluten to keep healthy i sure wish those companies who jump on the gf bandwagon would keep health in the equation my kids bowel movements are gluten free too but i would not serve it to them for breakfast just sayin 
negative,17/4/21,i am thorougly disgusted with betty crocker for this product gluten free bisquick which is a shame because i do applaud them for their excellent cake cookie and brownie mixes i am not upset with them for for coming out with a gluten free baking mix but for marketing it as though it is an equivalent to bisquick and for pricing it so ridiculously high ingredients for regular bisquick enriched flour partiallly hydrogenated soybean and or cottonseed oil leavening dextrose salt ingredients for gluten free bisquick rice flour sugar leavening baking soda sodium aluminum phosphate monocalcium phosphate modified potato starch salt xanthan gum notice anything missing from the ingredients of gluten free bisquick yup that is right there is no shortening or oil that was the whole point of the original bisquick a baking mix that already had the shortening mixed in that avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits that is why people buy baking mixes for that specific convenience betty crocker has decided to leave out the shortening or oil altogether even though shortening or oil is always naturally gluten free so they cannot pretend it is a safety for celiacs factor it is a cost savings to them pure and simple here is the breakdown of what you are paying a pound for rice flour cents a pound at my local asian store sugar for a pound bag at walmart potato starch also cents a pound at the asian store baking powder a pound at emergency essentials salt for ounces of morton s xanthan gum for ounce on amazon yes xanthan gum is expensive but very very little is needed a ounce box of gluten free bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gum maybe cents worth of xanthan gum betty crocker is charging over times what it would cost you to make their mix at home while eliminating the major convenience factor and cost to themselves but not to you of their regular baking mix i do not mind their making a fair profit especially if the product really were the equivalent of regular bisquick but they are gouging us and being misleading about the product make your own easily and for less than of what they charge since there is no oil in gluten free bisquick you can easily stir up an equivalent make pounds or more at a time with very little effort and it will keep for several months or if you want a real bisquick substitutes betterbatter org has a recipe on the site for a cup for cup substitute for bisquick that does use shortening and non fat dry milk powder or you can use buttermilk powder or even vance s dairy free powder it makes cups at a time stores well and you do not have to use their gluten free flour you can use any gluten free flour replacement you want like rice flour and potato starch from your local asian store mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum about teaspoon for every two cups to find the recipe do a google search of betterbatter bisquick substitute master mix boo on betty crocker 
negative,10/3/21,i regularly purchase this item in the bulk and loved it because it was also dairy free however my last purchase was disappointing after opening a brand new package i noticed a black thing in the mix carefully removed to find out it was a dead flour beetle i sifted the mix and found more dead bugs this is the second time i writing this review amazon did not publish my first review thank you amazon i will not be purchasing this item again 
negative,14/1/21,i have been gluten free since and this is i think the worst tasting gf mix i have come across i have found all to have their own pros and cons but this one have very little to brag about i appreciate the effort anyone puts into a gf product but i could not buy this one again it was like eating reconstituted potatoes that lookes like pancakes no butter or gravy just dehydrated spuds the only real good thing to speak of was the texture it was light and moist but i would have to seriously alter the recipe to add flavor 
negative,24/5/21,i read lots of good reviews and loved the idea of the convenience of this mix for pancakes and waffles so i whipped up some pancakes breakfast for dinner style i am newly diagnosed celiac and thus new to gf so perhaps i should let a little more time go by on just a diet of naturally gluten free foods before i start trying substitute foods for the wheat foods i used to love but i swear i cried a little bit when i ate these pancakes because i thought they sucked frankly they are completely bland and have no flavor at all and the texture was reminiscent of wallpaper paste i do not know if that is gluten free but if so it is probably cheaper to just put some syrup on that and eat it after letting the batter stand minutes to thicken up a bit it was more like kindergarten paste but still totally flavorless my year old daughter gobbled them up so that is something then i cried a litle bit more thinking about the fact that i guess i will never get to teach her how to make a real delicious fluffy wheat pancake but that is a whole other thing i am giving it stars just because it is useful for breading oven baked chicken but you could do that more economically with another gf flour 
negative,14/10/21,the pricing is quite a bit higher than in the grocery stores it is not available in all stores but i have found it conveniently enough for my purposes 
negative,7/2/21,i am giving this two stars as my family did not mind the taste but the texture was so grainy and the biscuts fell apart easily i was not a fan of the pancakes at all i believe they really did not have a good flavor will not be wasting my money on such a tiny package either when you can but a bigger package of regular mix for less not fair to us with allergies in my opinion 
negative,29/3/21,going gluten free is not optional for those diagnosed with celiac disease but eating a pizza made with a dough created with this product is optional and definitely not recommended i knew something was amiss when i opened the product and it was the consistency of very fine white beach sand putting my reservations aside i proceeded to make pizza dough as directed on the box needless to say the pizza dough was chewy and tasted very strange i would not recommmend this product for pizza dough 
negative,17/4/21,bisquick gf is easy to use pancakes and muffins are very tasty the product is quick and easy to use it makes my day gram
negative,10/3/21,these sticks definitely do not look like ones in the picture they are much thinner and imho not worth the money i should have returned it but instead gave my dog gsd at a time to keep her busy i would stick with the redbarn or equivalent from another website 
negative,10/7/21,i just received my order of count regular bully sticks and am extremely disappointed only valuepetsupplies bulk bully sticks are hand measured for consistent thickness i beg to differ the regular size is quoted as thickness the product i received is less than in thickness out of pieces less than five actually measured up to the regular thickness advertised my blue heeler dispatched one piece in less than a minute it usually takes him five minutes on the other hand my toy fox terrier is still working on hers and will not leave leftovers for the big guy to clean up while i understand that valuepetsupplies com sponsors good causes i will be spending an extra cents per piece and get a much more substantial treat 
negative,27/1/21,i ordered these despite my concerns after reading other reviews re small diameter size absolutely true and i regret making the purchase for the same price i briefly ordered from a different amazon vendor the same and length bully sticks for the same price difference original vendor bully sticks were on average thick this vendor bully sticks are at most thick with most closer to what difference does it make our dog a slender lb mixed boxer chow would take days to get through a bully stick and would get hours and hours of good gnawing time in on each one these new thin ones she completely consumes in less than mins that makes a huge difference in how fast we go through the bag will not order again from this supplier 
negative,1/6/21,apparently regular size thinner than standard sized pencils my chihuahuas finish these in a matter of minutes when it normally takes them days to consume a thicker bully stick 
negative,20/8/21,i have used this mix for years for yellow pound cake and everyone seems to love it i am still able to purchase the at my local grocery i was going to order this product but saw that it was oz and was afraid it would not go with the old duncan hines pound cake recipe hope these companies realize the damage they are doing to time proven recipes when they downsize their products 
negative,14/8/21,in the past i was able to make so many different cakes using this cake mix i made rum cakes today thinking i had done something wrong when the first one did not turn out as usual i now realize i did not do anything wrong duncan hines did something wrong by reducing the size of their product i would gladly have paid more for the larger mix now i will never buy another dunkin hines mix how dumb do you think we are 
negative,21/4/21,duncan hines used to be my favorite line of cake mixes i bought them all of the time but now they like betty crocker have downsized their packages of cake mix these new mixes will not work with older recipes that called for the ounce size of cake mix that rules out a lot of our favorite cakes even a plain cake will be changed it will not bake up as high or as big in the pan duncan hines just lost me as a customer pillsbury has not reduced their cake mix sizes at least not yet i will be buying them if they shrink in size i will bake from scratch 
negative,1/4/21,i have bought duncan hines yellow cake mix in the past and have made a favorite recipe with it in the past it had ounces pillsbury and betty crocker have the required ounces i bought duncan hines at safeway because it was less expensive than the other brands and after i got home i discovered why i will not buy duncan hines again unless they go back to the ounces or go to ounces for consumer beware and read the number of ounces in the product 
negative,17/4/21,maybe i got a bad one it is very plain nothing special in flavor i felt like i wasted my time and money i will not buy this flavor again 
negative,10/3/21,i made one for my daughter s birthday party and everyone but her died of uranium poisoning still tasted pretty good though 
negative,22/4/21,be advised you will only receive one box they are less than in the local grocery store will not purchase again 
negative,25/4/21,four of the eleven glass vials arrived broken the product is apparently not able to be returned so i just wasted dollars 
negative,1/4/21,one of the vials was broken when we received this product but you cannot return the product or get a refund what a rip off 
negative,30/6/21,while the flavor and quality of this chili is great the ounce can is mostly liquid the number of servings is listed as but the reality is that it will only serve about unless you add more of your own ingredients as the first reviewer indicated i will not be purchasing this again 
negative,1/3/21,b you r n e d i read the other two reviews and did not heed their warning that is on me they are usable but they were certainly burned 
negative,29/1/21,i cannot believe i wasted almost on this they were burned they were inedible it was so nasty and they took forever to arrive you should take this product off of your product list worst product i have ever ordered
negative,17/4/21,i purchased boxes as gifts at per box i spent over and none could be used every piece was broken and could not be used for the seder sending a gift that is broken and cannot be used is very embarrassing also the return window is april which is ridiculous since the matzo was for the first seder which was on april at night 
negative,10/3/21,trader joe s pomegranate white tea is superior to this tea this is very bitter and perfumey maybe that is what you get when you brew whole leaves and stems i found it repulsive 
negative,30/5/21,some reviewers say the coffee is bitter i like bitter but i did not like this it was not a good bitter taste it was a cringe kind of taste i drink one of the strongest coffee s out there and this was too much for me the strange taste of it turned me off i once owned a coffee pot by melitta too and it took a cone shaped special filter i was not impressed with that either maybe i am just not big on arabica coffee or whatever it is but the taste was unpleasant to me not smooth bitter yes but not smooth it smells ok i agree with charlie another amazon reviewer who said the package was difficult to open it was sealed extremely tight and when you did eventually get it open the bag tore apart no way would i spend bucks for this if i was addicted to it possibly but even then that is steep and i surely will not buy this in the future you can go down to the local name of popular coffee shop here and get bags for this price of freshly ground coffee melitta makes it sound like it is the greatest thing since sliced bread on their package gourmet swiss water process from europe s charming sidewalk cafe s top quality hand picked beans if you want to pay this kind of money and like melitta coffee then get it but i do not think it is anything special 
negative,28/9/21,the initial aroma upon opening the package was decent though subtle unfortunately it quickly dissipated i really could not smell anything after a minute which i assume is due to it being pre ground i brewed this coffee in a french press as well as in a drip brewer both results tasted flat and boring although there was a decent amount of body at least it was inoffensive perhaps a notch up from bad diner coffee for about the same price you could get better tasting fresher beans from a cafe or natural foods store 
negative,6/5/21,i have read lots of other reviews deeming this tea as coffee tasting or with roasted flavors but to be very truthful it tastes just the way i could imagine second hand smoke would it is very very strong requires minutes to steep and is not for the faint hearted i have heard wonderful reviews related to weight loss regarding this product but i was not able to tolerate the taste long enough to actually see any weight loss benefits good luck to those who care to brave this roasted flavor 
negative,20/4/21,this was the worst tasting tea actually the worst tasting anything that i have ever consumed i took one sip and could not bring myself to finish the cup it tasted like dirt which makes sense since it is a root the rest of the tea bags are going in the trash 
negative,20/4/21,first let me state that i brew most of my tea in a gaiwan hence i use loose leaf tea white tea is one of my favorites so i am always on the lookout for a nicely priced bai mudan as much as i love bai hao yinzhen i just cannot afford to drink it exclusively due to the volume of white tea i drink i thought this was a pretty good price and when i opened it up it did not look too bad either much to my surprise after taking the first layer off the top i transfer my tea to good tea tins it was nearly all powder dust with hardly any intact leaves this is extremely problematic if you do not use any filters or screens like me i do not mind when some tea leaves get in my tea and it is pretty much normal if you do not pour through a screen however this was so broken up that it was just unworkable i have only opened one bag at this point so there is a chance that it was just that bag or possibly even a bad batch but at this point i most likely will not be ordering it again that being said the whole leaves that were there on the top looked fine it does have a bit of a green tea taste vs some other high quality white tea i am used to however it is not bad or anything definitely drinkable on a regular basis if the bag was not mostly powder i took a couple pics so i will post them keep in mind this came in two pouches i poured into tins and that is where i took the pictures the product does not actually come in tins 
negative,21/4/21,i also bought two of these as gifts and will be returning them for the same reason as some of the others unacceptable packaging unless you have already tried the product there is nothing about this that makes you want to try it i assumed big mistake that there would be some kind of packaging but there was not this is really sad too because the product is great 
negative,2/5/21,i purchased this as a present but it does not come as shown in the picture it is little white bags with the flavor written on them someone receiving it as a gift would not even know what it was unless i explained it to them will be returning 
negative,18/12/19,after reading all the great reviews i optimistically ordered some of this tea i have had problems with sinus congestion very often this winter and have tried all kinds of remedies with little success unfortunately this really did not do anything for me the taste is ok bearable but it did nothing to relieve my sinus congestion so far the only things i have found that have helped me somewhat are the vicks personal warm mist humidifier and neti xlear 
negative,19/1/20,this tea did not do anything steal have issues with itching throat ear and everything else but i do enjoy the smell of it ill say it last up to a few hours and that is it 
negative,19/1/20,i had high hopes when i purchased this produce shipping was amazingly fast and i have tried it a few times i do not enjoy the taste and since i do not sweeten my tea it was not that great and it did nothing for my sinuses will not purchase again but i do recommend the seller 
negative,31/3/20,i bought this tea during a major sinus infection crisis which included headache earache toothache i drink multiple cups over a few days and am sad to report it had absolutely no effect taste is so so but that is not really what matters as every sinus sufferer knows if eating dirt would make the pain go away we would eat dirt 
negative,18/12/19,i have ordered numerous teas potions lotions and other remedies but have never had a lack of product in an order that was sealed the tea bag wrapping in question was sealed without a tea bag inside i would have said something sooner however i only tried these when i had a sinus infection and the last times i tried to use one the sealed pouch was empty beware 
negative,13/10/19,all natural beef but too soft for my taste does not have the snap and drier outer surface that some like this is a matter of personal taste the product is good just not for everyone i suggest trying this company s old fashioned cold smoked beef sticks strong hickory flavor a good bite of spice and drier texture this company has superb customer service 
negative,28/9/20,i could not resist the price so many beef sticks for so cheap however i think i was expecting something different the jerky has a good taste and at first it was not very oily but as they got older and exposed to the air i did notice some oil spots forming through the casings of the sticks overall if you can consume this say within week of opening they are great if you need something that will stick around longer stick get it then maybe this is not the right product they also sent me a free sample of some of their other products with my order and the shipping was quick i like the company the beef sticks just were not what i was looking for i guess 
negative,16/11/20,i guess it does the job okay and it is much cheaper than hour brand but the packaging it arrived in was in spanish since i do not speak or read spanish i was a little leery of this item since it was impossible for me to read ingredients and nutritional information panel the item is labelled as being made in the usa but the website on the label has a mx extension for being a mexican company i do not have anything against our neighbors to the south i just expect that when i buy something on amazon that the labeling will be in english unless otherwise stated 
negative,27/2/20,i took a chance with this product even though there were not enough good reviews since they are cheaper than hour energy they did not work for me so i tried red rain which did work and was even cheaper red rain did work for me so i am done with hour energy and hour power the ingredients are pretty close to hour energy but someone is lying since it does not work 
negative,26/2/21,i have tried a few of the different energy shots and found that the hour energy have a flowery note lavender in all of their flavours i cannot say i like it the effect is ok but the flavour is like bad flat orange pop and is otherwise uninspiring i think i would prefer the more standard berry flavour of other shots vs this one 
negative,18/12/19,i had to be taken to the er in an ambulance earlier the day before yesterday i was having seizures near syncope passing out but still being somewhat conscious could not breathe and my blood pressure was at stroke level i felt like and thought i was dying or maybe already dead for about hours it was painful and horrifying i think i figured out what it was that caused my near death experience it was probably the energy shot i took minutes before then i do not usually take something like that someone offered it to me and i was so tired i did not even look at the bottle and took it please do not use these 
negative,19/1/20,i purchase banh trang spring rolls skin frequently to prepare a tasty batch of fresh spring rolls but recently i got a container with black spots mixed into the skin i tried to rinse them off when they were soaking but it did not work and had to be thrown away at the bottom of the container skins had what looked to be tiny ants embedded within the skin at that point i decided not to have fresh spring rolls at all until i purchased a fresh batch of a different brand when trying to find the company on the internet to write them directly i was unable locate their company webpage although there were many references to the co name bahn trang 
negative,13/9/20,i bought this brand and it was just horrible amazon needs to source and offer ladies brand wrappers as they are just superior to anything out on the market today 
negative,10/7/20,i have one cat who cannot tolerate this particular fancy feast salmon product it is only the shredded one that gets her but get it does everytime she eats it she throws it up all over everywhere my shoes the white rug and gratefully the tile she ate this for several years with occasional upsets but now it is every time no more for this family i realize that this occurs on an individual basis usually but i also have one younger kitty who is at the occasional upset stage so if you have a kitty with a tender tummy i would avoid this 
negative,14/4/21,i was not impressed with these cookies when i tried them when they first came out and the company had only one flavor i did not care for them but i knew that something more satisfying could be had because i would tried others i have found many great paleo cookie recipes on web sites and in paleo cookbooks that i love and they my friends cooking students and neighbors have really enjoyed if you are looking for rock your taste buds paleo cookies i suggest you check out the recipes for chocolate chip cookies and other flavors of cookies made from blanched almond flour found in the gluten free almond flour cookbook make it paleo and on elana amsterdam s web site 
negative,24/4/21,formula itself is great works wonders for a baby that spits up but wtf why is it so expensive here for cans that is for a can when you can buy a can at any store for less than almost double the price i do not get it 
negative,28/4/21,i love using generous amounts of vinegar on sandwiches salads etc but this drink was so vinegary that i got a bit of a tummy ache it tasted closer to salad dressing than it did a drink i tried really hard to like it but no go 
negative,12/7/21,i bought these bars for several years at my local co operative grocery store and ate them daily they are tasty however the price increased nearly during that time and i noticed that although the individual wrappers within the box remained the same size the bar within the wrapper decreased when i stopped buying these the actual bar was only half the size of the wrapper that is deceptive packaging so i refuse to buy these any more i suspect that other shoppers likewise complained because last month the store where i bought these stopped carrying them 
negative,18/12/19,these are not as good as other bars of this type my kids will not eat them nor will my husband they are all fond of the nutrigrain variety but i thought these would be a healthier alternative 
negative,19/1/20,looked like a good deal so i ordered the ground fennel as well as other spices and seasonings from this company but was disappointed with them all zero flavor not even the fragrance of the right herbs or spices when loosely sealed containers were opened the dill smelled like dried musty grass and the onion even worse ended up throwing them all away save your money do not buy this product 
negative,28/4/21,most of the nuts in these bags were so old they had turned black totally worthless will never order again
negative,8/8/20,i did not even receive the correct product what i received were raw unshelled peanuts but had no option to return them becuase amazon does not allow this i attempted to contact but got no reply do not buy from here 
negative,22/5/21,be careful when odering this because they say it is a pk but you will only get a pk plus the formula goes out in months so if you did like i did and got it early for grandchildren your out of luck so i know i will not be buying off of this site again for food for my grandchildren because they will not be able to eat it 
negative,18/12/19,if one reads this products ingredients they will find that the first ingredient is cows milk then sugar diabetic maker then milk again the fourth ingredient is sunflower oil fifth ingredient is maltodextrin which is starch produced from grain containing the sugars maltose and dextrin with the seventh ingredient being get this tuna fish oil they even feature vitamin which is animal derived there are four different sugar sources in it and some artificial flavor for good measure if we really think about what we are feeding our babies would we use this product i know i would not know your food sources 
negative,19/1/20,these were rancid upon receipt terrible very little sugar if any used something went wrong with these as i cannot believe anyone would see this as a final product both cans 
negative,3/8/20,i felt ripped off the photo clearly shows two bones and the price at plus is indicative of two i thought i was purchasing a bone packaged as two to a pack walmart sells identical big smoked knuckle bones for ea why does not the photo show one bone instead of two if they are just shipping one it was not worth the hassle to return the package to make my point of protest so i am doing it here beartoothjoe
negative,29/7/21,is that these are calories per serving however in all honesty i did not make it through a full serving i was excited about these they looked like a grown up graham cracker first problem was the smell they smelled like melted plastic and something else i would hesitate to even guess what it is but it is bad i bravely pulled out one small crisp hoping that maybe it was the packaging that had the aroma it was not the crisp itself smells horrific i figured there was no way it could taste as bad as it smelled second problem is that i was very very wrong about that they have a funky chemical taste that just defies description the aftertaste is sort of like a skunky chewing on a plastic pen cap that went thru the wash wet cardboard kind of taste seriously it was awful i tasted these about minutes ago and after drinking an entire bottle of water and brushing my teeth i can still taste it i am glad these were an add on but they are still absolutely terrible their only redeeming quality is that they are cute not one single member of my family will actually eat them though so this was definitely a waste of had i known they would be this awful i would have just got a second bag of hi i am skinny sticks sweet onion multigrain ounce only cent more than these but miles better in taste 
negative,8/7/20,tortilla soup is one of my favorite soups and i like both the tomato and chicken broth varieties although i did not expect freshly fried tortilla strips or queso fresco in a canned soup i did expect something that resembled all other tortilla soups i have tried that is a light broth with a mix of vegetables corn beans chicken and mexican spices this soup is thick really thick like the thickest tomato soup you have ever had with a grilled cheese sandwich it is also sweet and does not taste in the least like a mexican soup instead imagine straight tomato soup with a bunch of vegetables beans and some chicken thrown in i ended up giving it all away and to be fair one of the people i gave the soup to said her husband really liked it for a canned soup that much more closely resembles real tortilla soup try campbell s select mexican chicken tortilla ounce cans pack of 
negative,13/4/21,coconut water should not be sweetened actually no sugar should ever be added sweeting things is an american custom which ruins the real flavor of coconut water i lived in jamaica for years and the bahamas for and the coconut water from real coconut does not have any added sugar its natural i will stick to buying the brown hard she will coconuts from the supermarket and drink that it is more natural and unaltered these boxed caned and packaged coconut water are nasty i am still yet to try a brand one of the many that i have tried that will make me want to buy it 
negative,20/2/21,it says habenero peppers on the ingredients but my guess is they just waved it over the closed bottle smells like molasses and soy sauce taste like molasses and soy sauce absolutely boring 
negative,9/12/20,tastes too sweet which jerk seasoning is not walker s woods is the most authentic to taste this was a waste 
negative,1/4/21,i thought i would try this but i am sticking with my uncle joes jerk sauce this is sweet not hot should be hot if they are going to put jerk on the label
negative,25/2/21, first of all somebody is chasing me around and negging all my review so do not pay any attention to those no votes they both arrived within minutes of posting this review this sickly sweetish molasses flavored thing is not jerk sauce does not even remotely resemble a bad facsimile i do not know what world harbors is thinking because this stuff is horrible by the way i like their teriyaki sauce but this its as bad as it gets 
negative,18/12/19,i wanted to love this because i love earl grey tea i need decaf and i adore the convenience of the keurig unfortunately i do not love these the flavor is very weak and does not deliver on the aroma i typically use the large cup setting on the size model but even the small cup is wimpy with these i did find that mixing this one with a stronger flavored decaf tea results in a more suitable strength but then you have to make cups of something the english breakfast decaf is a much better choice 
negative,19/1/20,this slop has the color and consistency of baby diarrhea with whole peas in it our cat ate less than half a bowl of this slop and immediately puked all over the carpet she devours the felidae platinum which we feed as an occasional alternative to newman s own turkey she was raised on felidae dry so i can say that generally the canidae company provides quality products except for this grain free slop you can find the good stuff at felidae canned cat food for senior and overweight cats platinum diet formula pack of ounce cans absolutely do not order this slop from amazon because they will charge you for the privilege of returning the cans your cat will not eat before you make the same stupid mistake i did buy a can from your local pet food store and try it out first then when your cat pukes this slop back up you will only be out instead of the amazon nailed me in my opinion your cat and you will be much better off with newman s own organic cat food especially the turkey and chicken the newman food literally brought our cat back from the brink of death after we listened to our former vet and fed her science diet k d she dropped down to less than pounds in a month we switched her back to newman s own turkey and within one case of small cans she was back up to her usual weight of and has maintained that healthy weight for over months she also gained increased mobility after we stopped feeding her the k d i read somewhere that science diet buys veterinary students their books in exchange for their later recommendations of their products nice just say no to science diet and felidae grain free formula here is the good stuff newman s own organics turkey vegetable formula for cats ounce cans pack of did they really want me to post a video with this review would you then its unanimous this review will remain video free 
negative,14/10/20,i have been feeding wellness grain free for a while now and all three of them love it i ordered the felidae last time because the wellness was no longer eligible for free shipping and the felidae was which makes the difference between whether it is a better deal to order it or buy it at petco brick and mortar none of my cats will eat it they actually at nothing for the past days since the only thing offered them was the felidae i broke down today and gave them a back up can of lives grain free and they are happily curled up and purring now i think felidae is a high quality food and i only feed the lower quality grain free food on rare occasion but the rest of this case will be donated to my local shelter hopefully something there will like it i am off for the trip to petco for the wellness 
negative,10/3/21,i was really hoping this grain free canned cat food will work for my cats looks like it has good ingredients but none of my cats will eat it in fact one of them will smell it and start doing the scratching thing like he smells poop another weird thing is the whole can is kind of soft and meshed like baby food but there are some whole green peas in it not sure if that is by design or some green peas escape the meshing 
negative,15/8/21,yikes what was i thinking when i ordered cans of this stuff the food pantry may be getting some it tastes like well i cannot use the words i would like to let us just say that it has no character at all no distinct taste if yu blinded yourself and then drank the coffee i do not know if you would even know it was coffee i use just more than the amount suggessted does not help 
negative,27/4/21,the taste is great but it gave me a terrible migraine from the message those who are sensitive beware also message addition is usually a way to fake true flavor 
negative,24/1/21,the packet of these seeds that i received must have been old because i do not believe even of them grew i tried some several times in soil and water and only got a few sprigs of grass i garden regularly i live in florida so it is not that i do not know how and i even followed the instructions to the letter but they did not grow 
negative,14/7/20,look at the ingredients it is made with black tea google black tea and fluoride and you will see that black tea is loaded with fluoride because it is made with the oldest part of the tea plant it contains the highest level of fluoride of any tea fluoride is not healthy for anyone if you want a healthy natural tea get one that is made with white tea leaves white tea leaves still have all the beneficial antioxidant properties but much much much less fluoride than either black or green teas 
negative,5/6/21,spent for real kona coffee and did not want the kona blend sold here the hawaiian roasters was disappointing tasted nothing like the kona we had everyday while honeymooning in maui not good
negative,9/7/21,i like my chocolate tempered to some level of crispness these nuts were chewy not crunchy and the chocolate coating was a bit mealy if you know anything about dark chocolate and like yours with some snap do not order these actually the best dark chocolate covered walnuts are called perigord and are available through a canadian company called kis global they are sun dried super crispy covered in a fairly thin she will of dark chocolate and dusted with unsweetened cocoa very adult and superb 
negative,5/6/21,we ordered the product our dog loves them but no one cares if its degrees outside recieved in one big melted ball thought they would ship in dry ice if its summer or hot in your area do not order them 
negative,25/7/21,by the time i received this product all packages were melted so all had to be thrown away because everything in each bag had melted together
negative,13/7/21,i can not believe that this is actually for sale it needs to be recalled sugar is absolutely unhealthy for all your pets they do not digest assimilate sugar like we do every vet will tell you the same thing and you will never see any quality treats or food that has sugar or corn syrup on the ingredient list if you do see it on the list do not buy it 
negative,9/7/21,this is my review for this product the first one was supposed to be words that would be too long for this item the product itself is good but the price for shipping for such a small item was ridiculous the package was small and light weight but i was charged for shipping of a item i have bought many items from amazon com and it seems here lately that the shipping has gotten totally out of hand i bought several items and the shipping was all together therefore i did not know how much was charged for each item i will not buy from this vendor again since they are making money on the shipping enough said 
negative,8/7/21,on top of the delightful aspartame this comes complete with hydrogenated oils and is a dead ringer for country time lemonade mix 
negative,15/7/21,instead of just being pork rinds oil salt and vinegar they have lactose and maltodextrin on them contributing to of sugar per serving many people myself included who buy this kind of snack who are on low carbohydrate diets they will not be happy about the sugar the labeling on the package is very strange and i am surprised it gets by the nice government men who worry about this sort of thing it says total carbohydrates are less then so they get to put zero grams ok fair enough i have seen that before but then the label admits to grams of sugar which is a carbohydrate how they can get away with saying they have zero grams of carbs when there are grams of sugar is beyond me i assume it is just that nobody has caught them yet then there is protein the nutritional analysis says of protein per serving not bad for a snack food right next to the is says not a significant source of protein huh a slice of cheese is about grams of protein as is an ounce of meet i believe those are significant sources of protein i went to their website to check out the nutritional facts i did notice they were high in sodium what i missed was that they claim the number of servings in a oz package was three so the sodium in a package is actually three times higher i doubt many people expect a oz package to be three servings i just looked up fritos corn chips a oz package is considered a single serving package and the analysis on the back shows one serving so when fritos tells you the sodium level it is only mg for the entire package for these pork rinds the oz package is mg of sodium about half of your daily requirement a little steep for a snack although i went to their site to look at some nutritional info they do not shows the label or the actual ingredients on their site or at amazon if they had i would not have purchased it they use partially hydrogenated oil a kind of fat may be destructive to your health long term since the government broke down and required that partially hydrogenated oil be listed on the label a lot of the food industry has switched away from it as people are correctly suspicious of it to add insult to injury i was unhappy with the taste they have a chemical nasty taste i suppose that is subjective but a few bites left me a little queasy i feel bad having bought this but perhaps my error will be of some use to others looking for a low carb snack please pass this company s products by and let us find someone else who can actually provide us the food we want and the information we need in a rational ethical and legal way 
negative,6/7/21,this product which i am not allowed to return has ingrediants of salt spices hydrolysed soy protein that last item is the common industry con for adding message to your food every soup on your grocers shelf contains message but i digress so the third ingrediant is a form of message further down the ingrediant list is proudly displayed monosodium gludamate message this does not add spice to your food it stimulats your tongue into feeling that the food tastes good when it does not message can make dogfood taste like hamburger anyone who thinks this is making their food taste cajun may be serving alpo tones and durkee sp do not contain message i prefer tones i have eight ounce cans of this stuff would anybody like to buy some hamburger from me 
negative,13/8/21,i bought this seasoning because amazon stopped selling the count konriko cajun seasoning so this was the one they had in a count i bought it thinking it would be similar to the konriko boy was i wrong first of all like another reviewer said some of the ingredients are as follows hydrolyzed soy protein and partially hydrogenated cottonseed and soy bean oil i was completely stumped as to why these two ingredients were necessary in a spice blend mix now i know why with the hydrolyzed soy protein as the other reviewer stated it is a industry way of adding message well why in the world do we need that and what is up with the hydrogenated soy bean and cottonseed oil beside it being bad for your health it causes the product to cake and clump i steer clear of products with hydrogenated oils in them an even though this may not have many trans fat an accumulation over time is what makes this deceptively bad for your health when i purchased this last year they did not have the ingredients listed in the description now it is i think that amazon as a regular practice should require all food products company s to list the ingredients of their product to sell on their site why wait until the customer purchase it to find out i do not think this is a customer friendly practice not a good buy i am going to i found my konriko at another site and will be purchasing it from there unless amazon brings it back at a count offer otherwise to buy one at and s h is just way over priced and highway robbery 
negative,5/6/21,i agree with a previous reviewer when it comes to the dinners just about all of the earth s best choices they are watery and sweet apples or some other fruit in just about everything and the first ingredient is nearly always water i have decided to stay away from these as much as possible and purchase protein containing dinners from another jarred brand or mixing my own i would really rather not nurture a sweet tooth at such a young age the earth s best fruits and vegetables for the most part are great just check the label to make sure water is not the first ingredient listed i just love how baby food will have water listed first but then some kind of flour added as well to thicken it up 
negative,9/7/21,as i have with all other earth s best jarred baby food i will not be purchasing these dinners for my baby because the jar lids contain bpa i contacted earth s best s consumer relations dept personally and the representative read me a prepared statement saying that the epoxy resin that lines earth s best baby food jar lids contains trace amounts of bpa but it does not come into direct contact with the food that kind of lukewarm response was not enough to put my concerns about bpa to rest after all packaged food is jostled around so much during shipping that these jars could spend days upside down with the food resting directly on the jar lids so i guess i will have to pass on these jarred dinners for now the earth s best rep did say that they were doing accelerated testing of bpa free alternatives for lining their baby food jars this is such a shame because earth s best is the only company that makes organic pre packaged stage complete meals e g with meat protein veggies carbs starch in puree form all the other organic baby food manufacturers such as plum sprout ella s kitchen etc only make stage meals in chunky form earth s best does make some baby food in bpa free squeeze pouches but that does not include its dinner line i was hoping to be able to expose my little one to a wider variety of flavors and well balanced meals while still at the puree stage but i guess i will have to wait until she is old enough for stage chunky meals or make her baby food myself virtually impossible for this super busy and domestically challenged mom lol 
negative,17/6/21,i ordered this from amazon and they were pure liquid like water i did not feel at all comfortable feeding them to my daughter amazon customer service however was awesome and gave me a full refund
negative,31/8/21,bought this after reading the good reviews not sure if it has to do only with my package but rice and lentil mix literally has a smell of mold i actually opened two containers to make sure it was not just my nose playing tricks on me i love this brand and i am very disappointed 
negative,7/8/21,we ordered the earth s best dinner variety pack along with the fruit variety pack we got the fruit variety pack and an oatmeal and fruit variety pack not the dinner pack found out we cannot return the item either we will try the amazon phone help but if all else fails maybe my little one will like this stuff 
negative,6/9/21,google propylene glycol to find out why i bought this product along with several others without running the ingredients by my wife first a nurse of years she was surprised when she noticed it we went a googling and poured my order down the drain afterwards there is pure and then there is not so much from the website propylene glycol a cosmetic form of mineral oil found in automatic brake and hydraulic fluid and industrial antifreeze in the skin and hair propylene glycol works as a humescent which causes retention of moisture content of skin or cosmetic products by preventing the escape of moisture or water the material safety data sheet warns users to avoid skin contact with propylene glycol as this strong skin irritant can because liver abnormalities and kidney damage also used in tyre sealant rubber cleaner de icer stain removers fabric softener degreaser paint adhesive wallpaper stripper i wrote the company about this concern and they never responded 
negative,5/6/21,received bottles of concentrate from paragon mixed exactly to their specs and was extremely disappointed in four of the six flavors i am truly saddened to have to encourage you to not purchase the watermelon flavor this item has be returned for a refund 
negative,9/7/21,i was disappointed to find out that the lids of earth s best jarred foods are coated with an epoxy lining that contains bpa i thought i was avoiding the whole bpa issue because these are in glass rather than plastic containers if it is in the lids it is going to get in the food as the food moves around in the jar during packaging shipping storage etc i was planning on being a devoted earth s best jarred food user because it was organic and in glass but then i found out about the bpa as a note if bpa does not bother you most of earth s best food is tasty 
negative,19/6/21,packaging was fine but the baby food were rotten however amazon com does not let me return it this is not right i have put the pic of the food on packaging review page buyers should all take a look at it 
negative,5/9/21,just off the phone with them aug and they said that yes they stopped putting bpa in the liners in oct of course there is old stock on the shelves so i asked how to tell whether the liners we have are the old with bpa or the new without bpa and the person there said to look at the inside the surface of the lid if it is all white then it is bpa free if it is metallic or gold then it is the old lids which did contain a bpa layer thought this might help some of you out there 
negative,10/10/21,i ordered this because i really like this brand and i have never had any issue with them my son usually like all the flavors i ordered this and the pears were sour spoiled the other flavors my son refused to eat i am sure there was something wrong with it so i am not sure what happened but i will not be buying these online anymore 
negative,29/9/21,i just called up customer service and found that since october all the jars are bpa free but the jars manufactured before october are still available in the market usually all these products have a long shelf life as they are vacuum sealed so the jars with bpa lining on the lids are still floating around in the market the consumers cannot tell the difference so what is the point in buying this when you do not know if you are giving your baby something that is bpa free or not this is very very disappointing from earth s best 
negative,11/9/21,i usually feed earth s best baby food to my grandson he has never had a reaction of any kind to any baby food i have given him this is the first time i have tried this particular variety pack i fed him the peach oatmeal banana and apples and apricots for breakfast this morning shortly after i noticed he was scratching i looked and he had a rash i remembered reading a baby food review where someone mentioned an allergy so i checked and yes it is this variety pack i do not know what is in it that would because this type of reaction unfortunately i fed him two different jars so i do not know which one caused it but i do not want to take a chance of him having another one so out they go just thought i would let others know 
negative,5/6/21,there is bpa in the lids and company claims it does not touch the food so it is okey why do they even write organic times around the lid not honest to their costumer i would not even give star if l could 
negative,9/7/21,i have a month old who eats food all of the time i bought this variety pack and noticed that the peach oatmeal is thick like a paste coincidentally as i was thinking that as i was feeding him he started choking and gasping for air he could not breathe and i had to give him the heimlich maneuver and luckily he started crying very scary and those jars went right in the garbage 
negative,26/8/21,i love fact that this drink is neither too tangy or tos sweet the combimation of both is perfect and therefore quenches yor thirst without leaving an unpleant after taste t
negative,26/7/21,i would never buy this cake it looks horrible some of the fondant work on this seller s other cakes is shabby the piping is horrible worse than a cake you would buy at the grocery store the flowers look like red and green blobs how can you possibly think you should sell these to people 
negative,11/9/21,i love green tea and green tea beverages when i saw this on sale i was happy to try it once i received it and tasted it i was not so happy first off tasted like the smell of dirty water best way i can describe it lol this has cane juice yet tastes like it does not have anything added calories for what no flavor no thanks so yeah all in all pretty flavorless beside the dirty water smell taste was a huge disappointment worse yet i bought pk cases now i have to doctor the rest up maybe just buy some lemons and make them into a green tea lemonade oh well i tried 
negative,11/9/21,in the attempt to make blueberry cake for my brother i used the whole bottle and still did not have a blueberry cake i added about half the bottle to the cake mix white cake not vanilla and the other half to the frosting white frosting not vanilla and it still only had a hint of blueberry flavor i was completely disappointed in all the time effort and money spent making it and it barely tasted blueberry i would have thought that using the whole bottle would have made a blueberry flavor i guess i will have to see if i can find actual blueberry extract and not blueberry flavored extract will not be wasting my money on this again 
negative,15/9/21,something is very wrong the product is excellent i have been buying it for several years first at whole foods and then when they dropped the product i have been purchasing it online in fact i purchased it in its original larger size jar when the size was decreased to oz the selling price remained the same at whole foods i also purchased all flavors as this product is really delicious the price has been going up considerably i purchase jars per order to save on shipping with each order there is always another price increase my recent order of september for jars was apparently packed at the warehouse and sent to the store the store did not repack it each box of six was sealed with warehouse tape identifying the item it stated the name of the store it was shipped to as well as the flavor the following information shocked me and i quote rigoni fruit sprd oz pack retail did you note the price retail it did not state wholesale it said retail price no one sells it for yet the warehouse stipulates that is the retail price am i missing something here how many hundreds of dollars have i wasted i guess it is a matter of what the market will bear outrageous of course there is the additional shipping chg on principal alone i will give up on this product the greed is beyond comprehension i gave the product a low rating even though the product is excellent because it is incredibly overpriced 
negative,5/6/21,so as soon as the delivery guy gave me the package i opened it ready to eat some gummy bears and all i got was a big goo of gummy bears due to the heat of the delivery truck it all melted into gel of course it is not refundable so now all i have is a bag a liquid multicolored goo thanks for making me throw away dollars good game amazon so think about if its summer or kind of warm stop and wait till december 
negative,9/7/21,the taste is not horrible but it is not very good there is not a very good mango flavor i would not buy again 
negative,14/9/21,this egg pasta ingredient was powdered egg product and as such not as tasty as those containing the real thing i do not like anything powdered but price was right cannot have it all i guess 
negative,29/9/21,i was really disappointed in these olives the are very mushy and i prefer a more firm texture cat cora s olives are much much better 
negative,10/7/21,the picture and description was pure butter mini shortbread round then i decided to order it because i love them so bad but when i got the package it came out at mini chocolate chip shortbread which i do not like 
negative,1/3/20,when habanero is in powder form it does not taste the same nor does it have the same heat it is almost physically impossible to get a habanero powder to taste decent go with habanero flakes instead they taste better and pack a lot more heat 
negative,28/7/20,wasa crisp n light inside packaging cannot be recycled the crackerbread is excellent but its inside packaging is a cellophane or type of plastic that cannot be recycled anywhere in the six states i have contacted todate wasa has not revealed what the inside packaging is made of nor where i can recycle it 
negative,28/7/20,this was my first experience of a bad darjeeling before i had not known there was such a thing the first brew yielded a dark rust color tinged with olive green the bottom of the cup was invisible the taste was sharp and astringent thinking i would brewed too long or too strong i set the first cup aside and tried again and then again a light brew of minutes improved the clarity however nothing i have tried since has removed a level of astringency and a furred taste that i associate with lesser teas the wet leaves are the typical size light brown but unexpectedly interspersed with limp green squares the aroma of dry tea in the bag reminds me of old hay neither moldy nor spoiled just old in contrast the davidson s keemun conjou which arrived in the same shipment smells and tastes like delicious keemun conjou and nothing else given the price i knew i was gamboling and consider this a lost bet i have given the product two stars instead of one because i have not thrown it out yet i keep a supply of lipton s bulk tea for emergencies such as long periods of unemployment and i do not really need more emergency tea perhaps it will work for iced tea by no means am i an expert but i do value tea and so i hope this opinion helps other buyers who are trying to decide between two darjeelings davidson s ships quickly with value pricing and so i am not giving up on the merchant just on this particular darjeeling 
negative,10/11/19,the price is right organic tea at a great price but that is as far as it goes i have tried about of the davidsons so far and they just lack character 
negative,1/3/20,i have never received anything like this from amazon before the product was packed in an old used golf ball box bizarre the cans were all dented and old looking the bowls were chipped up i thought oh well maybe the soup will taste good wrong three different flavors but they were all awful completely inedible all of them were horribly fishy and metallic tasting the worst canned soups i have ever tasted in my life poured them all out and donated the chipped bowls to charity complete waste of money 
negative,3/8/19,while the product is delicious it is annoying that the peanut butter stays on the waxy paper instead of on the product you need a fork to scrape the peanut butter off the protective top sheet 
negative,6/2/21,my cats are not picky eaters and lick their bowls clean of virtually anything i feed them wellness fussie cat fancy feast bff i tried feeding them tiki cat on separate occasions and my cats threw up both times i thought they may have gotten sick the first time from eating something off the floor but when it happened a second time i was certain it was the tiki cat i am not sure if i received a bad batch but i will certainly never be purchasing a tiki cat product again 
negative,24/2/21,she liked the food a little at first but did not want much to do with it the price is very high and not worth it if she will only eat a couple of bites she had tried most of the flavors and would always have the same reaction 
negative,13/5/21,this product smells so bad that i could not even try to consume it it smells sour and rancid and is detectable even before the package was opened the seller has a no return policy so i am out the i spent on this as it will go right into the garbage 
negative,1/3/20,i have been making wonderful homemade vanilla with a recipe that i found on line using vanilla beans purchased from williams sonoma i decided to try spicy world vanilla beans rather than the much more expensive vanilla beans from williams sonoma two vanilla beans from williams sonoma in a pint of vodka resulted in a very dark richly aromatic vanilla after only two months i used three spicy world vanilla beans in a pint of vodka and after two months i had a liquid that looked like weak tea and had the aroma of alcohol i added three more beans and waited the results were disappointing so i added three more vanilla beans you can still see through the vanilla and it does not have the aroma of vanilla i am completely disappointed with the vanilla beans from spicy world they are totally worthless a complete waste of money i would not recommend them or purchase anything from spicy world 
negative,28/7/20,i purchased these beans based on other reviews my plan was to make a premium vanilla extract for family members i purchased a very expensive vodka unusual bottles to fill and waited for my bean order to arrive i was not happy about the wait the beans arrived after the and i rushed to open the package i could not smell the beans as others reported most of the beans were skinny shriveled more dry and a great disappointment i would not recommend this product i will be looking for another source 
negative,13/5/20,this product had pretty good reviews so i thought it would be safe to buy packages so i did boy am i full of regret now i am stuck with packs of these beans and i cannot return any them the moment i opened the bag i should have known it had a stale sour smell to them but the optimistic side of me said these beans look fresh and plump maybe it will not smell like that once i scrape the seeds out i was wrong i made two test batches to see if it was the salt i was using to make my vanilla salt but they both have that weird sour rancid smell i have made vanilla salt before so i know what it is supposed to smell and taste like unfortunately even after a few days this smell is not going away i was really looking forward to making jars of vanilla salt to give out as cheap gifts but now i need to go buy more vanilla beans to replace these which is going to end up costing me i am so disappointed i have not cooked with these seeds so i do not know if the taste and smell transforms with heat or with any other mixed in ingredient i know for sure though that if you are looking to make vanilla extract vanilla sugar or vanilla salt i highly discourage you from buying this product 
negative,26/3/21,true the beans were huge moist and plump with a good mixture of really big fat ones and smaller skinny ones however the most noticeable aroma coming from the bag and the beans is best described as pungent with a side of sour is that normal i have only ever used the crappy dried out grocery store version and was thrilled when i saw such a good deal on these can a vanilla bean expert tell me if that odd unpleasant aroma is what i am supposed to be smelling 
negative,29/8/19,would have rated no star if available beefeaters chicken liver freeze dried treats for dogs are a product of china and irradiated for your protection according to the company s hold message called amazon com customer service and requested a full refund with pre paid returned shipping too bad none of this is in the product description amazon csr was very helpful and very cooperative postage paid shipping label received via email immediately thank you amazon com 
negative,7/2/21,anyone see where theses are made i am avoiding treats from china because of all the problems lately and i do not see a country of origin here 
negative,14/10/21,i am of russian descent and have been eating buckwheat for my entire life i live in the us and usually buy buckwheat in local russian or eastern european stores this is the first and last time i tried american made buckwheat here are things that i found it takes only min to cook this normally it takes min and this item is not branded as an instant buckwheat it tastes quite different than usual there is a strong metallic smell this item is overpriced just go to the closest russian or eastern european shop and buy the same thing times cheaper 
negative,7/8/20,i really wanted a decaf product so did not have a lot of options this powder essentially makes a chocolate flavored blended drink even when i use cold decaf coffee or espresso as the base the chocolate is what you taste when i think of an iced coffee drink i think of coffee with a hint of chocolate mocha not the other way around as other reviewers point out the calories is for half the packet and no milk added i will try a different brand next time i am still on the hunt for a mix that creates the same flavor i have experienced once in a great while at a coffee shop or like the iced blended at a west coast chain cb tl that is overpriced to have shipped and i think is available sugar free 
negative,1/3/20,i really wanted to like this as it was organic and came in a glass bottle but there was hardly any flavor at all i could barely smell it and even when i poured a generous amount on my dish it imparts little to no truffle flavor aroma my truffle salt is much more potent 
negative,28/7/20,this was not good the flavor was lacking and barely came through unlike the hint water which i really enjoy i wanted this to be good and was so excited to get it but it just disappointed 
negative,14/9/21,the oatmeal inside the canisters was good however the packaging by amazon was terrible every single can arrived dented and several of the cans popped open amazon treats products terribly i have not ordered from amazon in a long time not since they sent me expired pirate s booty which i tossed i thought they had gotten better and decided to give them another try what a mistake never again customer service at amazon leaves much to be desired as well if you get someone they will probably speak broken english and be very hard to understand then they will not understand the problem you will have to ask for a supervisor who you hope will speak better english be prepared to wait a long time for a supervisor and you may be disconnected several times before actually getting through to a supervisor the supervisor will ask for every piece of identification imaginable not short of your ssn before saying well what do you want me to do uh you are customer service service the customer amazon has lost my business forever 
negative,17/12/20,my baby enjoyed this flavor when i purchased it at a store i ordered a case of it from amazon the whole case arrived moldy each jar popped when i opened it too showing that it was properly sealed i contacted earth s best they said they would look into it but would not follow up with me given what is going on in our food industry i will not purchase any more products from this company it is to scary when feeding a baby amazon refunded me but did not take it any further be very careful and inform other families too update i was so disappointed with the lack of concern from earth s best and amazon i contacted the fda they referred me to the usda because the product contained meat they took it very serious and had also received several complaints they have come to my house and written a report if anyone else noticed this problem please contact the usda to report your claim problem they will investigate the problem and the earth s best plant to make sure they are following regulations

negative,14/7/21,i do not think it is eb i think it is amazon i buy eb from babies r us target and whole foods and have not had any problems it is only the shipments from amazon that come moldy 
negative,18/7/19,when i saw some of the earth s best jars offered as a gold box deal i remembered that i needed to offer a caveat to other parents my children have previously enjoyed many earth s best flavors which in general taste quite good so in february when there was a promotional offer through amazon we ordered two packs when they arrived one of the packs seemed ok but the other pack contained several broken jars and was leaking it smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second pack i noticed that the shipping box holding the two packs had air filled padding on only the top side of the box which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side i do not know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery but either way i was afraid to use the unbroken jars too because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too for more durable items i still order from amazon but i canceled my subscription of the earth s best jars and from now on will buy jars at a physical store where i can check them first 
negative,1/3/20,i also ordered a flat of food they were on sale that contained the turkey and wild rice dinner one of them was also improperly sealed the lid popped we were lucky because i just happened to check that one now i am so paranoid that i check all of them several times i called earth s best and they assured me that they have not had this problem before and that i should not worry about it i am so suprised that this got passed qa qc inspection at a baby food manufacturer why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety 
negative,28/7/20,my daughter thinks this tastes nasty and i agree she is sensitive to carrot so i was looking for a food for travel that delivers protein but does not contain carrot though she eats homemade turkey and peas all the time she would not even take a full bite of this i tasted a little bit and i can see why 
negative,13/6/20,this was not a hit it is bitter like maybe the carrots were not sweet and or not peeled and the main ingredient is carrots amazon should include the ingredients for all items quality control seems to be an issue this is the second gourmet meal flavor with this issue i had never had a bad experience with the eb products before very disappointing 
negative,10/3/20,my girls seem to like this food they have only ever shown an opposition to green beans but it is so messy it is apparently tomato based and it gets everywhere where we usually just wipe their faces gently you really have to clean them it simply turns their skin orange and the bowls and spoon end up crazy oily even after soaking 
negative,9/5/20,my mo old daughter only eats earth s best products and loves all of them that is except this i cannot figure out what it is but we finally concluded that it smells a little like catfood i tried feeding her this mango chicken flavor a few different times and she would only eat a few bites i gave up and donated the rest to the food bank hoping someone else s child would like it i have had a good experience with the subscribe and save products in general no broken jars and the quick delivery is great i find that it is cheaper than whole foods even with the coupons this is the only flavor of earth s best baby food that my daughter dislikes for what it is worth i suggest skipping this one or trying it in a variety pack first 
negative,14/5/19,it was bad before we open them i saw them when we got i did open it had some spot green color i did not know what it was i was very upset do not buy this product 
negative,19/10/20,when i saw some of the earth s best jars offered as a gold box deal i remembered that i needed to offer a caveat to other parents my children have previously enjoyed many earth s best flavors which in general taste quite good so in february when there was a promotional offer through amazon we ordered two packs of the tender beef spinach when they arrived one of the packs seemed ok but the other pack contained several broken jars and was leaking it smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second pack i noticed that the shipping box holding the two packs had air filled padding on only the top side of the box which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side i do not know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery but either way i was afraid to use the unbroken jars too because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too for more durable items i still order from amazon but i canceled my subscription of the earth s best jars and from now on will buy jars at a physical store where i can check them first 
negative,1/3/20,this is for puppies the bag is super small the bag did not last more than a day i thought it was funny when i got the bag i thought it was a gift to be honest 
negative,28/7/20,i am big coffee lover this was some of the worst coffee i have ever had it smells wonderful but the taste is horrible i would not recommend purchasing this coffee at all 
negative,7/3/20,several of the seller s listings indicate kona blend but the delivered product does not have this package printing as a long time kona coffee drinker the contents are more indicative of or less kona coffee have ordered twice and completely disappointed 
negative,4/8/20,you have to put a lot of sugar in this to make it taste good the coffee just by itself kind if has a stinky smell like a poopy diaper or a pee pee poo poo puppy in a cup next time i am going for raspberry flavored coffee because the chocolate is like poop yuck 
negative,26/12/19,i bought this bag and found it cheaper at smart and final it was also old and and white this was terrible i bought it to put in the candy canisters i give to co workers so i did not find out it was old till a co worker informed me i was so embarrassed do not buy this candy it all ended up in the trash very disappointed 
negative,28/3/21,this candy was obviously old each chocolate was discolored the krackel krispies were not crispy and the chocolate was not right peant butter cups and goodbars nasty the nuts are horrible hersheys pulls their candy off of the shelves in the stores when it is getting old seller must have bought it up sold it here last year or the year before it has to be at least or more years old do not buy chocolate from zany values it is not good for you i am sure that if the candy were fresh that it would have been just fine i have re ordered from a different vendor and will let you know if theirs is fresh as it should be or not 
negative,6/2/20,i do not know what all the positive reviewers here are raving about i tried ghiraradelli s premium cocoa mix and found it much too sweet that it was almost unpalatable and not a very chocolatey taste either the directions given for one serving are tbsp of the powder to oz of milk did they meant tsp using their directions would yield a total of cups of hot cocoa not very economical for a product with so much sugar i had high hopes for this product but was very disappointed 
negative,25/4/21,very bitter i could not taste the coffee at all it basically tastes like baking cocoa no sweetness no richness not coffee i bought the pack though so i have begun mixing it half and half with swiss miss in the can and then sprinkling it with instant coffee after i have made a cup even making it with whole milk could not make this yummy by itself if you like a rich chocolate taste with just a bit of coffee shop elsewhere 
negative,3/8/20,i love hot cocoa and hot chocolate and have tried many different brands ghiradelli is by far the worst that i have ever tasted i honestly do not have any idea how they ever became famous for their hot cocoa this cocoa has an awful stale taste and you can tell that it is made of cheap ingredients it even tastes worse than the much lower cost brands like swiss miss and nestle if you want a real hot chocolate look up marie belle it is thick and rich not weirdly processed garbage like ghiradelli 
negative,15/4/19,not really sure what i expected but since i like ghirardelli chocolate and i like hot chocolate and hot mochas from coffee shops i thought i would like this product unfortunately despite following the directions and making this in milk it is not as rich and satifying as i hoped i hate to say it but i think swiss miss mixed instant coffee tastes better than this that is unfortunate because this is a four pack of cannisters and i am only half way through the first one 
negative,9/3/18,i only use c h bakers sugar for all my baking needs and i go through it fast with a lot of baking i looked on amazon to see if i could purchase it in a case for ease and cost savings at the grocery store one carton costs less than so to get three of them it would cost or less here on amazon it is plus shipping that totals for a product yep that is almost times more expensive than if i just purchase it at the local grocery store i love amazon and was really shocked to see this price this is a definite no thanks i know better than to purchase this item here 
negative,18/5/18,too soft i just used this sugar to bake one of the layers for a firm pound cake like layer cake intended for decoration wilton butter cake recipe this is a pretty hardy cake and can stand up to changes in temperature etc and still turn out well i had already baked several of the layers with regular granulated sugar before i ran out and decided to use some of this baking sugar be forewarned this sugar makes cakes far too tender the layer literally fell apart coming out of the pan and it was well cooled and in a pan liberally covered in cake release even when i was mixing the batter it for some reason stuck to my stainless bowl and was impossible to scrape entirely out i am sure this is good for meringues and such but i would never attempt to use it again for a cake or even cookies you would never get them out of or off the pan 
negative,9/3/18,the seeds are fresh the shells are hard and the seeds are jumbo sized the taste is good but the over powering amount of salt ruins the experience the ranch flavor would be much tastier if the salt used were lessened then again without the overwhelming amount of salt david might have to use a bit more of the flavor for which you are actually paying by the way i do not often find items too salty but this borders on the ridiculous i am going to i wholeheartedly endorse the jumbo size seeds as they are much more enjoyable than the puny regular sized sunflower seeds by david i will be buying another brand of sunflower seeds in the future hoping that it will not have the amount of salt the david s have update i finished all but a little of the case of david buffalo ranch flavored seeds and bought a case of the jumbo brand ranch flavored sunflower seeds i compared them back to back the jumbo brand is far less salty and flavorful compared to david s it will be interesting how i will find the jumbo brand to be after eating them for awhile right now they seem a bit under flavored still that is preferable to david s overuse of salt 
negative,27/2/18,the product is a good value for the amount you get however it is way too salty the product is very dry and firm i think this would be good if they cut the salt content in half 
negative,20/2/18,i am really disappointed with the changes in quality it is not even the same product that we used to love a couple of years ago the product was consistently fantastic but now the taste quality of the meat and freshness are hit or miss and recently it is all been a miss 
negative,22/3/18,i read the reviews and thought i like salt i thought the saltiness was on the exterior of the jerky there is very little salt taste on the outside of the jerky but the saltiness comes out with every chew the strips are about the size of a chopstick or a very thin pencil ounces for is way too expensive there is very little beef flavor but too be fair it is probably covered up by the salt these taste very similar to the chopped and formed cheap jerky at the convenience mart that you swear you will never buy again but much more salty the amount of salt made my tongue numb if you want good jerky keep looking jack link s smokehouse beef jerky strips wood smoked count jar 
negative,12/3/18,the jack link s jerky strips were verrrryyyy skinny some were only about inch wide and counted as one strip if i had known this i would not have ordered the beef jerky strips tasty but totally not worth the money 
negative,9/2/18,too salty enough said i order the wood smoked count jar remember the price is for only one jar not two 
negative,7/12/17,i like almost everything about this jerky the toughness and chewiness but it is just too salty if you nibble it you may enjoy it but that is not how i eat also it is not good for my health to eat something this salty i have run into too many of salty beef jerky patches recently this review is for the wood smoked but if other flavors contains the same amount of salt per serving they will be just as salty why everything is either too fatty sweet or salty are they trying to get us addicted 
negative,24/5/19,i buy jerky all the time always willing to try something new i have even made my own at home i agree with the review that called these salt sticks they are way too salty for my taste also being a jerky eater for years i eat it because i like the toughness and chewiness of jerk but the tube i got was nearly un chewable i have bit into some hard jerky in my time but jeez louise these were literally like chewing leather many of the strips would not yield to my super powered bite 
negative,9/3/18,this is a good name and a good value the texture and size of the jerky is fine but be prepared for the salt it ruined it for me 
negative,18/5/18,wow the hickory smoked jerkey sticks were incredibly salty i could not even eat half of the stick i have had different people try them and they had the same problem they are so terrible it tastes like you are dumping salt into your mouth avoid these at all costs 
negative,23/3/18,first time ordering this jerky from amazon and i highly recommend to everyone do not buy it it is harder than a rock i have bought it from other sellers not amazon and it is much better the experation date is not for another year but you cannot even bite it or chew it horrible i think its the worst jerky i have ever bought 
negative,8/9/20,i do not eat beef jerky and i wanted to buy some for a christmas gift i read all of the reviews at amazon com and decided that jack links would be the best purchase it came nicely packaged but there is liquid in the packaging a lot of it if you turn the packaging upside down the movement of the liquid is obvious so now i have to pay to return soupy beef jerky and buy a different type three days since my original review amazon cannot accept returns of food items so it kindly replaced the beef jerky the replacement also has liquid in it it is not fat but a liquid as described above this time i am asking for a refund 
negative,23/2/18,i buy jack links peppered jerky every month i tried these as this was the first time seeing them do not waste your money they are so tough even the kids would not eat them they do not taste anything like the other peppered jerkys stick with the oz or the oz sticks they are moist and not so much grizzle 
negative,18/7/20,this is the worst jerky i have ever tasted it is not edible i actually gave it to my dog and he spit it out i kid you not do not buy this product unless you are a bar owner and want your customers to guzzle beers to put out the salty fire that is created when you eat a small bite of this crap i deserve a refund for buying this dog food oh excuse me i forgot even my dog will not eat it 
negative,14/6/18,i did not realize when i decided to purchase these that they were boxed and because of that i found them stale and hard i had previously purchased these at a local store who packaged them in plastic and they were soft and fresh sorry that i could not give these a better review 
negative,2/11/18,i have not had a cat yet that liked this one it is just a little too interesting for them i think it smells nasty but i think it is just the taste that really gets them my current cat just will not touch it he might eat a couple of bites if he is really hungry but i always wind up throwing it out this one is ground so if your cat likes pieces do not try this one 
negative,14/10/18,this says pack so i assumed like other purchases that i made that it was boxes each with packs big mistake you only get four little pouches who would pay over for a little squirt of applesauce do not make the same mistake buy elsewhere 
negative,6/4/20,i honestly have to say that i just will not buy this variety it looks bad smells bad and i am sure tastes bad because my cat will not touch it no way no how will not even look at it my other cat was the same way with this one it just looks like a huge ground up mess of leftovers they had at a fish market i am sure some cats must like it because it is still being made but there is other things out there much much better than this one 
negative,9/3/18,instead of a black graduation cap a top hat was sent instead not great for a graduation gift also i think any buyer should be aware that by godiva pack they mean pieces of candy very confusing description especially when you consider that the picture shows at least pieces of candy definitely not worth the price 
negative,18/5/18,many people are buying this food believing it is safer because it is made in new zealand it is now made in the us by performance pet products i have been feeding this food to my cats since the recall horror of and prior to the change it was excellent food and i was thrilled with it since ziwipeak has been switched to canning in the us it has been a nightmare several times in the last year i have opened the food to find it is a green or blue colour i had to return those cans because it made both my cats vomit and have loose stools also recently i have found large sharp bone pieces are present and very large strange chunks of greyish pink material that looks like connective tissue i have contacted the us distributor twice but they have never replied a batch i got this month with an expiry date of has caused severe vomiting and shedding with both cats who were previously healthy 
negative,7/3/18,my cats absolutely would not eat this food so it was a waste of money it is just sitting in our cabinets i will donate it to a shelter 
negative,24/1/19,in christmas i first ordered clayton fruit cakes they where great nice big cherries and other fruits and nuts these were overloaded with the good stuff that makes a fruit cake really great so i re ordered in christmas of what a disappointment i ordered one pound cakes when my order arrived i was so excited yes i like fruit cake only too be very disappointed not only where the cakes void of very much fruit unless you want too count the raisons as fruit i will not be ordering clayton fruit cakes next year i can get the same results from a hostess fruit cake and only spend instead of close to dollars for the clayton cakes 
negative,27/2/19,claxton dark fruitcake has been a holiday tradition in our family since the mid s i ordered it directly from the company this year and when i served it at thanksgiving my guests and i thought i must have been fooled by a counterfeit website just claiming to sell claxton fruitcakes it was at best fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored cake i emailed the company and expressed my disappointment after several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners they assured me that it was the original dark recipe in reading the ingredients i noticed that corn syrup sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the ingredient at the very end were listed molasses spices and artificial food dyes high fructose corn syrup was not widely available until the mid s to mid s so i am not sure how it was one of the original ingredients all of the people i talked to seemed to have the attitude that i was so stupid that i could not possibly be observing what i had correctly although they offered to send replacements if i returned it at my own expense they told me that what i would receive would be identical to what i have one of the owners informed me that they had received zero complaints this year i am grieving the loss of an almost year tradition but the other cakes are now in the trash 
negative,19/4/20,aweful they arrived immediately and still were as hard as cement the bags supposed re sealable zipper did not re seal once and maybe the large amount had something to do with it but again i cannot believe how stale and terrible the candy inside was 
negative,17/4/20, get this type of sugar any other way than through ordering it because the shipping is insane the sugar is fine but for the price of the shipping it was not worth it 
negative,3/4/20,i bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep my dog hardly touched the stuff and then i looked at the ingredients one of the first things on it was corn a grain known to because allergies in dogs as a matter of fact corn might be the most allergy prone food amongst dogs not to mention thanks to our friends at monsanto it is almost always genetically modified gmo or a franken food unless it is organic real premium dog foods brag that they have no corn right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken by products another no no among real premium dog foods this means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it is not real meat cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it is cheap but it is not real meat a little further down you will notice bha an artificial preservative which again real premium dog foods do not have in short biljac is a joke it is basically insanely overpriced alpo with no organic ingredients whatsoever and uses all the shortcuts filler and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use do not be fooled by the old fashioned appeal of the company s years in business there is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap lousy ingredients calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a kia a mercedes for nearly the same price as this overpriced alpo one could buy organic dog food free of preservatives corn and cheap by products 
negative,7/8/19,i am celiac and have been keeping a strictly gluten free diet for over six years and was excited to learn about this product after eating it the taste and texture was not bad i became sick in the way that i always do when ingesting gluten nana s also makes non gluten products and clearly are not careful about cross contamination if you are concerned about ingesting gluten or keeping a strictly celiac diet i strongly recommend you avoid this product i also think that the company should not deceive their customers many who suffer from celiac disease and should more clearly label their product as it is a danger to the health of many who would be inclined to buy this product 
negative,9/3/18,the flavor is decent berry vanilla but i just cannot handle the texture it is like a mouthful of sawdust that just disintegrates when you bite into it i have been gluten free for about years and there are much better products out there my kids will not even eat these 
negative,18/5/18,like other reviewers i rarely eat cookies because i have an anaphylactic response to wheat gluten therefore i generally love any cookies i am not allergic to these are an exception the taste is mild and fleeting the texture is like sand and leaves a dry feeling in your mouth the only purpose these cookies are good for is dieting because they are simply inedible blah 
negative,27/1/19,i love the other nana s cookie bars and cookies so i thought i would give these a try even though they are no gluten and made with rice flour instead of wheat flour they look nice but the texture is a bit strange it is kind of like eating really fine sand and they are too dry and crumble at the slightest touch they do not taste bad which is a plus but i will not be buying these again 
negative,10/11/19,these are so gross i cannot believe i wasted my money on them they gave me an immediate migraine from the overwhelming artificial smelling fragrance i am not that picky an eater and i generally love any gf cookie just b c i am so grateful they exist but omg i immediately spit this out and rinsed out my mouth even my snack loving toddler did not like these eating them that is she did have a great time massaging it into a fine powder which takes almost no effort at all what a mess and what a waste of money 
negative,8/11/19,we have a gluten free household of no one in our family likes these my children are begging me to throw the box away i think they are afraid i will sneak one in their lunchbox the cookie crumbles leaving a dry mess of rice flour and hardish chewy fruity bits in your mouth have a glass of water nearby if you try these i hate to leave a bad review but there are way better gluten free options out there i will not throw the box away i will pass it on to another gluten free family i know and let them form their own opinion 
negative,25/10/21,i was disappointed in the unpleasant flavor and dry texture of nana s chocolate munch cookie bars to me there was an odd artificial almost chemical like after taste in them that cocoa powder cannot even cover up i threw away the entire box after tasting the first bar 
negative,8/5/20,tastes like dry brownie w invisible pieces of puffed rice which get stuck in your teeth come on we can do better than this for cookie bars

negative,29/7/19,this product is definitely not as good as some other gluten free cookies try pamela s 
negative,9/3/18,i know what you are probably thinking they are vegan they are gluten free they are a dream come true the taste of these bars is very banana y but i doubt you will be able to ignor the texture long enough to enjoy that the texture is akin to eating a handful of dirt i am no dirt eating pro but when i was trying to chew that is all i kept thinking please if you are thinking about trying these go down to your local natural foods market and pick up a box there first while you are at it you may want to get some of your favorite soymilk and lots of it ps if you are in the market for a yummy vegan bar try the betty lous brand the strawberry is super good 
negative,18/5/18,i bought a box waist d my but people love me that i could give them this after having a bough of having to rush to bathroom i re read the posts and looked at ingredients closer gluten free whole grain dextrins if you do not have a problem great if you do you may end up re reading the s later i like the idea of bites had them before going to try out pamela s i love the nana s cookies but it is very hard not to eat the whole cookie the nana s no gluten lemon cookie ounce cookies pack of nana s no gluten ginger cookie ounce packages pack of it is two servings plus the texture is soooo smooth it go s down very easy i do not have coffee or chocolate anymore have green tea decaf need to go to the nana s banana bars modify or delete my post only bites i hope pamela s ginger works out for me i do love this too lundberg eco farmed honey nut rice cake ounce units pack of lundberg eco farmed buttery caramel rice cake ounce units pack of lundberg eco farmed brown rice cake salt free ounce units pack of 
negative,17/5/20,be careful even though this is listed under gluten free section it is not gluten free
negative,26/3/20,after eating this product i had a stomach ache followed by hours on the toilet those of you with a gluten intolerance and celiac disease know exactly what those symptoms mean somehow this product is contaminated with gluten it is not gluten free please spare yourself the pain and suffering these cookies are not worth it for those of you who are tempted to continue eating this product even after you have been informed that it is not gluten free please keep these facts in mind if you eat gluten it damages your intestinal lining if you keep on eating gluten the damage to your intestines will get worse and so will your symptoms if you further continue to eat gluten you will end up in malabsorption increase your risk for intestinal cancer and lead to all sorts of problems including infertility autoimmune disorders oteoporosis in other words cheating on your diet is not worth it do not eat nana s products instead i suggest you buy something like pamela s chunky chocolate cookies they are one of my favorites 
negative,24/2/20,i was a bit disappointed in these they crumble very easily and have an unusual texture my son does not like them 
negative,3/5/19,i do not think i have ever eaten anything drier than these cookie bars ever in my life they taste okay but i just cannot choke them down even with coffee 
negative,27/3/20,this device s lid does not seal i am not sure why it is being sold as anything other than a trashcan did work well for beer as long as it was transferred to a secondary right at the end of fermentation

negative,13/1/20,my kids love these fruit roll ups and i remember having them as a child so i was delighted when i saw i could buy a large box however when they came we were disappointed the were were very old and hard we only opened one and it broke into pieces because it is a food item you cannot return which i think is ridiculous we could not even eat them i order lots of stuff from amazon and have had a great experience except for these fruit roll ups do not buy food from amazon the only reason i gave it star is because i had to click on something and they did arrive on time 
negative,21/9/20,we have two dogs and after a few weeks of switching to the beneful healthy weight we have noticed very unpleasant results they whine to go outside much more than they ever have and actually had bowel movements right in front of us if we do not get them outside in time our dogs have gone from needing to go outside a few times a day to or times daily to handle the number of bowel movements they have my theory is this dog food just goes right through the dog and not much of it actually is being utilized by the body which makes me wonder how many nutrients my dogs are actually receiving poor dog food in my opinion and should only be used if your dog needs a laxative i will most likely be going back to purina one 
negative,2/12/20,i have noticed that my dog has had more frequent bowel movement than usual he is on a strict schedule for potty break and has been very good on it for the past years until i tried this food now he poops in my apt in front of us because he has to go so bad like the poster above its one hell of a laxative when my very well trained yorkie cannot even hold it in
negative,20/11/19,i bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat and with a name like beneful i thought i was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food my dogs did eat this food but after reading the ingredients i completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs the first three ingredients are ground yellow corn chicken by product meal and corn gluten meal how disgusting is that the main ingredient is a corn filler one thing my vet told me a while back that i never forgot when you eat corn what comes out of the other end the same thing happens with dogs basically dogs cannot digest corn it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full poop out more and retain less nutrients the only meat in beneful at all is a by product its not even a real meat by products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested we are talking beaks chicken feet eyeballs even chicken poop i would not recommend this product to anyone for any reason ever it is an absolutely awful dog food i cannot believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising i recommend to stay far away from beneful and most purina products when purchasing a dog or cat food the most important thing to consider is the first ingredients just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself now that i know what to look for i usually buy my pets all natural organic foods such as blue buffalo halo or wellness 
negative,2/12/20,i started giving my dog this a couple of weeks ago he really loved a different beneful and so i gave this one a try he loves it and is excited when its time to eat he would barely touch purina little bites i took him out of state to my mom s place and he pooped in the house times i took the blame for not paying enough attention to him however since we have come back home he is pooped in my apt times in week he never does that i thought that maybe he was being spiteful but i really think he just cannot help it the food is one hell of a laxative if that is what you are looking for i am glad i only bought the small bag because i will not be giving this one another try it only gets stars because he likes it and because i am sure he would lose weight if he keeps pooping this much terrible 
negative,11/12/19,disappointed the big boxes had a very different flavor than the smaller boxes i am not sure why but not good 
negative,20/11/19,this is a really easy way to make terrible iced tea sometimes convenience outweighs taste but not always what this product does not tell you before you buy it is that the ingredients are black tea with tea extract hibiscus and citric acid it is not just tea and it does not taste like just tea either it tastes like powdered iced tea from a jar it has an overtaste of lemon that is probably the citric acid and that fake tea flavor that comes from powdered iced tea mix i will probably drink it when it is really convenient but i will not serve it to friends and i will not drink it if i have time to make a glass of real tea and pour it over ice 
negative,28/6/20,not a big fan will not buy this again plus she eats it really quick too other than the throw up part 
negative,8/8/20,the product was hard as a rock i could not even break it in half both dogs had hard time chewing them puppy could not either will not get product again unless the two packages i got were old and dried out 
negative,14/7/21,we have a year old pug who will eat just about anything but these unfortunately he just would not go near them no matter how hard we tried to peak his interest 
negative,2/12/20,i had high hopes for this product because it is healthy and affordable but neither of my chihuahuas liked it one just sniffed at it and walked away the other dog chewed on it for a short while and then walked away from it one dog likes nylabone nutri dent original minichews for mini dogs count pouch and the other dog likes bully sticks free range standard regular thick select inch pack by downtown pet supply i was looking for some alternatives that were healthy and more affordable i guess i will be sticking with their current treats for now 
negative,20/11/19,although some may like this drink it will not be a repeat buy for me calories for an oz serving is too much when that amount of orange juice is actually this drink is not orange tangerine juice but a mix of juices secondly if this were unaltered juice seems you would not have to add ascorbic acid to get of your daily vitamin c since that amount of orange juice naturally provides over perhaps the processing requires it but alas the biggest issue for me was taste it tasted to me like dishwashing liquid smells on the good side the carbonization is just right and the flavor is bold for those who seek that there is no sugar added and the non traditional taste is not overly sweet the taste may appeal to some but i am not a fan 
negative,1/3/21,yeah it is gluten free and whatever but unless that is a really big issue for you and you are having trouble finding sugary drinks to enjoy on your gluten free diet there is no real draw to this drink over say orange fanta or any number of other carbonated juice type drinks i thought it was massively overly sweet and i have something of a sweet tooth the orange flavor was not particularly authentic or delicious and it left a sour aftertaste i got a free sample this time and i cannot see actually paying money to buy this product again on an environmental note packaging and shipping these things in tiny little cans makes for more waste and i do not appreciate that either not a fan 
negative,5/5/21,switch is a tangy drink that is more reminiscent of sprite than orange juice it is carbonated all the way and you will even burp after it as you would have after consuming any soft drink the drink does not feel sugary but a quick glance at the nutritional facts reveals that each can contains grams of sugar the claim on the can is that there are no additional sugars added so i am assuming that is the sugar from the orange and tangerine the can
negative,2/12/20,i have become a fan of the switch sodas the black cherry flavor has a great balance of flavoring and carbonation that had me ready to give up traditional sodas the orange flavor however leaves a lot to be desired it has a really strong after taste and despite being juice it tastes like bad artificial orange flavoring i would opt for the grape or the black cherry for sure the switch black cherry ounce cans pack of also you will want to note that the switch sodas are not exactly healthy they are simply not overrun with artificial flavors they actually have a fairly high calorie count that being said they have some health benefits over pop like the vitamin count and no added sugars 
negative,20/11/19,i could not finish this drink it is like drinking orange syrup it may not have any added sugar in it but one can of ounces has sugar grams and carbs i will stick to water when i want to quench my thirst 
negative,9/10/21,this product advertises that it is a soda made from fruit juices and is refreshing i was quite disapointed in the flavor if you have ever been unfortunate enough to drink canned not refrigerated or fresh squeezed oj you know there is a huge differance in flavor the bad almost rotting component is carried over into this soda it even carries a rather odd aftertaste i was not able to finish the entire can this may be a feature of the orange flavor other fruit flavors of this product might indeed taste good but i recommend skilling the orange version 
negative,6/3/21,i did not find this drink anything special in terms of taste it is orange juice infused with carbonation the juice is quite acidic and you do not feel that there is fruit juice the drink comes in cans rather than glass bottle which would have helped the drink maintain the juicy taste longer it does not have any preservatives and it is gluten free no sugar and no artificial flavors this drink does not have any special features and it does not stand out well in a market crowded with many drinks izze fortified sparkling juice pomegranate ounce cans pack of minute maid mixed berry juice fl oz bottles fl oz cal valls certified organic juices clementine fluid ounce by igourmet com
negative,12/2/21,i have a tendency to avoid products with artificial sweeteners and this includes sodas with high fructose corn syrup the switch is a line of fruit juice sodas with no added sweeteners not even cane sugar it has carbonated water fruit juice some natural flavors and colors and vitamin c if you are going to drink soda carbonated fruit juice is the best way to go the switch has several flavors including orange tangerine however it is clear some flavors are better than others the orange tangerine has a harsh aftertaste that another flavor i tried does not i have tried other citrus juice sodas and enjoyed them but something went wrong in the flavoring of this particular soda if you are looking for an orangey soda try izze s sparking clementine instead 
negative,2/12/20,described as an alternative to soda switch is a carbonated fruit drink made from natural juices although not necessarily the ones listed as the flavor made mostly out of apple and grape juice the switch orange tangerine does in fact have an oversweet orange tangerine flavor followed by a strong vitamin aftertaste it tasted like drinking a soda made from crushed flintstone vitamins want a better carbonated fruit drink pour half a glass of orange juice and add club soda 
negative,20/11/19,i like the idea of a healthy soda type drink but this flavor just missed the mark the tangerine overpowered the orange and left a bad taste in my mouth carbonated juice is a great idea they just need to tweak the flavors a bit ranking the switch drinks from best to worst watermelon strawberry kiwi berry black cherry orange tangerine
negative,25/6/21,the can says it is juice but the taste is powdery if you have ever had a glass of kool aid or crystal light you will know what i mean so there is that from powder taste also there is an aftertaste and all comes in a can the size of a red bull for calories i did not like it 
negative,17/3/20,i am a fan of all natural anything especially when it is a tasty and healthy alternative to something i have enjoyed my whole life but i know is bad for me regular soda is one of those bad things loaded with artificial colors sweeteners corn syrup yuck hardly seems worth the risk when i am also getting empty calories on average and now switch has come along true to its claim there is nothing artificial in it just juice sparkling water and other natural ingredients that is great so i chose this particular flavor orange tangerine because i wanted the strong citrus taste i love this drink however failed to meet their promise yes i can taste the orangy citrus but as much i can taste the apple and grape juices used as well moreover this does not have that bold pop to it as other carbonated beverages have i have had mineral water with more bite but the worse part about this good for me drink is in clocks in at calories the same as a regular can of coke and sugar compared with coke at on the up side it has less than half the sodium as many regular colas and does deliver vit c and vit a but if i wanted those kind of health benefits i would rather take them directly from the source an orange overall the all natural health pros of switch orange tangerine simply do not justify the high calorie and carb count the switch beverage co may have done better to sell sparkling water with a twist of orange peel if they wanted to provide a truly healthy alternative to traditional sodas 
negative,20/10/21,i have a big sweet tooth and thought i would really like this but it was too sweet even for me i even tried adding water but that did not help i have not tried any of the other flavors so i cannot comment on the brand in general but i will never try this flavor again 
negative,21/7/20,if you think this is going to be a healthy product you are sadly mistaken it still contains of sugar per can if you want to end up a fat diabetic by all means try it otherwise try the zero calorie zero sugar zero chemical naturally fruit flavored seltzers like those by la croix 
negative,22/2/21,these are definitely not worth close to a dollar a piece if they were at my local grocery i might give twenty to thirty cents per can for them i did not really like the flavor that well but if you did they might even worth up to fifty cents per can otherwise pass these up 
negative,8/6/21,this had a nice citrus flavor but it was too sweet and actually flat i did not get any kind of fizz or sparkle for the amount of sugar and calories i rather would have eaten a piece of fruit and drank a glass of seltzer water less calories and more satisfying in my mouth i got this on gb special for about for the case i do not think i will purchase again 
negative,2/12/20,i have tried other flavors of switch carbonated juice drinks and have enjoyed them however this particular flavor of orange tangerine was way too sweet i felt like i was drinking some sort of carbonated orange ade drink and could barely get it down while i would probably purchase the other flavors of switch i definitely would not purchase this one 
negative,20/11/19,i was anxious to try this but upon the first sip it was apparent to me that this drink was not going to go well for me it has a very sharp harsh citrus y metallic flavor and combined with the overwhelming sweetness the two seem to battle it out in my mouth for dominance after awhile it seemed like the drink was going down more like syrup more than a carbonated beverage the can is small at oz a regular sized pop can is oz and the cost of these little guys seem a little bit astronomical i also am a bit dubious of its attempts to seem like a healthy alternative to pop it still has loads of sugar in it so when they claim no additional sugar this may lead you to believe no sugar or low sugar but it does in fact have grams 
negative,25/1/21,to me fruit juice in small cans are simply a staple first example that comes to mind is good old dole pineapple juice the trend towards trendy little health beverages in overpriced little cans is nearly tragic there is nothing about this product that would compel me to buy it if i want a soda i will just grab one i do not drink enough of them to have much dietary impact and despite the claim of what you want there is nothing in here for me if i want of what i want i will buy a few oranges and some seltzer water if i want of what you do not want well why buy it this is a time when we had better look pretty closely at what is an indulgent convenience and what is a necessity and how to find a happy medium i consider the likes of pellegrino aranciata orangina and izze a luxury and when i indulge it is a true delight switch is a product that is not better tasting proven healthier or even less expensive than any of many other alternatives once again marketing is driving product creation and design and that is a hateful concept if you want a similar taste experience for about the same price pick up some alka seltzer cold plus nighttime you will stop sneezing and sniffling and get a great night s sleep 
negative,1/7/21,pros not overly sweet like some juice drinks no caffeine no corn sweeteners if that matters to you cons expensive for the size ounces cannot taste the orange or tangerine juices in it lots of calories i grew up eating oranges and tangerines off my grandparents trees i was surprised that i could not taste those flavors in this drink but then i looked at the ingredient list on the can and those were the juices that were used in the smallest amounts probably to keep the cost down i will stick to the sobe low cal drinks and the calorie vitamin water because they are cheaper and i would rather save up my daily allotment of calories for something with more flavor 
negative,30/9/20,i grew up on orange sodas and thought this might be like a healthy crush that would be a no of course tangerine has a bit of a different taste than orange as it is that much sweeter adding the carbonation to it just made it an unappealing fizzy ultra sweet drink not unlike cough syrup proceed with caution perhaps kids would find it super tasty 
negative,15/3/20,i did not like this drink at all it had a very strange almost chemically taste to it i also did not appreciate switch marketing itself as all natural but had ingredients like natural flavors and colors what are they are they even natural i even let my three year old try it but she could not even swallow it and spit it out in the sink too bad it would have been a good alternative to sodas but not with this horrible taste my daughter and i much prefer the ooba hibiscus drink 
negative,6/7/21,i wrote a star review of the kiwi berry flavor that is not usually my favorite flavor of anything but it was surprisingly good orange tangerine which would generally be among my first picks of fruit flavored beverages is flat by comparison literally it seemed to lack the right amount of carbonation it also tastes weaker and too sweet try the kiwi berry instead 
negative,29/6/21,i thought it would have a clean crisp taste but it honestly tasted just like every other orange soda i have ever had maybe that is deliberate maybe they are targeting people who would otherwise drink orange soda unless presented with a more natural alternative regardless it tastes exactly like carbonated reconstituted juice concentrates with some orange coloring thrown into the mix i e nothing special 
negative,29/6/21,the carbonation in this drink was way too much so much in fact that it over powered the flavor orange tangerine is usually very good together i expect this from a soda but not a healthy drink lose some of that club soda bite and you have one delicious drink until then i will pass 
negative,26/7/21,this drink is very very sweet and only mildly carbonated i do not drink soda but i do occasionally like bubbles in my drinks i had some hope that switch would be a nice bubbly fruit drink to fill this need but it is not the ingredients may be all natural but it is still syrupy and has an odd aftertaste that i think is from the added vitamin c for regular soda drinkers the sweetness may not be as offensive but for anyone expecting something that tastes like sparkling fruit juice this will be a disappointment i would still choose this over an orange soda but i would choose to have nothing at all rather than this also note that the cans are only ounces each smaller than normal soda cans 
negative,21/10/21,while orange juice is the fourth ingredient in this drink the dominant flavor is a muddy orange which is backed up by a low level of carbonation i think that the use of the inexpensive apple and white grape juices as the first two ingredients tangerine is third is what results in the unpleasant muddied orange taste finally they threw in a bit of acerola juice but to no avail to my taste this stuff is suprisingly unpalatable while the marketing suggestion is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely natural sugar in this or most any juice the healthy alterative to overly sugared fruit juices is to have a glass of cold water and a piece of fresh fruit fruit has less calories than juice but overall more vitamins minerals and fiber and a variety of natural antioxidants that most likely really are good for you 
negative,25/10/21,well my husband myself and my year old son sampled this drink my husband hated it i felt like it was ok but nothing to write home about the taste to me was too orangey and for a natural product it sure did not taste like one my year old liked it he also likes gummy worms and sour straws so you can take his review for what it is i personally would not buy this product stars
negative,29/6/21,ouch this stuff is sweet as in really sweet this is really harsh tasting and we were disappointed most soda does not have this much sugar the oz can has grams of sugar yikes for a oz can of soda that would be like having grams of sugar who would drink that they need to water this way down we are going to end up giving the rest of this away we cannot drink it 
negative,5/7/21,when i saw the switch orange tangerine was available i knew i had to try it i liked the kiwi strawberry quite well better than some other reviewers did it seems so i was sure i would enjoy this one just as much the initial taste of this orange tangerine carbonated juice is rather tart and the carbonation just seems to make it more tart the aftertaste is rather pleasant so if the aftertaste is what you are looking for in a drink this is the drink for you my wife thought it tasted a bit like champagne if that is any indication of what to expect from this drink the flavor is different and not at all what i expected not very refreshing at all i would buy the kiwi berry drink but i think i will take a pass on the orange tangerine in the future 
negative,17/9/21,this was the most potent orange drink i have ever had it might be juice but this drink has some kick there are no artificial sweeteners in this drink but it is so highly concentrated that it was overwhelmingly sweet and even the tang of the carbonation could not cute into the sugary flavor it was way too strong for me and i thought it had kind of an odd aftertaste but if you like carbonation and have a powerful craving for orange tangerine this is the drink for you 
negative,18/8/21,these seemed like a great idea i would be able to load up k cups with any type of coffee i chose and still maintain the speed of using the store bought cups in my rush to get ready every morning after waiting a month for this product to reach me days before they even shipped it i finally found it on my doorstep upon opening the box my hopes lifted even higher these are solid little cups of a much higher quality than i expected i filled one and snapped the lid down i ensured it was sealed all the way around placed it in my kuerig and hit the brew button at first it seemed to be working splendidly then coffee began pouring out of places it is not supposed to by the time it was over i had quite a mess to clean up upon opening the kuerig i found the disposakup completely in tact and the lid still secured properly however the bit of overhanging filter was soaked dripping and hot i had discovered the source of the leak i have tried again several times with the same reoccurring problem i guess i should have bought the ecobrew cup after all if you like the appearance of convenience and the reality of spending more time cleaning up a mess this is the product for you i went ahead and gave it two stars because i like the idea of the product so much 
negative,31/7/21,caused my cuisinart k cup brewer to leak every time i used it great idea just needs some adjustments so that the coffee maker works properly with it 
negative,18/10/21,the lids do not fit coffee runs out of the pod a total waste of money there are other filters on the market that are much better 
negative,29/6/21,i will start by being kind it is a good idea to save money with an item or concept like this it makes good sense to use your own coffee beans and avoid the cost of the pre filled commercial k cups you buy at the store now i received my disposakups over a month after ordering them and put them to use i was immediately disappointed filters did not hold very much coffee it was a struggle to get the lids to fit together with the filter and outer plastic cup the coffee was very weak this product actually creates more waste in a landfill than the commercially made k cups the body and lids are plastic normal k cups do not have a plastic lid notice they say disposable so put them in the trash they are not recyclable landfill they are not convenient they are a bit messy a pain to put together and still expensive not worth it there are better alternatives out there that will save you money make better coffee and not go into a landfill sorry i wish i had better news i think i will return these 
negative,16/9/21,for product to work properly imho you need coffee ground as fine as possible once filter has been inserted plave carefully leveled measure of coffee in it manuever lid into place then press down on center steadily w thumb plan to use no more than oz of water for your cup removal of used cup from machine is occasional problem jiggle it and it will generally loosen up 
negative,24/8/21,the products lid stays attached to the needle on the keurig allowing coffee grounds to fall everywhere very messy if this did not happen it would work well 
negative,24/6/21,these cups were difficult to cap putting the lids on securely was a comedy show and they created a mess when used in the keurig the water went everywhere add together pia and mess with an end outcome of weak cup of joe i am not a very happy buyer 
negative,27/9/21,the lids are impossible to secure this purchase was a complete waste of money product cannot be used as lids are unable to be secured 
negative,29/6/21,i ordered the disposa kups with the thought of making my own kups they do not fit together without a big production the lids will not fit and water comes out the top of the brewer lid as well as the kcup just a big mess not what i wanted at all want to return them and get a refund donna phillips
negative,5/8/21,first of all i thought i could save money filling my own keurig k cups by the time i bought the fillable cups paid shipping and bought coffee to put in them i was already in the hole if all you have to do is fill these little cups all day i guess it will work for you because you can have the coffee of your choice the other problem was is they get stuck in the brewer when you try to take them out i still have about thirty left and when they are gone i will not replace them 
negative,29/6/21,i thought these would be the perfect answer sadly i guess the pressure with which my keurig machine shoots the water through the k cup is too much for the disposa cup because every single time i tried it coffee grounds were spewed up through the tiny hole in the lid of the disposa cup all over the inside of where the k cup sits in my keurig and yes i used them properly so the issue at least in my keurig machine seems to be with the lids some have suggested its a design flaw with the keurig machine in either case these disposa cups were not the answer for me biggest waste of money ever i cannot recommend 
negative,31/7/21,the service and delivery from amazon was great however the product itself is not worth buying no matter what i try coffee leaks out around the kcup when brewing it makes a mess wanted the cups to use my favorite coffee tim hortons but guess i will just have to get used to other brands 
negative,11/9/21,the lids keep popping off when the cup fills up with water the only i have not tried is putting holes in bottom of the cup so that the water might flow out faster it is a damn mess getting coffee grounds in your cup i would not buy anymore of them unless i can fix the problem no more disposebale k cups for me 
negative,12/8/21,i was anxious to try these cups since they seemed to be sealed like the original k cups but was very disappointed in the product though the cups came with no instructions it was apparent that you just put the filter in add coffee then pop the lid on trouble is the filters size and shape indicate they should hang over the outside edge of the cup but when doing that i found it impossible to seal the cups so i had to tuck the filter inside to be able to close and seal the lid after doing that and trying the coffee ran very slow though the k cup and after only about three cups the keurig machine seemed to get clogged up and stop working i cleaned out with vinegar and tried again but same result i ended up throwing these away as it did not seem worth the effort to return them not a good product 
negative,31/7/20,these k cups have damaged something causing the water to not come through my already made k cups i now have to put a ready made in and puncture it then open it and turn the k cup and puncture it again for the water to come through i think the material in the disposable k cup is too heavy and damages the needle on the bottom 
negative,13/6/20,the basic problem with this product is that unless you load a very small amount of coffee in the filter the filter clogs this causes the coffee ground and hot water to back up through the hole in the top and because a mess my son and i spent a few hours experimenting with different ways to prevent this but we have admitted defeat i suspected the filter but i used filters which work perfectly fine in my ez cup still result in a mess on my kitchen counter even worse coffee grounds in my coffee however if you like your coffee very weak this will work well for you i hope they can fix the design issues until then i will stick with my ez cup 
negative,31/7/20,thought this might be a nice alternative to use with my favorite coffee but was sadly disappointed it leaked all over no matter what we tried and the coffee was weak machine clogged with most attempts and water would not brew thru at times the cup even melted a little leaving a nasty taste in the coffee go with the greener alternative and try the ekobrew much better results and no waste 
negative,13/6/20,i purchased this item as an alternative to traditional k cups in an attempt to save money however this product did not work well in my machine i followed the directions and read reviews to see what works best but was not able to use the k cups effectively the cup itself is too weak and warps in my machine i compared the shape before and after and there is a big difference this k cup seems to expand horizontally and vertically because the plastic is not strong enough also the k cup is shaped differently from the traditional k cup this is neccessary because it does not use foil as a topper but does not seem to work in the end i had to clean up several coffee explosions in my kitchen to figure out how it works but still could not use it effectively maybe i am not doing something correctly but i am sure there is also an issue with the product itself while i do like the idea i would not suggest purchasing this product until the bugs are worked out 
negative,26/9/20,well at least they live up to their name these nuts are definitely hot too bad that is all the positive i have to say about them other than that they taste like cardboard and not very good cardboard either 
negative,17/10/20,made in china even our dog food has gone the way of the hershey kiss i will not be back to this vendor will be looking for made and sold in america only 
negative,14/12/20,i eat mixed nuts all the time at work they make a healthy snack instead of the donuts etc that are always around the plus side of these is that they are much lower salt than usual the down side is that they are almost all cashews very few brazil nuts pecans and it is a miracle to find a macadamia nut the lack of variety is disappointing 
negative,29/5/20,the price was comparable to walmart for same size product however these nuts were not as crunchy and they needed a little more salt 
negative,9/12/20,i would recommend not buying these nuts if you are looking for some really good tasting nuts these are just average quality and the brazil nuts taste just plain awful the only good tasting nut in this lot is the almond and pecans there are barely any pecans but tons of cashews try another brand as i am sure there is something better out there 
negative,4/8/20,these are a cheap fake nothing like the real emerald nuts you buy in the store its a complete waste of money do not get ripped off like i did 
negative,31/7/20,good quality product but you would have to really love curry flavor to like these they are so awful i do not know what to do with them but i know i will not be eating them i will stick to the plain sea salt ones 
negative,13/6/20,unfortunately i am completely disappointed with this product i have an above average sense of smell but this extract has hardly any detectable flavor in the bottle and none whatsoever once added to food perhaps i received part of a faulty batch the seller is letting me return the bottle but is requiring that i pay for shipping again so i would be very unlikely to order from them again 
negative,21/11/20,lacks the flavor i was hoping for and the price was a bit high for the satisfaction level i will not be ordering this again live and learn 
negative,25/5/21,all of the positive reviews led me to believe this popcorn was going to be really great truth is i am disappointed the popcorn kernels are tough chewy and lack any great corn taste i want popcorn that snaps when you bite into it i will go back to buying the premium orville redenbacher s brand at my local grocery 
negative,25/5/21,so far i am not impressed with this popcorn it is tender when popped but it is really annoying how much does not pop i am going to add a little water and then let it sit closed up for a while and see if that helps as of right now i would not buy this popcorn again 
negative,20/1/21,these are supposed to be cherry and brandy filled chocolates if they contain brandy it is too subtle for me to detect a clue to the because may be the stickiness of the package and the cracks in the candies it appears they were mistreated at some point and may have leaked but the box they came in shows no damage a friend speculated that airline decompression burst them maybe but other imported chocolates do not suffer this problem i should also mention that the chocolate tastes a little bit dusty on the outside i cannot really recommend these laroshell candies there are other brands which are quite good 
negative,15/1/21,i do like the idea of these crackers for gluten free eating but i cannot bring myself to enjoy them i bought the pack variety and have tried the maple cinnamon and the onion garlic i generally like flax but these just are not setting well with me even when i use them as a carrier for dips i feel i wasted my money i will probably give the unopened packs to a friend s family that are gluten free 
negative,8/2/21,i bought a bottle of tapatio hot sauce for my friend to have it shipped over to her in the east coast the order said it would take business days it ended up taking over weeks
negative,10/2/21,i bought this item thinking it might be equivilent to starbucks or davinci hazelnut syrup but it is not at first it tastes like hazelnut then you get the flavor of cheap pancake syrup followed by an aftertaste that can best be described as tasting stale the price is only slightly better than what i can get the davinci brand at sam s club but the quality is far lower in my opinion for hazelnut fans i suggest avoiding this particular brand 
negative,9/10/20,i am sorry i bought this brand it leaves a lousy after taste in your mouth no wonder amazon is giving shipping on this item stay away avoid 
negative,31/7/20,the flavor of big train hazelnut is not significant one has to add a lot to have a flavor impact of the three big train flavors i purchased including vanilla and irish creme hazelnut is the least satisfactory vanilla s a little better irish creme is best i gave that one stars 
negative,13/6/20,very disappointed not much pumpkin or spice just pretty close to plain old coffee i was hoping for something like they have at tim horton s but its not even close 
negative,5/12/20,the ones i received were mostly yellowish in color with some light green instead of dark green dry and somewhat stale they may have been in a warehouse longer that they should have 
negative,1/11/20,i ordered the month ice cream of the month club for my wife s birthday she received her first shipment today and none of the ice creams that were sent matched the sheet they included explaining the ice creams you could have bought several of the ice creams such as butter pecan or mint chocolate chip in your local grocery store when i called the number i was told that occasionally they reserve the right to change the ice cream if it does not meet their quality guidelines when i told her none of the four ice creams that we received matched the overview sheet from amazingclubs the customer service rep was rude and told me that i needed to call back and talk to someone in their support group note you must call before pm est to speak to someone in this group i would seriously caution you to she will out more than for this club 
negative,14/1/21,this is simply a mix of brown sugar and splenda i am sure it would be cheaper to make your own
negative,6/6/21,these are not black winter truffles tuber melanosporum i thought the price was too good to be true even though they are not fresh and it is these are tuber indicums it says so right on the label i was very angry about this but jr mushrooms has said they will refund me for the truffles and even let me keep them so i give jr credit for excellent responsiveness and customer service although i still feel they should not be labeled black winter truffles 
negative,21/7/20,i though this product lack flavor as i taste different brands far better there were no real flavor as i expected sorry
negative,5/1/21,we tried these and they were bland and had no redeeming qualities we sauteed them slightly and also tried them as is shaved the price as some have mentioned reflects what you get for truffles spend your money on white truffle oil you will be much happier we are also wait for the white truffles to come in from italy i would not knock jr as a company but would not recommend this offering 
negative,23/1/21,i ordered this in the past and was extremely disappointed they are unlike truffles that i know of they were hard like a huge seed had no truffle aroma i threw all contents out will never order them again
negative,31/7/20,i should have listened to the negative reviews but hoped that the positive reviews would ring more true there was veery little truffle flavor that got entirely lost in the risotto i made i agree with the other reviewers in that this was woody and flavorless not worth even this price for truffles 
negative,13/6/20,little lesson on truffles truffles graded extra are larger than most the second highest in truffle quality best when used at the conclusion of the cooking process to release all their aroma and perfume chefs suggest to slice or shave thinly over pastas risottos and omelets whole entire truffles are marked brushed which means they have been cleaned of any soil or dirt preserved in brine or truffle juice which can be discarded or use to flavor sauced or broths and are ready to use preserved truffles are a nice budget friendly way to add visual truffle appeal to dishes however if you are looking to add the pungent aroma and taste of truffles to your dish chefs recommend that you explore fresh truffle selections jarred or canned truffles sold by vendors are mere shadows of their fresh truffle selves and will not by themselves deliver the aroma or flavor of fresh truffles they are great to use with truffle oil the oil will add the flavor the preserved truffles the truffle look but preserved truffles should be used only to garnish a dish or in conjunction to truffle butter and oil during those times when fresh truffles are out of season or when the budget does not allow for the real thing note preserved truffles out of the jar or can have almost no flavor or odor if you are looking for the true flavor of a fresh truffle then please go to seek fresh truffle pages online and purchase a fresh truffle if you are looking to add a truffle look only to your dish then this is the product for you better to buy real truffle oil experiment for example jr mushrooms specialties on amazon is a good start about dollars is low commitment that is in line with a superior bottle of extra virgin olive oil evoo 
negative,1/12/20,zero stars for this item i could not even confirm that the wrinkled little animal offal sort of thing is a truffle this lacks any aromatic attraction at all i would be afraid to put it in anything i planned to eat for fear it would ruin the entire item as for the famous jr service my complaints about this product have been ignored 
negative,30/1/21,i am the biggest fan of mushrooms you will ever meet but these are really disgusting they taste like dirt i have to imagine better quality truffles if these are even truffles at all are muuuuch better they would have to be there would be no comparison these are really bad 
negative,1/1/21,these truffles are not as great as they are made up to be i thought for the price they would have a greater taste but they did not have much taste at all they are not worth the price but had to find out for myself i will not be buying truffles again and i am not going to spend over for a fresh one 
negative,11/1/21,this is the worst flavored coffee i have ever tried there is no aroma or flavor of chocolate raspberry to this coffee bean at all in fact the coffee tastes sour i too am sorry i could not buy just lb to try it first now i am stuck with this awful coffee i cannot return so buyer beware no returns 
negative,31/7/20,check out the nutritional info the sodium grams of your daily requirement i used this and our casserole was ruined because it was so salty and what is up with that price my box cost a dollar unfortunately i bought two boxes so i am throwing the other box away no bargain here it is wildly un delicious and un healthy for you yeah i am embarrassed that i did not read the label first 
negative,13/6/20,the product was okay but the color was very different than advertised it was a darker pink not red at all i tried to use it a couple different ways and as a relative beginner i did not find the product easy to use i tried mixing in with a little vanilla extract in order to paint it on i had read this was the best way to do it i found that the painting was very streaked and not very consistent maybe someone more experienced will be able to use it more effectively in the end because the red color was important for the cake i mixed it with red food coloring instead of vanilla extract the pearl dust used this way had just a little impact on the color not a great deal in the end i would have experimented more on the best way to use it if the color had been more red but as was i did not find it super useful and will be unlikely to purchase again i hope that other people have a better experience as i very much like the idea of the product 
negative,14/1/21,i have placed two orders for the weber grill grinder roasted garlic herb in the past i was so disappointing the last time i picked up my order as it was not what i had ordered it was citrus twist with garlic i just love the garlic and herb grinder and have given my first order away to my family as christmas gifts i now do not even have one bottle for myself you can see i have reordered the garlic herb and hope i will receive what i have ordered it would be so inconvenient to repackage and return if it was possible to buy it in my location i would but it is not available very disappointed leona the order that i received with the citus garlic was as follows transaction date location amount reference number description amazon com amzn com billwa
negative,7/12/20,second time i have reported this one jar broken and order not what pictured jam same but jar different i know my ginger this not same 
negative,5/5/21,tastes burnt roasted slightly rotten sunflower seed taste gritty bland no salt sugar only seeds would not eat if it was free 
negative,23/11/20,this is twice as expensive as basic box mac and cheese it is just so so in taste if you check the ingredients it is not much different than other mac and cheese the cost does not justify the ordering i will not be ordering from amazon again the cost is much cheaper at a big box chain 
negative,29/8/20,i have been disappointed with this product we have always enjoyed annie s products have never had a problem until now the cheese was so solidly clumped that i was unable to make a sauce without lumps i have used different packages from my order have had the problem with all of them i am not sure if it is the result of a manufacturing issue or if they have been sitting on a shelf too long in the warehouse either way beware 
negative,18/1/21,i love annie s but this had no taste very bland and unappealing i would not purchase this again but worst of all i am stuck with boxes boo 
negative,18/6/21,i bought a new bread machine and bought this collection of bread mixes as well as some single mixes to try it out the single mixes worked well as they included yeast packaged separately in the mix my machine states clearly not to get the yeast wet to put it on top of the flour away from the water the mixes in this collection have the yeast in the flour not packaged separately the bread failed to rise at all why would they package the yeast separately in the single mixes and not in the multi packs along with the heartland collection i also purchased the baker s choice collection i am throwing them all out do not waste your money 
negative,18/6/21,the bread has a good taste but does not rise properly and only makes loaf i checked the temp of the water as suggested with bad results after raising the temp to degrees i got it to rise to loaf pretty expensive for the quality and i will not buy again 
negative,7/7/21,i bought this because the ingredients seem to be ok but for some reason it made my dogs have to go outside at least times each night overnight for the weeks we gave this to them we changed back to origen a food they do well on and the middle of the night bathroom trips stopped in days also my older dog tends to get really diggy when she is eating something not good for her and with this food she was constantly digging at the couch i have no idea what is wrong with this food none of the ingredients stand out to me as being the because but something in it really messed my puggies up 
negative,18/6/21,the problem with this peanut butter is the use of evaporated cane juice which is a coy way of saying raw sugar accent on the sugar the sugar is gritty and overpowers the peanut taste and the maple it was not very maple y it was gritty sweet and pretty much not great maybe the cane juice crystallized to the low moisture content of peanut butter anyway it was a loser i had heard much hype about this peanut butter started by someone who has a peanut butter sandwich restaurant in new york i happen to like pbj and celery with pb a tablespoon of peanut butter is a fairly good snack even if you are watching your food intake but this peanut butter is too sugary for my tastes i gave it two stars if you are making a confection or cookies it could be very good but as eat alone peanut butter i found it way too sweet and gritty for my tastes 
negative,7/7/21,i just received the plant i paid extra for a quick delivery to secure the plant s condition it arrived on time however it arrived wrapped only in moist news paper without any protection for the plant the plant is completely smashed this was for me a complete waste of my time and money i paid more for shipping than for the item itself and it did not do a bit of good very disappointing 
negative,1/7/21,this plant appears to be dead on arrival i have had in full sun since arrival and its leaves and stems are pink and not growing at all ide order another one but it will probably die in the slow shipping as well for a dead weed no thanks they would not let me submit this review with out clicking a star not even worth one star note the picture they used for this product has six more branches than mine i have three
negative,7/7/21,ordered this plant to remedy a fruit fly invasion the amazon shipping was acceptable but the manufacturer does not create the packaging to facilitate any shipment unless they were to put this side up on the box the dirt was everywhere but where it was supposed to be and the plant audrey was upside down roots up in the box if i had found one locally i would have bought it there hoping audrey survives but i do not have high hopes edit audrey is now deceased do not recommend 
negative,23/7/21,plant was dead on arrival and was mangled in its container probably better to buy one locally i do not think its going to make it 
negative,20/7/21,the plant was upside down in the box and i had to put the roots back inside the planter it never came out of shock and turned black and died 
negative,19/7/21,i had a second plant to replace the first one it to came in sad shape i should of went to a local nursery at least then i would of got a good plant do not waste your time with this vender 
negative,18/6/21,the plant arrived dead it cost as much to ship i did not want to hassle with any kind of return i should know better than to buy a plant on line 
negative,7/7/21,i received an undersized sickly plant that could not be nurtured back to health what was i thinking ordering a plant over the internet never again 
negative,27/6/21,it only lasted days came mostly dead glad it was only bucks it was also very small so the flies i wanted it to eat it could not 
negative,21/7/21,two of the three plants were dying and are now dead they all were tiny they are suppose to catch flies but not one fly has been caught because they could not even fit in the bloom rip off do not do business with this vendor 
negative,18/6/21,i do not know how people could say this does not smell or taste bad it is horrible i was getting raw goat s milk for quite a while and when we moved it was not available the fresh raw milk was delicious and mild and did not have that gamey odor and flavor that this milk has maybe some people do not mind the taste maybe some acquire a taste for it and maybe some even like it but i think it is vile if you like the taste of the goat s milk cheese in stores then you may like this if not stay far far away 
negative,7/7/21,the last shipment i received when preparing the milk there were black specks or particles in it it was in two out of the three containers i do not even know if it was in the first can i used this was the first time it is happened and i have been using goats milk for my daughter since december and she loves it plus it did not constipated her like whole cow s milk now i am leary about buying another batch as it may contain this stuff again 
negative,30/6/21,too bad this stuff in general ranks high on the inflammation triggering foods i am trying to follow a low inflammation diet i do love the taste of goats milk it is very rich and creamy the liquid is better than the powder 
negative,1/7/21, for boxes is this a rare item that is a box i think the item might be a bit overpriced 
negative,24/8/21,i ordered two can packs of oz v juice which were boxed together and filled with inflated plastic to buffer when i opened the box although all the flip tabs appeared to be intact one can had leaked some of it is contents and the juice was all over the other cans and inside the box i weighed the cans to find out which one s had leaked and that is how i determined which one to throw away the weight of the cans varied but the variance was consistent except one can was a few ounces short i am hoping it was just from the one can and i do not turn up with salmonella down the road since this was a ups delivery i am kind of surprised that amount of pressure was put on this package usually get superior service from them i have ordered like this in the past and the product arrived in perfect condition so as i said i was disappointed this time 
negative,21/7/21,i got this in the mail nice packaging and all opened it up to see its single serving bags of hot water to a bag not gallon size so i decided to make some and it tasted like the little pink bubble gum double bubble i used to get as a kid yuck so not what i was expecting 
negative,25/6/21,i did not order because it does not indicate anywhere what size the bottle is i think that is basic information maybe you should include that in your description
negative,13/9/21,wolfgang puck recently changed their chicken soup the old stuff is excellent the new stuff is watered down not filling and does not taste as good the image and description on this item stated that it was the old soup the soup i received is the new stuff being a food item returns are not allowed i feel this was false advertizing and am extremely displeased 
negative,18/6/21,this soup has no flavor broth had a slimy consistency instead of a liquid y one i was so disappointed 
negative,7/7/21,this soup is just offensive why does it taste like cinnamon also it is twice the price of campbell s and the chicken sure it says it is organic i totally believe that do not you 
negative,15/7/21,i found this exact same product same size at our local grocery store qfc and safeway for so am not sure why this product is priced so much higher 
negative,11/7/21,the tree is nice but that is the only part besides the pot did not come with a matching drip tray as promised instructions were lacking information and were merely a printed piece of paper 
negative,7/10/21,what is in this stuff where is the list of ingredients i do not eat anything unless i know and approve of what is in it for example although this product s description says it contains no sugar it does not say if it contains any artificial sweeteners which are also bad for you for one thing aside from tasting awful artificial sweeteners often because horrendous intestinal cramps and diarrhea in addition to having long ago given up the eating of sugar and sugar in all its guises e g natural cane juice fruit juices raw sugar organic sugar etc i also stopped ingesting artificial sweeteners of any kind so what is in this stuff 
negative,6/7/21,i have tried many different protein powders over the years and while it is hard to write a review based on taste alone since everyone is taste is different i am going to go ahead and say this is the most rancid tasting gunk i have ever had the displeasure of putting in my mouth i mix my protein shakes with a hand blender so i rarely have any mixing problems and even this protein mixed well the fun really began when i tasted it it tastes sour and acrid at the same time absolutely horrendous i could not finish the shake i had mixed up and had to wash my mouth out with apple juice to get that sick taste out before i could actually eat or drink anything else this is a terrible protein powder from the standpoint of taste in my opinion of all the types i have tried which is many this has taken seat as the new worst one fyi i had ordered this with another brand because i am testing egg protein powders due to casein sensitivity if anyone has an egg protein powder recommendation pm me 
negative,18/6/21,so after comparing this to jay robb i can say that this protein is not as good the taste is not as good and it does not mix that easy i do not think it is horrible just not that good one thing i like about the jay robb is that they use hormone free chicken eggs i sent healty n fit an email asking where they get their eggs from but they did not reply it is a little cheaper but i found the jay robb at vitamin shoppe for per which is not bad i have to say that i do not like the dudes picture on the bottle but that is my only complaint 
negative,7/7/21,the protein powder is ok not to good as i expected if you pour hot milk over it will will form substance like egg white which is very bad in taste not at all drinkable 
negative,27/7/21,i used this product cod roe tarako spaghetti sauce to eat when i feel lazy at japan that very cheap and just boil pasta and mix this pouch because i ate that product once a week in japan after i moved here america year ago i really miss some asian food because little expensive but when i see picture i remind how good and excited because i bought this from amazon but taste little different i was disappointed too strong smell like a ocean i throw garbage because i did not remember product of japan america i never ever buy this in america 
negative,13/7/21,this sounded so tasty from the reviews and the flavors were enticing so i ordered some we had some for breakfast today and then went to pack the other boxes in bags to go to the homeless shelter to us it is dreadful it has the texture of paste and not even palatable for us am throwing out the box we opened and canceling my order on subscribe and save when you consider how easy it is to make real oatmeal i am sorry i was fooled by these flavors 
negative,13/9/21,i used quotes around the word tea because i doubt that the bags contain tea i would not be surprised if the bags contained ground up sticks instead of tea i would not give this product a single star it deserves zero stars in my opinion this tool is not allowing me to continue without giving the product at least one star 
negative,7/9/21,the grains make this food really flakey it just does not stick together and was falling off the spoon a major mess really it also does not have a zip lock top and i thought it did like many of the other pouch foods and took this with us out to dinner i ended up putting the leftovers in a plastic baggie my baby also was not a fan of this at all and she is not a picky eater even my dogs turned their nose up at it and i thought it tasted pretty nasty 
negative,17/4/21,sent this to my mother to help her out with groceries since she is on a fixed income she said it was horrible and would be throwing the other boxes out so i would not reccomend this product 
negative,10/3/21,i had pretty high hopes for the busy bone i have a large active chewer the kind of dog that has to have several bones to choose from all the time if you do not want her to chew up your bed frame i was hoping that with the busy bone s long lasting promise i might be able to just give her one of these and at least have time to wash the dishes why do not i describe what happened next i was in the kitchen washing the dishes it had been about fifteen minutes since i would given the dog the bone deeply absorbed in annoyance with myself for not rinsing said dishes i was scrubbing vigorously when an awful sound met my ears a terrible and hauntingly familiar crunching noise the dog was eating my bed so i go into the bedroom to scold her and even before i get a chance to look at the bed frame i am struck by the mess she has caused the busy bone somehow leaves little brown crumbles all over the floor too small and numerous to pick up by hand and too gushy for the vacuum cleaner to clean up the oobleck has to be washed out of the carpet with a dish rag and did i mention that they are expensive i will continue to stick with real bones that i purchase from the butcher they are cheaper they last longer and they do not leave a terrible mess 
negative,17/4/21,my dog demolished her busy bone in under minutes i think she basically ate it which was a huge disappointment we were hoping for something that we could give her that she would enjoy but also something that would last a bit longer in addition to being more of a treat than a chew these things are messy she had it all over the floor around her and all over her paws it makes a sticky goop that is not very easy to clean up i definitely will not buy these again it is too expensive to only last minutes 
negative,21/1/21,i write this letter after considerable thought and anguish on friday morning february i was awakened by the screams of my fianc eacute e lori as she sat on the living room floor cradling greta our year old registered female pug greta crawled under the coffee table and there choked to death alone on a purina busy bone i am left wondering how purina a company with a name as iconic as betty crocker bayer gerber and general mills could have not only manufactured such a lethal product but as i have since discovered on the internet has had issues with it in the deaths of other dogs for some time and not pulled this dangerous item from the shelves i find this absolutely appalling i am years old and i have put my trust in purina products since i was a child and now our beloved greta purchased from a breeder as an adorable puppy in the fall of is dead because of your product and lori my sweetheart of years a stroke victim in and who most certainly can do without this kind of stressful catastrophe a great animal lover has had her heart torn asunder she is simply devastated and angry and so am i did you know that in the united states its citizens spend more on their pets than their children are you familiar with the westminster kennel club dog show series which includes the world s finest breeds in competition for best in show including the chinese pug do you have any idea of the loss we have suffered at your negligent hands i could talk about the money we paid for greta from the breeder and having her spayed we do not breed our beloved pets we keep them as loving companions for as long as we can and there are the regular check ups and shots and so on i find it bitterly ironic that the veterinary office we use is within walking distance of the kroger store from which we purchased your killing busy bone i have a year old father who lives alone i visit him at least twice a week sometimes more if time allows he certainly appreciates those visits but he also has a fulltime companion spencer his jack russell terrier spencer will turn in may dad is disabled uses a walker is scheduled for heart valve replacement surgery at the cleveland clinic and has a myriad of other health issues yet despite them he has managed to take very good care of his dog and i believe if it were not for the loving attention spencer gives dad he would not be alive today his dog has given him something special the gift of life something which purina has stolen away from us you would think that purina would have the same consideration for the welfare of dogs in this country as a disabled year old man but tragically that is not the case yet there is more we also have a male pug which we named winston because he has the same tenacious bulldog features etched into his amazing face as that of winston churchill winston like greta was is truly an individual a soulful companion and like us he is now subdued he is actually depressed because his playmate has disappeared and he does not understand why this concerns me i am a professional photographer and writer by trade i work with the general public and i have to present a side to it which instills confidence writing by nature requires a certain state of mind as well as a result of losing greta all i can think about now is me handing her a busy bone not knowing that it would snatch her away from us forever a short while later the guilt is killing me how can i write how can i do anything grief passes they say but tragic memories remain fixed for a lifetime and what makes things worse in this case is that greta s death could have been prevented though both winston and greta liked the busy bone several times in the past greta had gagged on it so i served her a smaller portion each time which after careful observation i assumed resolved the problem in retrospect i should have responded more to the concerns lori expressed over this potential danger to begin with in a brief moment while we were in another room greta died because of your product and why should such a product even exist why was not it at least labeled as a choking hazard why did not purina conduct the adequate safety research before releasing this product to the stores the answer is self evident gross negligence a negligence which has caused the death of not only our beloved greta and other dogs but has now indelibly left its mark in lori s and my life we will never be able to erase the painful images seared into our minds of her lying still on the floor i lie awake at night thinking about it now as well as remembering digging her grave in our backyard through such anguish that even i a writer cannot express in words it is now the closest we can get to our special friend we are utterly distraught greta only years old healthy and in her prime a wonderful loving companion is gone forever it is a horrid loss that cannot be replaced thanks to purina the very least purina can do is pull all forms of the busy bone from the market immediately and to conduct adequate responsible research in the future before releasing any purina product karl and lori former owners of beloved greta purebred female pug our baby gone forever 
negative,30/1/21,i had used this frequently on and off over the years and did not realize that it is not sold in the us any longer in the past the instructions were in english on the packet but i do not recall what they were now it is entirely in german and no one i know speaks a word of the language i do not have a scanner so one of the solutions suggested will not work do not buy before realizing that if you do not speak german and have no one to translate you are in a pickle i have packs now another thing all packs expire in months time so do not buy in bulk unless you plan to eat a lot of sauerbraten rated only because i am unable to use the product and the product description does not mention either the language issue or the near term expiration date 
negative,13/2/21,i would we willing to try this product and have six envelopes in my cupboard but unfortunately the instructions are in german maybe i can hire an interpreter 
negative,15/1/21,arm hammer s baking soda is aluminum free they just do not write it on their packaging i was not sure so i called them and they said there is no aluminum in it and they would have to state it if there was because people take the product internally this leads me to believe that there just is not aluminum in baking soda and researching it showed me that there might have been in the past but not anymore and not for a long time i resent that bob s red mill writes aluminum free on their package and then charges a premium for their product it is also arsenic free i hope if they label it arsenic free will we assume other brands are not i do not like that kind of marketing 
negative,6/3/21,all baking soda is aluminum free this is an unnecessary marketing ploy to get you to buy their product buy this because it is naturally mined and is cruelty free but do not be duped into thinking that good ole arm hammer has aluminum in it by the way the chemical process used to make a h is almost exactly what occurs in nature just faster but not cheaper it costs no more to mine sodium bicarbonate than it does to manufacture so yes you are paying for a name 
negative,8/6/21,i just called bob s red mill customer service just do a g search for the company their customer service number is under contact us on their site and i was annoyed to learn that none of bob s red mill baking soda contains aluminum i have been paying with shipping for this magical aluminum free baking soda only to learn that the bob s red mill premium baking soda at my local grocery is the same exact thing call for yourself if you do not believe me ugh 
negative,7/1/21,i was very unhappy when this package arrived at my workplace the bags were not wrapped for shiping and was damage in route when i opened the box the baking soda was spiling all over the place i could not identify where the many holes were and did not have acess to a container to put them in so i threw it away i made a mess all over the place what a waste i will not be ordering from this company again 
negative,17/4/21,what constitutes a good coffee is rather subjective you can read countless reviews about it but you do not know until you have tried it for yourself having enjoyed peaberry coffee i think the spherical shape results in better roasting from many different parts of the world i gave this a shot based on the positive reviews posted and the great price boy was i disappointed the beans are light medium in roast has a mild subdued smell the beans looked dry but this is not uncommon for light roasts i made a fine grind of the beans and brewed it in a press sad to say it was the most disappointing cup of coffee i have had in a long time the flavor was stale without any fruity characteristic of peaberries and reminded me of a cheap cup of joe from a dirty diner the worst part is i am stuck with lbs of terrible coffee that cannot be returned amazon does not accept return of food items 
negative,10/3/21,my reason for the low rating is that there was no use by date on the bag making it difficult to know if the beans were old and not well cared for or if that is just the way tanzanian peaberry beans roast up not sure how a manufacturer gets away without putting a date on their products but this supplier has found some way to get around it the coffee does taste good although a hint of staleness exists but the beans are totally dry no oil no moisture is present when they are ground i have enjoyed peaberry coffees from hawaii for years peaberries are the best of the best beans i have also come to enjoy african coffees for their full yet mild taste so to find peaberry coffee from tanzania at such a great price was too much to pass up i expect to finish up the coffee i have purchased but probably would not buy it again or buy any coffee from this supplier since i have no assurance of its freshness 
negative,14/1/21,i rarely post a product review but i feel that i would be irresponsible as a consumer if i did not comment on the tanzania peaberry whole coffee beans i had high hopes when purchasing this coffee and i did my best to tolerate them to illustrate i have consumed almost one whole bag of the three but will have to dump the other two in the trash the beans are stale dry over roasted with little flavor even loading up the coffee with sugar does not seem to help i resolved that this morning would be my last cup i will have to resort to buying the eight of the clock brand at my local grocery store i even briefly considered giving the two unopened bags to a friend but decided that it was not worth alienating him coffee bean direct you need to do better much better 
negative,24/5/21,regular reduced fat milk from horizon received slightly over a month away from the expiration date my intention was to buy whole milk but the product description is confusing i sent an email to the customer support no response after weeks i checked and found that they made the picture larger good but left the product description without change as for me it is crazy expensive shipping while i can get same fat free or reduced fat milk at stopnshop or market basket the difficult thing is to find whole milk funny that whole milk as natural product became unpopular i guess too many people are concerned about becoming overweight 
negative,14/10/21,once again i find myself trying to like tazo herbal teas but they keep putting licorice in teas where is just does not seem to belong to me anyway this is another example where i expected a lovely flavored tea and the licorice flavor is so strong it is just about all i can taste i guess i will just give up on tazo who ever blends all their teas has radically different taste buds than mine 
negative,7/2/21,this tea was not what i expected i love cinnamon tea and was very disappointed with this product the tea does not have a strong cinnamon flavor which i enjoy this tea has a stronger rooibos flavor than cinnamon flavor furthermore i found that the product description does not give a full list of the tea s ingredients the ingredients listed on the box include cinnamon licorice root orange peel indian sarsaparilla chicory root rooibos natural flavors star anise almond extract and locorice extract
negative,29/3/21,wow very weird taste i typically like all the ingredients but this mix just tastes wrong it is somewhat similar to sarsaparilla tea but with a licorice aftertaste it is not so bad that i could not finish the first cup but not my cup of tea 
negative,17/4/21,well i bought this item before and enjoyed it immensely pink salmon is very good for you this time i ordered again received albacore tuna instead of pink salmon amazon does not do returns on groceries such as these even if not opened that i can see i sent personally an email to raincoast trading company based in canada also left a phone message as well delayed response but finally got emails and they were courteous but they redirected me to try help center to get credit and get the correct item gone through hoops in the help center of amazon to no avail until i found the toll free amazon phone number amazon llc confirmed they can not accept the return but will send the correct item promptly we shall see awaiting a replacement item a minor complaint they are smaller can sizes than the normal pink salmon i am used to ordering anyone want some tuna o well p s updated review sept i finally got the ordered item partly because the amazon rep corrected it when i called in and sent it fast by the way it cost me a toll call to canada to the company without a prompt reply that just added insult to injury well i was able to order from a different merchant through amazon thank you amazon for coming through 
negative,10/3/21,i purchased this product to lure black bear to the bait pile the product has no sweet smell as one would expect i have asked for a refund or exchange from the supplier no response 
negative,10/7/21,i got sent the wrong item which happens i know i tried to contact the company multiple times with no response i finally had to contact amazon and they are returning the item for me 
negative,27/1/21,my cat has an iron stomach she can eat absolutely anything and everything and is always getting into my human food and has never thrown up i gave her of these treats and within minutes she was wheezing and throwing up all over my carpet i did not connect it at first but when i gave her the same treats the next day exact same reaction i have tried several different flavors of this same brand and she has had the same reaction if you are trying these with your cat for the time only give them of them and just wait to see how they react before you give them anymore 
negative,1/6/21,both of my cats age threw up for an extended period after eating just of these into the trash they go not the cats the treats not sure what they were reacting to but thought it would be good to let other cat parents know the risk 
negative,20/8/21,my sweet little persian looks like she is dying she is been puking all night because of these treats how has this item not been recalled 
negative,14/8/21,i have two cats my big boy has eaten these and never had a problem as a matter of fact he has never vomited or had a hair ball since i adopted him at months my girl cat throws up every time she eats this particular flavor since i treat them equally these are no longer purchased i hate to see my girl sick so i just recommend you watch your cats after you give them these treats if not a problem carry on 
negative,21/4/21,i have tried it with both my cats several times every time they eat this and other whiskas temptations products they vomit within minutes they love it they want it it is cheap but it makes them puke so i would consider this a bad purchase 
negative,1/4/21,i do not want anyone to think this is an unfair review of the product it is more of a warning from my own personal experience so others do not make a mistake when i got my new kitten from the humane society they sent him home with a goodie bag that happened to include these treats i started feeding them to him and he seemed to like it then i noticed he would vomit occasionally it was only after closer inspection did i realize these treats are for cats months and older i am sure there is a reason for this they caused his vomiting i switched to a different temptations medley and he has not vomited since so keep in mind there is a reason they limit these to older cats they really are not kitten safe i only wish my humane society realized this before sending them home with him i can only imagine they feed these to all the cats in their care without reading the package 
negative,17/4/21,i finally did the research on this temptation treats and i am glad to see that my suspicions are correct i have been buying this treats for my kitty for years and suspected them all along to be the because of him vomiting ironically i even bought the hairball ones to see if they would make him stop vomiting now is official i stopped giving them to him as often and then monitored him whenever i gave him any it soon became clear to me that he only vomits whenever i give him this treats sometimes he would vomit within minutes and other times he would vomit during the night or the next morning but if i give him this treats i am sure to be cleaning up orangee throw up off my carpet soon after i think is a matter of allergy or sensitivity to one of the ingredients and they probably do not do anything to other cats but i am never buying this again for my kitty 
negative,10/3/21,you know i was searching the internet for the words temptations and vomit when i came across these reviews i was surprised to hear that i am not the only one who has had problems with this product within an hour of eating these treats my cat vomits for about minutes i did not realize it was the because until the second time i fed them to her it is really bad because it does not because the cat to throw up all at once it is like she can just vomit a little at a time and you are forced to follow her around cleaning up all the vomit or locking her in the bathroom which is horrible 
negative,22/4/21,i have fed my cats these treats the last days within minutes of eating them they are both throwing up i will be going back to the three dog bakery treats expensive but have never made my cats sick why is the company not responding to so many bad reviews 
negative,25/4/21,i have never written an amazon review before but this product was so horrible i had to warn would be buyers i can eat pretty much anything but i had to empty out both bottles it just tasted like colored sugar water very thin sickening sweet do not know if there was any onion flavoring the only reason i bought this is because i could not get ken s steakhouse vidalia onion dressing shipped in california so far the worst product i have purchased on amazon buyer beware unless you like sugar water then drink up blech 
negative,1/4/21,does anyone realize tocopherol usually comes from soy i am still hunting for a cracker i do not have to make their website is unclear about it is source 
negative,30/6/21,used for less then months both cats fur began falling out bad stopped using it the cats fur is back to fine back to feeding my cats nature s variety instinct i baught this petgaurd product at fairway market not amazon will not use it again 
negative,1/3/21,i felt really good about being a good cat mommy and buying something of such quality for my sweeties too bad none of the would eat it no matter what i did donated it to the local spca maybe a dog will eat it 
negative,29/1/21,this coffee brews very weak like a light roast w p chef s reserve pods are just over half full put pod on scale and it is less coffee wgt than normal pods stick with normal pods or extra bold if you like coffee that taste like coffee 
negative,17/4/21,i wanted to like this coffee i did we have tried other wolfgang puck k cups and have been pleasantly surprised this just did not impress us bitter aftertaste and it has an almost sickeningly vanilla flavor smells great while brewing but just does not live up to it in the cup i am really disappointed because i now have a box and a half of this product that we really do not want to drink great price though 
negative,10/3/21,warning this is a strong flavor i thought that this would be blue mountain y oh no it is like rum flavored or something yuk 
negative,30/5/21,nowhere in the description does it mention anything about this coffee being flavored i am still not sure what flavor it is some type of nut i wrongly assumed that jamaican coffee would be similar to the blue mountain coffee which jamaica is known for how silly of me to assume that i hate flavored coffees so i was so disappointed to now own boxes of such a horrible coffee it only says flavored very small on the box so i did not notice it before i opened it hopefully i can pawn it off to visitors and buy some regular bold coffee flavored coffee for myself 
negative,28/9/21,no where in the description does it mention that this is a flavored coffee by the name i thought it was a jamaican blue mountain blend but its flavored with a weak tasting hazelnut not very good
negative,6/5/21,i was in a hurry and did not read the reviews i trusted amazon s description and it did not indicate it was flavored coffee and that it was not jamaican it is very lightly flavored with vanilla so it is not too bad i feel cheated 
negative,20/4/21,i thought this was a jamaican blend or roast but turns out it is simply a heavily flavored coffee the flavor tastes artificial like fake maple syrup flavoring we have three coffee drinkers in our house and none of us could get past the first few sips now i have to find a home for the rest of it so it does not go to waste 
negative,20/4/21,i wish amazon would require any coffee with sweet artificial flavorings to be plainly identified as such then folks who really dislike coffee adulterated this way could avoid getting another disappointing flavored cup of coffee this stuff tastes the way i imagine newman s own extra bold coffee would taste with curdled spoiled bailey s irish cream dumped in it nasty shudder 
negative,21/4/21,i drink about to cups of coffee every morning i am always looking for a new flavor so i gave it a try i drank it but i would not order again steve
negative,2/5/21,first of all i have owned a keurig for about years now and i have tried lot s of coffee during that time i have had an occasion k cup that did not function correctly and loaded the brew with grounds i probably should have returned these before i bothered to open the second box since i drink my coffee from a thermal cup i can tell you that taking that last drink to find your mouth full of coffee grounds stinks i have had to throw out at least cups of coffee its a bit like russian roulette and i have started straining it after i brew it i know that its not my brewer because it is not happening with the green mountain timothy s or tully s that i also use the good cups are a bit weak for my taste but the flavor is ok definitely prefer not to waste s on a product with a manufacturing defect 
negative,25/5/21,this was the nastiest flavored coffee i have ever had in kcups i purchase many different kinds of flavored coffee and caramel is my favorite but this one made me gag it smelled like buttery cheese and the taste was not what i expected i will stick to gloria jeans and timothys flavored coffees this was my first wolfgang puck kcup and will be the last i order of his brand i thought maybe i got a bad cup but i brewed and i opened the other box and tried those since it comes with two boxes and same nastiness 
negative,7/9/21,i am not a fan of flavored coffee and i thought i had read the description of this product very carefully but nowhere did i see any indication that it was a flavored coffee i wish the descriptions of the coffees offered by amazon were clearer so that there is no confustion as to what you are purchasing even the name of the product is a little deceptive since one might assume that it is jamaican coffee 
negative,25/5/21,i use to purchase jamaica beans locally and it was great this jamaica me crazy is nothing close to it the odor is terrible and it tastes like the coffee is flat or stale other people in household tried it and could not get past the first cup pitched the remainder cups in the trash 
negative,22/5/21,this coffee tastes very flavorful and is not too strong but i have to say it almost ruined my months old keurig personal brewer the coffee is ground so finely that when the k cups are punctured by the needles top and bottom it gets packed into the needles and also sifts out through the holes made by the needles going into the coffee cup creating a very nasty sludge in the bottom of each cup i purchased a pack of k cups and did not even use one full pack i do not recommend this brand or blend it is a waste of money which is something i could not really afford at this time i sent a letter of complaint to the wolfgang puck company and except for a cookie cutter letter acknowledging receipt of my comment i have not received any further contact from them 
negative,19/7/21,unfortunately i am much too frugal to throw away something i have spent perfectly good money on so i am continuing to use these suckers until they are gone hopefully in a few weeks i thought i was buying a decent brand of coffee given the wolfgang puck name but alas i was wrong using the middle cup size on my keurig coffeemaker these k cups make a weak cup of coffee more like brown water no taste no nothing i switched to the smallest size cup and it is marginally better but still barely drinkable i would not serve these to guests ever i cannot wait to be done with these boxes of junk so i can order something with some taste please do not waste your money 
negative,7/9/21,the aroma is pleasant and flavor is nice and smooth but it is very very weak i really wanted to like this one as there are very few available on subscribe and save but i just cannot recommend it even making smaller cups it is very weak i am going to stick to newman s own organics extra bold as my go to k cup for now 
negative,25/8/21,i admit i am not terribly fond of flavored coffees but this one is not for us we both love the rodeo drive i have a good freind that loves this coffee i sent her ours 
negative,6/9/21,i am definitely not a coffee connoisseur but this stuff is bad it is a disappointment because i expected a wolfgang puck product to have more class this tastes artificial and it cannot stand alone without tons of cream and sweetener will not buy again 
negative,25/5/21,the coffee tasted bitter and like it was burnt i cleaned the machine and it still tasted bitter and burnt will not order this again 
negative,7/9/21,i am amazed that people are happy with this product i am not a drinker of the dark brews french roast or anything but even for a drinker of a milder cup of coffee this is completely tasteless the initial scent is delicious too bad none of it shows up in the actual coffee 
negative,13/10/21,to me this coffee was extremely bitter i dumped it out and made a different cup it made me afraid to try other wp coffees but i did like the wp sumatra kopi raya for reference purposes my in store drink is a starbucks americano my favorite k cups are starbucks french roast starbucks caffe verona starbucks pike place roast green mountain xtra bold sumatran reserve green mountain double black diamond green mountain revv green mountain dark magic other k cups i have tried coffee people jet fuel green mountain dark magic decaf emeril jazzed up decaf starbucks caffe verona coffee people black tiger starbucks house blend starbucks breakfast blend starbucks sumatra wolfgang puck french roast green mountain lake and lodge green mountain french roast caribou mahogony wolfgang puck sumatra kopi raya emeril big easy bold
negative,2/10/21,this wolfgang puck coffee jamaica me crazy is the worst coffee i have ever had i threw it out right away after one sip it taste like all coconut flavoring hard to believe someone thought this taste good and was marketable they should be fired 
negative,23/9/21,ugh no where on the amazon page for this item did it state that it was hazelnut flavored i have been choking this down for a month just trying to get through it thought it was going to be a blue mountain like jamaican coffee 
negative,26/6/21,this coffee is only mediocre in quality i do not like a highly acidic coffee nor do i like it when the coffee outdates within weeks of the order date the only reason i am not more dissatified with this lousy coffee is that i paid very little for it by using a credit i had at amazon payments i do not recommend this coffee 
negative,25/5/21,if keurig brewers were evaluated by this particular k cup keurig would be out of business wolfgang puck french roast melange francais is inexcusably terrible coffee aroma hints of singed oak leave and the top note is simply bitter mid taste is like the bottom ounces of a days old kwiki mart carafe mouth feel is harsh and leaves an appalling coating the after taste leads one to immediately brush ones teeth i simply could not believe my keurig was capable of making such a bad cup of coffee so i tried again a week later with same results i use average to good filtered water and have no problems with other brands like green mountain tulleys nor emeril s everyone i know that has a keurig learned of it via word of mouth or a shared cup usually the results are stunning and the keurig invasion lives on when i share i will stick with offering the coffee peoples black tiger or jet fuel now i have more wp fr k cups sitting in the bottom draw of my china cabinet to get rid of let me know if you want them as i would be embarrassed to even give them away sorry wolfgang but what the puck your french roast is unpardonably horrible and at k cup prices i will not be duped again i will stay away from any of the other wp offerings 
negative,7/9/21,this stuff tasted like pipe tobacco smells my son did not like it either and i ended up throwing it out 
negative,15/7/21,no thanks kind of bitter and has slight overtone of cardboard organic bold and donut shop are still our faves 
negative,3/6/21,wolfgang puck s breakfast in bed is a much more flavorful and robust medium roast than this one 
negative,27/9/21,this is not regular coffee as the description would lead you to believe it is artificially flavored and it appears from the other ratings that you either love the flavor or hate it my household hated it of course that would be my problem if the description was accurate but it is not amazon refunded my money and said someone would check the information on the product page 
negative,19/6/21,as coffee these kcups are just ok as flavored coffee these are disappointing i found the vanilla to be barely detectable 
negative,25/5/21,are these people crazy or can i not multiple properly this is for small cups of peaches that works out to for the pack this pack cost about in a grocery store in the states but because i am deployed i am suppose to pay for it not happening netgrocer com is higher than a grocercy store but cheaper than this 
negative,7/9/21,product has a shelf life of two years and was labeled as produced in december of product leaked from seal in carton 
negative,3/8/21,i am not happy about writing this review i had very high expectations from both the name and the high praise given by the other reviewers i was at once concerned however based on the weak aroma at first opening and these initial concerns were confirmed at first use little flavor here i have found a home recipe based off of the ingredient list with stuff from my spice rack produces a much better result beef rub brown sugar sea salt paprika chille rosemary fresh garlic chipotle powder cumin and mccormick montreal steak seasoning chicken rub brown sugar paprika sea salt chille mccormick montreal chicken seasoning curry garlic cinnamon and chinese five spices 
negative,5/9/21,medaglia d oro has to be the worst coffee i have ever had it had an old musty flavor and odor you get what pay for

negative,7/9/21,these jelly beans were very unusual when they showed up they came in a package without a jelly belly logo the jelly beans themselves had no jelly belly logo and i do not really know if they were actually jelly bellys i got them as a gift so i did not try any of them but it was odd giving a gift where it did not seem like they were anything special like i would bagged up some licorice jelly beans from the grocery store or something big woop so i was disappointed and because they were a gift i had no idea what they tasted like so were they really jelly bellys who knows i felt silly giving them though 
negative,11/9/21,i would not buy this particular yogi tea again because i hate the taste of licorice anise the flavor of the licorice and fennel seed is very dominant making it a sort of sickly sweet flavor which was not what i was hoping for with my burning throat i think a better blend would be something with more heat like ginger which is why i usually drink yogi s cold season instead for the same purpose with a sore throat its reasonable to suffer through a yucky flavor if it makes a discernible difference but this tea did not do that 
negative,13/7/21,i ordered this for my birthday i got birthday money from family and i ordered a couple of goodies perfume and this cocoa i love hot chocolate and i am always looking for new ones to try based on the first review i decided to go ahead and order i will probably not reorder mixed by itself into hot water it seems to lack thickness it also has too much of an artificial raspberry taste i like hershey s bliss raspberry chocolate much better i have been adding one spoonful of the cobblestone kitchen to my regular cocoa to give it a raspberry boost but by itself it does not stand up to the test i plan on finishing the three remaining cans over time by using it as a stir in additive to other cocoa 
negative,22/7/21,my first time having curry rice but boy i cooked this stuff exactly how you are supposed to taste was not bad i guess a little strong though it was thick like ice slush it was over bearing and the spice was pretty intense i do not think i will get it again i guess it is good stuff seen it in some curry making videos used often but not for me as it it is way to thick i had potatoes onions and pork prepared to perfection mixed with it and i could not taste them at all i could not taste the pork or anything only the sauce

negative,28/7/21,good idea but the company should use a better soil compound maybe darker it is hard to tell if the soil is wet or dry present compound blows away when i water it finally sprouted and i will transpant to a regular top soil when it grows more at least with soil you can tell when it is dry right now i will give it small amounts of water weekly until that happens very disappointed with this product 
negative,13/10/21,i bought two bags of these thinking it was the same product that i used to buy in different packaging light blue with a see through dog shape against a grass green background unfortunately it was completely not the same thing these treats were actually like jerky tough and brittle i give my dog soft treats because he does not chew the damn things and he choked on these horrible things i had to toss them out note that the zuke s jerky naturals with the other packaging http www amazon com zukes jerky naturals beef dp have always been moist and soft and i have never had a problem with those i suspect that this batch was not new packaging as i had thought but very old packaging these may be the same treats i usually feed my dog just having sat on a shelf for years in any case these were completely different treats and not safe to feed my dog

negative,19/2/21,my wife really loves o n e coconut water i thought via auto ship would be a great way not to have to go to the store every other day to get some i ordered cases of ea the first problem occurred when case number one was sent back as undeliverable i guess a san diego address would be undeliverable in kentucky of the remaining cases all of which did arrive but in not great condition all the cases were still sealed but had of the ounce boxes split open and there were other boxes in other cases that were stale really had a rancid smell therefore i cancelled the auto ship and have gone back to picking this up in the local supermarket works out better just more time consuming and heavier it would have been nice knowing that the cases were in fact pretty flimsy my wife still loves the product 
negative,14/12/20,first off i did not purchase this product through amazon but at a local grocery store so my review only reflects the product itself not amazon in any way i bought this last week never having tried coconut water before but i heard good things the taste of it was almost like the smell of lawn clippings that had been damp and out in the sun for a long time tasted off and had a faint mold smell to it i did not know if it was supposed to taste like that or not as i never tried it before but paying as much as i did i felt obligated to finish it off i have been ill for about a week after drinking it i do not know if it was just a coincidence or the because of it i did email customer service at o n e the day i drank it asking if it was supposed to taste like that or if i got a bad batch and they still have not replied to me 
negative,1/6/21,people watch out if you are buying this product online i have ordered bottles of the o n e i was expecting this to be same as what i bought from store but this seller disappointed me the bottles have the seal broken and the taste of the coconut water is not what i expected i am sure that this seller the person who packaged the bottles added water by breaking the seal i have wasted my money on this product i will never buy this online for a few bucks cheap rather than go to the nearby store and buy it my rating for this product is in short seal broken diluted and not comparable with the one that i bought from store 
negative,1/4/21,hi i am very disappointed with the past shipment i received of the one coconut water of the boxes were leaking and the coconut water was spoiled thanks laks
negative,15/4/21, so you know i am serious i would give it a were it an option i love amazon they have never let me down so i am hoping they come through for me when i file a claim with them the product was rock hard so i followed the enclosed instructions and heated it even less than the recommended time in the microwave it kneaded easily enough and smelled tasted good when it came to rolling i could tell immediately that this was going to be a challenge sure enough it tore all over the place redo i used cornstarch the way i was taught and it still stuck to every surface as if it were too warm or wet yet cracked as if it were too dry nothing made it cooperate so i lowered my standards and draped it anyway durring the two foot trip from the rolling surface to the cake it ripped in several places and the application to the cake ended in absolute disaster no i did not roll it too thin yes i used cornstarch even though the packaging specifically claims it is unnecessary it sucks the end 
negative,19/5/21,this product was so easy to work with on i made a little over flowers for wedding cupcakes the following day i did the same using a different color of satin ice the flowers of both fondants were firm i stored them in an air tight container on i opened the container of flower made with the fondarific and they were soft the flowers made from satin ice were perfect i left the container of fondarific flowers open over night to see if they would harden up again they turned out gummy you know like chewed gum which is probably less sticky than this mess i am so dissappointed in this product fortunately i made my flowers early i have time to purchase satin ice and make more flowers i do not recommend this product

negative,15/10/21,i guess everyone is taste buds are different this product did not work for me every food item tasted as it should 
negative,20/7/21,dissolved an entire tab on my tongue and was disappointed to discover that it had no effect on any of the foods that i tried 
negative,12/10/21,i bought my mberry pack from mberry us online hoping to use it to curb my sweet tooth i followed the directions to the letter allowing the tablet to dissolve completely on my tongue i then tried balsalmic vinegar nothing happened to the taste at all except that my tongue burned a little so i tried hot sauce nothing happened again except that my tongue burned a lot then i tried regular vinegar nothing happened again i even tried taking a second tablet but it still did nothing but slightly burn my tongue huge waste of money super disappointing does not work 
negative,19/2/21,not much to say other than the product solicitation is all hype i carefully followed the directions on the packaging of the mberry miracle fruit tablets and the results were about as miraculous as one of those potato chips baring the face of mary magdelene sorry believers of miracles this is one that will not make the tonight show 
negative,14/12/20,i was excited about these and had organized a whole event for my fiancee s birthday around these tablets placed an order well in advance namely weeks in advance after two weeks of waiting i received a notification that my order was being cancelled for some mysterious as yet to be determined problem the email attempted to spread the blame between amazon its supplier and some mysterious unknown factor ultimately taking no real responsibility for the blunder color me frustrated and confused because while they said they are stopping all orders for the time being their company website still shows the product in stock and ready for orders this to say the least was very disappointing and more so because the company s response was very wishy washy and lame in my experience when a company screws up mind you it was not just my order it was a whole slew of orders that got cancelled they should own up and take responsibility thereby showing some integrity rather than mutter some indecipherable mumbo jumbo that does nothing to explain nor solve the customers problem 
negative,2/7/21,i am jealous of whoever thought of this but the actual product turns out to be pretty unimpressive it turns out if you eat half a fruit roll up then eat asparagus the aspragus tastes differently than you might expect there that is all you need to know do not buy this product just buy some gushers next time you are at wal mart star review because i like gushers 
negative,11/3/21,i dissolved an entire tab in my mouth and then ate bitter greens and it did nothing i added some vinegar to the greens and it did make it a tad sweeter but it did not make them taste good it makes really sour things slightly sweeter but no miracle 
negative,10/4/21,maybe the miracle fruit does not work for everyone it had very little effect when i used it i started with a clear pallet let the pill dissolve on my tongue etc then i tried the classic first a lime i noticed barely that it was not quite as pucker inducing as it may have been without the mberry but just slightly and it did not add any sweet it just inhibited a hint of sour other foods like vinegar vinegar chips guinness strawberries cheese etc many recommended fruits and foods have very little impact and after just a few minutes i could notice any change so either some people just do not have the same level of effect or much of the miracle berry effects are group dynamics and heightened suggestibility either way they were a let down 
negative,22/7/19,this was the first time i tried purchasing a food product over the internet and as feared i was sent something other than what was pictured this package contains chia seed powder which i assume is ground up seed or the remainder from packaging whole seeds that you have no way of identifying whether or not has additional filler not going to bother returning a product but just disappointed when the page advertises whole seeds 
negative,2/2/20,i was surprised by the number of star reviews of this product its a tiny gritty seed that gets stuck in every corner of your mouth and the taste is like nothing kind of like poppy seeds but with out the taste i finally ask myself why am i eating this annoying seed and put it out back in the bird feeder unfortunately they do not seem to like it much either 
negative,2/2/20,you think you are doing something good for your kid when you invest a little more to get an organic formula sadly that is not the case here this is a horrifically constipating formula lots of pain and straining guaranteed having to take measures to prevent this offering juices water etc is just not a sensible approach also the manufacturers use sucrose instead of lactose to save money and they use a lot of it with the same sweetness as country time lemonade similac organic s sucrose based formula may also set your child up for future diabetes check the ny times article for more info on this bottom line painful constipation in the near term possible diabetes and certainly a sweet tooth in the future no thanks 
negative,31/8/19, out of stars read this article first august by pregbaby florida see all my reviews i thought i was doing the right thing by buying organic and thought similac was a brand i could trust to be good for baby that is until i came across this ny times article about the sugar they use from the article parents may be buying similac organic because they believe that organic is healthier but babies may have a reason of their own for preferring similac organic it is significantly sweeter than other formulas it is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar or sucrose which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas no health problems in babies have been associated with similac organic but to pediatricians there are risks in giving babies cane sugar sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars once babies get used to its sweeter taste they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods and some studies suggest that they might overeat leading to rapid weight gain in the first year which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity 
negative,22/7/19,we switched from the advance similac to the organic product thinking it would be better as we prefer organic foods ourselves it was a disaster with our month old baby getting constipated and progressively worsening her intake till she fell drastically below her calorie intake we discontinued the product within five days and switched back to the previous similac and she is fine now her feeding and calorie intake is back to normal

negative,19/2/20,i ordered this on and it did not ship out until three and a half weeks later it is and i still have not received it yet next time i plan to order from a merchant who can fulfill it in a reasonable timeframe as far as the product is concerned i do like that the similac liquid formula in the size does not contain bpa i was really upset when i researched and discovered that the single use ready made liquid containers and large powdered containers both contain bpa i would expect more diligence from similac to be bpa free in all of their packaging 
negative,27/11/19,my child was exclusively breastfed for months and i gradually introduced similac organic formula to supplement my breastmilk started to dry up she found this was so much easier to eat she gave up on me by months by the time i completely stopped nursing she was so constipated from the formula that i switched she winced and cried and worked so long to just produced a hard ball the size of ping pong ball it was horrible i realized i was the one helping her poo with nursing and then she lost all ability when she went full formula i say switch 
negative,12/12/19,we breastfeed our month old boy but since his bilirubin level was still high doctors recommended to switch to formula for hours we started with similac advance shield plus which we still had from hospital first hours were wonderful in terms of pooping then we decided to switch to similac organic for known reasons but during the first ounce bottle i began to notice that his stool was getting harder and eventually he stopped pooing actually he produced two stone ball like poops and had a hard time for another hours breast milk and similac advance tested similarly sweet but similac organic was much much less sweet i made a research on the internet and i found the following that may help you to understand the because of constipation http www drhull com encymaster c constipation infant html constipation means infrequent hard stools it does not mean grunting or straining although your baby may certainly exhibit these behaviors when having a bowel movement so the first question to ask is is my child really constipated next consider why true constipation excessively hard dry stools arises the normal function of the colon is to remove water from the stool otherwise we would rapidly dehydrate and die that is why severe diarrhea is dangerous the stool is moving through the colon and being expelled from the body so fast there is no time to properly reabsorb the stool water back into the bloodstream conversely if the fecal material remains in the colon too long the water removal process may extract too much of the fecal water and leave the stool mass excessively dry and hard it is just that simple so constipation arises when feces remain in the colon too long because the colon is naturally sluggish has decreased motility we say a low residue diet produces insufficient stimulation to the colon to trigger its normal propulsive activity and clear out the feces a combination of the above two factors there is obstruction of the lower gi tract o functional neurologic the lower rectum and anus cannot properly relax to allow evacuation hirschprung disease o functional anatomic anal rectal positioning does not allow easy evacuation o mechanical a tumor physically blocks stool passage breast fed babies are essentially never truly constipated this is because breast milk is such a low residue diet almost all of the milk is absorbed by the baby and used the stools consist of a small amount of unabsorbed protein curds and a large amount of bowel secretions chiefly mucus and of course a lot of noisy gas but these infrequent stools do not indicate constipation just infrequent stools later when breast feeding infants start solids they technically can become constipated but it is unusual in my experience it is not until the child is pretty much on solids and especially when weaned to whole cow milk that constipation is much of an issue by then we are really discussing toddlers breast fed infants do tend to save up after the first few months and poop less often this worries some parents despite reassurances to the contrary some folks just have to see a poop every day from their little darling to be happy and fulfilled go figure they forget that stool can stay in the colon for a very very long time and it will not hurt anything when the stool hoarding breast feeder does finally get ready to go another problem comes to the fore grunting and straining when the baby s rectum forms in utero it is in a state of permanent contraction for nigh onto nine months the baby does not pass the meconium fetal stool in utero until perhaps right at the end of gestation right before during or after delivery until the baby is several months old and has passed and been stretched by quite a few bowel movements the rectum and particularly the anus may be quite tight and resist easy dilation to allow the stool to pass because the baby has weak flabby abdominal musculature that is why his little tummy is so poochy he must push against this tight anal spincter with his diaphragm just as mom pushed during delivery and with seemingly equal discomfort hence the grunting and red faced straining the other major problem of both breast or bottle fed newborns which creates this sort of straining is dyschezia or uncoordinated stooling the cure for the problem of a tight anus is pretty simple a gentle rectal exam with a well lubricated pinky finger by the doctor which should be done on all babies with stooling troubles anyway to rule out a physical obstruction will be both diagnostic and curative if one such gentle dilation does not do the trick i have mom bring the baby back in a week and repeat the procedure the anal spincter is stretched and pretty soon no more terrible straining top bottle fed infants are a whole nother story infant formulas are not nearly as well digested as breast milk and leave quite a bit more residue in the colon the exception to this rule in my mind is the new similac that really does seem to leave the stools about the same consistency as breast milk so true constipation in bottle fed infants is much more common my feeling is that soy formulas are even worse than cow milk based formulas in this regard the young infant s colon is simply not designed for all the residue and stool bulk the residue builds up is dried too much and becomes hard pebbly stool it is naturally difficult and uncomfortable for the baby to pass the addition of cereal to the diet only compounds whatever problems already exist cereal milk concrete cereal in the formula bottle seems to be especially bad probably because parents do not realise just how much cereal the baby is getting top treatment of constipation mainly involves common sense diet modifications and sometimes medication again as with breast fed babies a search for the because of the constipation and gentle rectal exam can work wonders i use a lot of karo corn syrup for bottle feeders with constipation it is my first choice recomendation it almost always works if used properly unfortunately many doctors and nurses do not use it properly get poor results and do not recommend it as often as they should i start with two measuring teaspoons in every formula bottle regardless of size and adjust the dose up or down depending on how things are going usually the baby can be weaned off the karo pretty soon but may need to stay on it periodically for the first few months of life it is very important to put the corn syrup in the formula and not give it in between in water the excess corn syrup does not get digested very well the baby is already digesting all the sugar he can from the formula the excess sugar passes down to the colon and produces a sugar diarrhea similar to sorbitol as below prunes apple juice before scolding me about the risk of botulism from corn syrup please see clinical pediatric emergency medicine volume number september pediatric neurologic potpourri cases to remember in the past c botulinum was also found in corn syrup but this is no longer a risk factor for infant botulism because of a recent change in the processing formula for the complete source of statement see olsen sj swerdlow dl risk of infant botulism from corn syrup in reply pediatr infect dis j certain fruits and juices for example prunes apple juice apricots are rich in sorbitol a nondigestible sugar that passes through the body to the colon and causes water to be retained or drawn into the stool mass they can be increased in the diet to loosen the stool and relieve or prevent constipation lactulose is a non absorbable sugar product that is processed by colon bacteria to produce an inflow of water into the stool mass we use it a lot it seems to be a favorite of our local pediatric gastroenterologists the dose is adjusted up or down according to respose side effects are usually not serious but can include cramping or diarrhea obviously stop the medicine and call your doctor if these occur glycerine suppositories are helpful to relieve your child if there is some hard stool that just will not come out easily the suppository melts in the heat of the rectum and lubricates the stool glycerine also has a mild effect of attracting water into the stool which softens it the act of insertion also serves to stimulate the rectum and anus to initiate the defecation reflex glycerine is completely safe it is a food found in candy not a drug fiber containing foods are helpful for older children and adults but are not really of much use in the treatment of young infant constipation for dietary reasons babies just do not eat a lot of fiber i believe isoyalac which was a high fiber soy formula has been discontinued it was never very available any place i practiced anyway top myths and misconceptions concerning infant constipation iron in the formula causes constipation no way i can understand lay people thinking this to be the case because when adults take iron preparations in large doses they may become constipated but the tiny amount present in infant formula is not nearly enough to because any problems the irritating thing to me is to hear doctors and nurses who should know better repeating this nonsense and switching the infants to the less healthy low or no iron formulas increasing water in the diet is commonly recommended it makes very little sense and demonstrates a failure to reflect on the basic physiologic because of the overdry stool the problem is too little water retention in the stool not too little water in the body unless there is increased fiber or some chemical substance such as a sugar karo lactulose to retain the water in the stool excess water will simply wind up in the diaper as urine top
negative,26/9/20,do not buy this product you will not be doing your infant any favors if at all possible you should be breastfeeding i know it is not always easy or convenient if you cannot then in my opinion the best formula is earth s best and even that is disappointing basically they dry cow s milk and remove all the natural nutrients then fortify with synthetic vitamins minerals pathetic just buy whole organic milk raw if possible there are recipes online to make it closer to human breast milk sorry to be so matter of fact i am losing patience for all these evil corporations capitalizing on the green movement oh and by the way the second ingredient in this garbage is sugar good way to start the diabetes obesity while they are young

negative,30/1/21,i was very disappointed with the quality of the coffee i have purchased blue mountain coffee before from other places and it was always great but this was totally unsatisfactory it had a mildewed flavor to it like it had been stored for a long time in a warehouse that was damp or moldy for the money i paid for it i was quite displeased and will never buy from them again 
negative,2/11/20,my son had this jablum roasted and ground coffee brought back from jamaica and paid a lot for it i have drunk blue mountain for years when i can but this was shocking it tasted stale when you opened the bag and even worse when you drank it it was definitely off he bought bags and every one we tried was the same i would never buy another we had bought another brand in a tin from jamaica which was fine i think this is a con you get all the rubbish about it being tested in jamaica well i do not know who tests it but definitely not someone who likes good coffee i just do not understand how people say its any good maybe having paid so much for it its like the emperor s new clothes 
negative,17/10/20,while in jamaica my wife and i drank blue mountain coffer every day and loved it we even went on a bike tour of the blue mountains and purchased some coffee it came in a plain clear plastic bag and we could see the darkness of the roast we enjoyed that coffee in ocho rios we bought some bags of jablum you cannot see the darkness of the roast and all you can smell is the burlap bag when we opened it up it was a very light roast not much fragrance and once brewed the coffee tasted a lot like dirt we were very disappointed

negative,4/10/20,not what i expected at all there is no punch to these chips like i thought there would be not spicy or hot but rather just disgusting the flavor is off and the after taste is god awful i ate one corn chip and decided i did not care for them so i ate something else to get the flavor of poop out of my mouth because that is what these chips taste like and i can still taste these poo chips i will not be buying these chips again at all there blue corn chips are really great but the so called red powder they put on these is just so off 
negative,1/4/20,i am giving these two stars because they did taste sorta good at first but like the other reviewer said they do smell funny and they left a bad taste in my mouth and they are very salty i only cooked them for seconds the bag was still expanding when i stopped it but they smelled burnt when they were done they said to cook until it stopped expanding but thank goodness i did not do that nice idea but i do not think i will buy these again 
negative,8/5/20,i was so excited to receive the product i immediately cooked a bag what a disappointment the taste of the pork skins was there but it was buried by some spice that i did not enjoy i could not finish the bag my dog would not eat them either ans she eats everything including brusell sprouts i have had microwave pork skins that were good but i do not remember the brand so i will just have to do without
negative,18/6/20,a terrible product we follow the intructions and did not get the the pork rinds we only got pieces of pork skin
negative,20/8/20,too salty but that was not even the worst of the problems it has a weird texture i cooked it perfectly and tastes horrible if you have not eaten pork rinds before please stay away even the worst popcorn tastes better 
negative,1/6/21,was really dissappointed in product too salty and poor flavor convenience is what makes product worth purchasing if you like pork rinds 
negative,4/7/21,lowrey s has changed it is microwave pork rinds i used to love them the last order i received was put up in a generic paper container with really flimsy cellophane wrapping there is no writing on the paper sack whatsoever the taste is sub par as is the amount of rinds as i said i used to love the product i will buy no more lowrey s microwave pork rinds 
negative,5/2/20,giving the other bags of these to the local food shelf just seems too cruel better to throw them away i do not know what good the popping does except make them sort of hot they are too salty have a hideous flavor taste nothing like pork rinds they do not even taste as good as bad pork rinds they are also loaded with chemicals i want to avoid probably part of the source of the hideous flavor 
negative,22/7/19,i do not know if i got a bad batch or something but i could nt get these to cook right i followed the instructions and after about two minutes the bag stoped expanding i opened it and found everything badly burnt the next bag i waited about one and a half minutes i opened it and found half the chips uncooked i never could find a time that either left some uncooked or some burnt i shook the bags and scattered the chips inside them well before microwaving each time 
negative,2/2/20,i have fond memories as a kid of going to the swap meet with my parents getting the biggest bag of pork rinds they had and pouring as much hot sauce on them as you could handle now that pork rinds can be considered a health snack i bought this box thinking i could have a decent snack every day well they pop up great in a large enough microwave the issue is the seasoning there is way way way too much salt in the seasoning and adding additional hot sauce makes the experience that much more unenjoyable i now have these when i am pretty hungry and want to bring compact snack to a place where i know there will be a microwave but i will not be ordering these again once the box is finished oh and they are not hot nor spicy just salty 
negative,22/11/20,they are ok i guess but each bag has about a pound of salt in it you will find yourself brushing away salt from each piece just for it to taste somewhat decent also no matter what you set the timer on the microwave you will have little burn hardened pieces so you are not even getting a whole lot out of one bag 
negative,1/3/20,i received my shipment today and tried to microwave four bags using different time settings only one or two out of each bag microwave correctly i even put the unpopped on a plate as someone suggested and nothing i carefully followed directions for each bag if i could rate this a zero i would 
negative,23/11/20,i tried these and wanted to like them but just could not they did not seem to pop very well a lot of wasted product in the bag and they did not taste very good i will not be buying these again 
negative,5/4/21,i have bought this product many times and this time they are old or defective the bags do not puff up and rinds are flat stale burn when cooked i have tried different time settings and in different microwaves i am very dissapointed as this is a product i have been ordering for years guess i will have to call them and complain 
negative,27/4/20,yuck these do not taste good and they are quite tough better off buying the bags of rinds already prepaired 
negative,8/3/21,too much message gives it a nasty salty after taste i basically gave them away 
negative,30/1/20,ok but too salty they should make a low sodium version the spicy is better 
negative,22/7/19,could not get the bags to pop any edible pork rinds i tried several bags with no results i finally had to throw them out i was very dissapointed with this product 
negative,2/2/20,i hated the flavor of this product i ended up just giving it away at work who ended up giving it away to there friends 
negative,2/9/20,lowrey s bacon curls pork rinds ounce microwave bags are loaded with milligrams of salt that is all i tasted a pinch of salt would have been better 
negative,26/1/21,the bags catch fire in my microwave and that leaves most un popped and extremely over salted this product is inferior to other brands i have tried 
negative,9/1/21,not one member of my family including me like these extremely salty much too strong a bq taste to order more i purchased them on a recuring basis and i wish to cancel now i have received only one shipment cancel further shipments not to our taste at all these are lowery pork rinds 
negative,30/7/21,the taste was a little off to me and like with microwave popcorn not all of the bacon skins developed some were still very hard on the ends and others not developed at all i bought a box of these so i tried to perfect the technique several times with not much better outcomes all in all i will stick with the ready to go variety offered by frito lay and mission 
negative,30/10/20,the lowrey s microwave pork rinds that i received was unacceptable i ordered bags and the bags only popped of the bag all rinds popped but for the amount of the money that i paid for them i could have gone to the store and bought a bag already popped and gotten a full bag i feel that it should have popped at least half of the bag i understand that everyone is counting their pennies but i also think that the consumer should get something for their money i really enjoy this product but i probably will not order any more for this reason 
negative,3/8/20,a warning should be placed on the item description because this product contains monosodium glutamate message a dangerous excitotoxin which is problematic for many people there is no indication in the item description that this is the case i fully agree with another reviewer that this item also is so extremely salty that it cannot be consumed the message also heightens the very salty taste this item did puff up very nicely in the microwave but it was inedible because of the saltiness and all packages had to be thrown out for that reason i am surprised at the many excellent reviews of this product amazon com gets an a for their wonderful handling of this problem 
negative,29/1/21,horrible hemical taste extremely salty this was a complete waste of money after the first bag i will have to throw the whole box away 
negative,24/10/21,i tried to cook different bags of these only a fraction of product popped up the ones that managed to pop tasted overly salty and had an unusual flavor unfortunately they were not returnable so the rest will be going to the trash waste of 
negative,24/10/21,this is my first time and i cannot eat them they are all small hard peaces with only a frw puffie ones is there something wrong with my batch i cannot eat them or they would break my teeth am i doing something wrong i only cook them min 
negative,16/10/21,i was so excited when i heard about this product i love pork rinds but these have a nasty chemical smell and they really do not taste good at all do not waste your money i actually threw the remaining packages away they really suck 
negative,24/10/21,this is a great idea but just like baking a cake you cannot do it in a midrowave 
negative,25/9/21,i heated these up in the microwave and they do not microwave evenly some will be burnt and hard as a rock when others will be just right since you do not get very many in one bag and since about do not cook right you barely get any pork rinds and throw the rest away maybe i am not cooking them right but i followed the directions 
negative,19/10/21,i love chuckles so the temptation to buy some in bulk overtook my better judgement recently i do not know why but i was surprised to discover that each huge movie size box was mostly air and contained a small clear plastic wrapping with pieces of candy in it i am old enough to have fallen for this i ate them all quickly to quell my feelings of having been made an idiot out of yet again by air filled boxed nothingness chuckles is a great and classic candy but this packaging is quite deliberately deceptive and insulting i would shop for other packages at other sites should the chuckles urge overtake me yet again 
negative,20/10/21,love this cereal but i buy a oz box at costco for and sometimes am offered it with a box coupon its too high here
negative,19/10/21,i bought this product to get rid of black ants in my house it did not help at all i even tried mixing it with sugar and placing it where the ants used to go well they just do not go anywhere close to it it really looks like it repels the ants instead of attracting them i have not found yet a product that work for my ants except the spray that kills them instantly but i cannot spray it in the kitchen and i have ants all around the counter top even if it is cleaned to perfection 
negative,15/6/21,this tin must have been sitting on the shelf for a decade it was totally dried out when i opened it when treacle sponge pudding dries it smells nasty and cannot be reconstituted even with water and some heat total waste of money 
negative,4/8/21,for the price you pay and size of each cup you can really only make the smallest size you are getting taken with this purchase buy the traditional mix from any other company you will get a better value better taste and a richer texture this snot a horrible mix it tastes ok but it is nothing more than a decent cup of chocolate flavored water it has no thickness to it swiss miss or any other grocery store hot chocolate beats it hands down all you are getting with this is convenience of using k cups which is not much of one to begin with avoid it 
negative,4/8/21,it is so watery and weak i had to brew the smallest cup and then put in another pod to get a full cup of hot chocolate this makes the pods very expensive and not figure friendly each pod is calories so a full cup would be will not purchase anymore 
negative,18/7/21,the hot chocolate has a weird flavor to it i will not be buying this product again and will probably not consider any more green mountain products 
negative,18/10/21,i used the minimum cup size to try and maximize the chocolate taste this did not help but if you like a weak chocolate taste then you will like it 
negative,15/6/21,i do not like this product at all much tastier and cheaper to just use hot water and a packet of hot chocolate mix from nestle or swiss miss 
negative,4/8/21,this product would be better made with milk which of course then would not be for the keurig machine there are other brands i prefer 
negative,8/6/21,this hot chocolate is pretty blah not very chocolatey and certainly not very strong it is not the fault of the keurig the cafe escapes dark chocolate is way better 
negative,15/6/21,of course the keurig green mtn hot cocoa is the ultimate in convenience but frankly the flavor is not so hot best description is slightly chocolate flavored cardboard everything else about it is fine consistency ease of use but g m should ramp up the flavor with way more chocolate 
negative,4/8/21,i recommend this instead for the same price swiss miss hot cocoa mix milk chocolate count envelopes pack of this thing falls short i found myself adding some milk or my non dairy creamers to my cup of this to make it taste somewhat creamy it more or less tastes horrible otherwise after i hated it i decided to make it with a cup of hot milk i just decided to pour it into a hot cup of milk and it tastes so much better in my opinion they need to up the powdered milk in them or the non dairy creamer in them it would improve this product so greatly they are thieves nonetheless you usually get envelopes of hot cocoa that tastes better than this in the supermarket for less than five bucks buy two for less than ten and still be spending less than what i spent with these i really thought i was buying quality this is definitely not unless i use milk which is like cheating myself and spending extra money i have drank common hot cocoa from supermarket straight with water that tasted way better than this avoid 
negative,25/9/21,the hot chocolate is fine but the price here is crazy you can get the same thing on the keurig site for under 
negative,19/10/21,i had high hopes for the convenience of this product my daughter loves hot chocolate this really was a total disappointment i threw these kcups out if you use the smallest setting on your keurig you get oz of watery hot chocolate larger settings are not drinkable save your money and get cocoa packets or a good tin of hot cocoa and take advantage of the instant hot water the keurig provides 
negative,4/9/21,i was expecting a bit better after reading other reviews this is about the same as any other hot chocolate made with water i prefer making it with milk as the flavor and texture is much better adding milk did not help much i guess mom spoiled me good 
negative,31/8/21,this is some of the worst stuff i have ever tried to drink it is even worse than that awful stuff that comes out of those machines where the cup drops down and fills it i tried it on the various cup size settings with my keurig machine and it just goes from bad to horrible when going from the larger size to the smallest it is a complete waste of money i just tried another brand that is similar and it is no good either if you like chocolate water buy these if you have it in mind that you are buying hot chocolate with a milky or creamy flavor that is not what this stuff is yuck 
negative,9/10/21,this time forget ordering through amazon you can get the same product k cups for at big cat or for at keurig these prices are a rip off 
negative,15/6/21,i used the small cup setting and even opened up the cap and scraped the excess mix out of the cup and it is still very weak tasting 
negative,4/8/21,i love green mountain coffee i use it all the time for my k cups i got a sample of the green mountain hot cocoa and thought it would be the best i actually threw it out i tried several times to drink it it tasted bitter and like chemicals i have tried samples of the other brands of hot cocoa and this by far was the worst i was so surprised because i adore their coffee i personally would not recommend this maybe it is the soy i do not know it just tasted very very odd i still would recommend their coffees though just to be fair i did add chocolate redi whip but i add that to all of my hot cocoa and it always tastes good 
negative,15/6/21,we fed this to our bulldog when she was a puppy and at first she did wonderful then the corn and preservatives took their toll she was itching and had a chronic ear infection and her face had a terrible yeasty smell all the time she licked her paws constantly and scratched her face raw on any surface she could find then she started vomiting we had to change her food now she eats a fully carnivorous raw diet and is thriving no more itching no more ear infections no more yeast no more paw licking 
negative,4/8/21,i wanted to give this product a try as the liquid honey crystallized in a few weeks during the winter months this small oz packet does clump together a lot more than other sweeteners so there is less of an advantage over using honey in a jar and spooning out the crystallized honey for the price i consider it a poor value taste is ok but nothing to rave about and not as good as with regular unprocessed honey 
negative,15/6/21,this is basically candy masquerading as a healthy snack they taste good because they have three different kinds of sugar in them blue diamond wants you to think that eating sugar is a healthy snack c mon i purchased these thinking they were sweetened with stevia yeah there is a miniscule amount of stevia very last ingredient but sugars are the and ingredient listed these have corn maltodextrin the worst thing there is on the glycemic index can you say fat formation now i am stuck with containers of this sugar snack 
negative,4/8/21,i purchased other types of blue diamond almonds on the same day and they were both around for a pack of t his one was only one oz container and i assumed it was at least containers since the cost was over 
negative,1/10/21,the delivery was extremely quick the packaging was fine and if you suck off all the honey the almonds even taste pretty good but i for one do not like this flavor mind you i could eat honey roasted peanuts 
negative,1/7/18,i would not recommend this oil it does not have a pleasant smell and does not purify the skin it is just like other oils i have bought from drug stores which were cheaper 
negative,10/8/18,i guess i am in the minority but i really did not like these much i was so excited for a cheesecake flavor when i saw it but these were disappointing the bars are super sickly sweet with a weird chemically fake vanilla ish undertaste absolutely no cheesecake or cream cheese type flavor and even the graham layer is just sweet without any real graham cracker taste the overall texture is slightly gritty and gummy not at all creamy sizewise they are smallish but pretty standard for any of the many calorie ish snack pack foods similar in price as most granola and snack bars none of which are ever much of a good value overall while they are not inedible or anything i would not buy these again and i do not even think i will bother with the rest of the box 
negative,1/7/18,ingredients on deep river snacks s website are potatoes sunflower oil and or corn oil whey sea salt onion powder sugar garlic powder torula yeast dried parsley maltodextrix canola oil soybean oil rosemary extract and natural flavors false adversing much 
negative,10/8/18,these chips are very spicy to say the least my tongue burned too much to finish the small individual serving bag they have an overpowering amount of some asian spice perhaps ginger but it is way too strong and you are left with a very unpleasant taste i bought of the small size bags but could not bring myself to like the flavor it all ended up in the trash this is definitely a chip that will appeal to only certain palates i do like the sweet onion flavor of this brand but this asian flavor was too much of a good thing 
negative,13/9/18,the sweet maui onion tastes like sour cream and onion i was hoping to get the delicious chips that i enjoyed in maui do not wast your time 
negative,17/7/18,i love salt vinegar kettle chips so i decided to try these after reading good reviews when i received them i noticed from the very first bag that over half of the chips were inedible due to rotten potatoes i know how kettle chips should look and i know what normal marks look like on chips these were rotten after waiting over a month for a response from the company i finally found a phone number and called them only to be told there was nothing they could do the sad thing is the chips that were edible were actually flavorful and tasty obviously they just do not care about consistent quality so stay away from these chips 
negative,16/1/19,the kettle chip itself is crisp crunchy and good although somewhat greasy over coated with the flavoring causing mouth burn when it was not expected in a chip with rosemary flavoring leaves greasy gritty residue on fingers after two or three chips 
negative,16/1/18,i have got to believe these other reviewers have not actually looked at the list of ingredients that make up these chips here they are ingredients sugar partially hydrogenated palm kernel oil coconut oil lactose whey natural and artificial flavors including barley protein non fat milk buttermilk solids sodium caseinate soy lecithin an emulsifier salt artificial colors yellow lake yellow lake blue lake now i must admit that i did not look at the label either i have been using nestle s chocolate chips for years and i thought it was a name i could trust apparently not so let me tell you how i discovered what the ingredients were i was making brownies for the kids for a semi special occasion so i bought the premium white morsels thinking they were white chocolate and these butterscotch ones i dumped them in my batter and noticed when i took the brownies out that the chips did not seem to have melted i did not think anything of it until i sampled some of the white morsels for a snack very waxy on the tongue not nice like good chocolate would be so i tried the butterscotch ones where the heck was the flavor well i was shocked when i read the label i had no idea that the white chocolate had been reformulated to be chocolate free and i assume that in the past these chips actually had some sort of natural butterscotch element to them instead of being made of barley protein and artificial flavorings i mean look at the ingredients there is more artificial flavors by volume than butter and milk and there is a whopping grams of sugar in teaspoon of these things which would be acceptable for cooking sweets if it was not for the grams of trans fats laden goo that was also in them in any case i have thrown out the rest of these two bags if the health concerns were not bad enough they do not taste good really sweet more than flavorful and waxy on the tongue when you eat them au naturel pam t mom blogger brownie baker
negative,16/1/19,i was wondering how my cookies which were a spin on the america s test kitchen perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe could have come out tasting like crud well it was the butterscotch chips i basically took atk s recipe and adjusted it for oatmeal insead of the chocolate chip by using their base and adding oats raisins chopped mac nuts cinnamon and these chips it would have been just as amazing as the chocolate chip cookie recipe if i would have ommitted these chips now as another reviewer said the cookies with the chips in it are destined for the trash 
negative,1/8/20,this lemon salt is ok but the salt is not infused with the lemon the lemon is mixed with salt granuals so might as well use lemon 
negative,1/7/18,i bought these cookies after reading all the rave reviews but they were very dry did not have much chocolate and left an unpleasant aftertaste i do not understand what all the fuss is about if these were the only gf cookies available i still would not buy them again 
negative,10/8/18,these cookies are small grainy and very crunchy with an awful aftertaste and very expensive for such a small package of cookies might be great for multiple allergies but i was very disappointed 
negative,15/2/20,as a mom with celiac disease with one son that has a tree nut allergy and another that has a soy allergy i really wanted to like these cookies we are used to cooking everything from scratch to ensure the safety of our food would not it be great to have a cookie that my tree nut allergic son and i could grab on the go i paid a visit to my local starbucks to pick up a oz pack of the sugar cookies and excitedly opened the package the smell alone was enough to immediately turn me off the bag had a synthetic odd smell inside i took a bite of the cookie and noted its crunchiness a good thing about the cookie but then was overwhelmed by an extremely unpleasant aftertaste it almost tasted like burnt popcorn with an artifical butter flavor a very odd and unpalatable taste indeed i was so disappointed i really liked the story of dr lucy and the idea of the cookie but most definitely did not like the cookie although i would classify myself as a bit of a food snob with high standards i put that aside when reviewing this cookie i do not think even the less discerning customer would enjoy this cookie 
negative,22/4/21,i bought a package of these at starbucks and thought good crispy hmmmm so i bought a case of a mix cinnamon sugar chocolate chip and oatmeal first they all tasted the same they are probably suppose to be crispy but they taste stale and then they leave an awful aftertaste they also taste way to buttery and a portion side is two cookies and the rest are all cracked in the package there is nothing special about these and are not worth the price although i love the packaging sorry lucy i have tasted way better gf cookies 
negative,25/9/20,these are the worst gluten free cookies i have ever tasted they were hard dry and tasted like tapioca flour avoid these at all cost 
negative,16/11/19,i do not have any dietary restrictions i bought these because of an price reduction i would not purchase them again they have very few chocolate chips like you have to hunt for them in the cookie that is not what chocolate chip cookies should be about the oatmeal version of these cookies is much better 
negative,9/9/20,these almonds had an unbelievable amount of salt on them i love salt but this was over the top i have bought this brand from other stores and they have never been this salty maybe the machine went wacko when processing these i cannot eat these unless i take the time to try and wipe off the salt which talks forever 
negative,1/7/18,i bought blue diamond natural chocolate almonds before natural almonds it was good but this one made me feel sick i only eat for the day i do not know if it is the salt or something else with this but i have to throw this away i cannot even move to workout i am hoping i can sleep this off but i guess i am the in million that this happens to 
negative,10/8/18,when in jamaica i drink jbm coffee and have come to develope a fine appreciation for the bean what i opened this morning was not what i had expected to be clear i was greatly dissapointed i found bits of husk from the bean which does not make coffee and is considered filler the flavor left something to be desired as well it tasted like folgers coffee without all the acid i was hoping to leave a great review of this product but honesty forbids it 
negative,15/1/20,a co worker of mine went to jamaica for vacation in february and bought me a bag of the ground it is expiration date was march i brewed it as soon as i got home to me it tasted like cheap coffee that had been left out in the open air for a week i wonder if it was due to the expiration date or does this coffee really taste like this if so i will never buy again from all the hype i was expecting much more 
negative,1/9/20,i bought the top sirloin hoping to finally get a good steak at home the first ones we cooked could hardly cut with a steak knife the second time we tried them i tenderized for quite some time they were more edible that way but still nothing better than i could have bought at the local grocery store except for the packaging there is nothing good i can say about these steaks if you figure the price per pound these steaks should cut with a butter knife will never buy again 
negative,22/7/21,you get bags for in each bag is about a handleful of pretzels the taste is ok but not worth a dollar a bag 
negative,1/7/18,these pretzels have a nice crunch and a lot of nutritional value but their flavor is very bland bland with a hint of cinnamon i wish i would tried a single bag before buying an entire bag box but they are not available in stores at least where i live and the reviews seemed fairly positive on the bright side they do leave you feeling comfortably full for minimal calories a recommended diet food for those who have the fortitude to place higher priority on protein dense snacking rather than flavor 
negative,10/8/18,the label on the little bag says serving is calories but one serving is ounce the little single serving sized bag is ounces so there are calories in the bag this is sneaky no one is going to open their bag and measure out one ounce then save the other half ounce edited to add i ordered these again because the price went down momentarily is now back up and the product is now changed although amazon still had it listed at ounce bags what i got is oz bags so now yes one bag is a serving but the nutrition facts do not add up to what was listed before now a bag has calories and carbs another sneaky move you get less for the same price 
negative,14/5/21,i have heard people describe horrible food as tasting like cardboard before i never quite knew what they meant until now this really does taste like cardboard i do not think i could give these a way they are trash do not waste your money here is a better low carb sweet snack blue diamond almonds cinnamon brown sugar ounce jars pack of 
negative,17/10/19,its not that this coffee sucks its that it does not begin to measure up to all the hoopla its well balanced but that is about it even a little old tasting nothing special in the least what sweet caramel finish cannot believe this is the same coffee the star reviews are about
negative,3/10/21,this tea is an excellent herbal tea love the taste and it is not as weak as most herbal tea is i used to get it from the commissary on base but they stopped stocking it so i checked on amazon most wanted to sell by the case but anneeavon sold them in single packages and i swear it said and free shipping when ordered from this seller above the add to cart button i ordered last night and opened my e mail this afternoon to find they charged me shipping for each of the boxes i ordered and the estimated arrival time is a week away for that kind of money i would expect overnight for that kind of money i could have gotten a couple cases and had change it is probably my fault for miss reading something but just be aware of the shipping charges on anneeavon products 
negative,15/9/20,it is not an amazing tea it is an okay tea i buy regular green tea at asia market for way cheaper price and i get same result i look for saving money will not repurchase 
negative,30/8/20,my dogs have been enjoying these treats for years and we have ordered this many times from amazon in the past however our last order was a big disappointment the description of exactly how much of this product you will receive is very unclear so when i saw that the product weight is lbs and the shipping weight is lbs naturally i expected to receive a minimum of three one pound bags as we have in the past not so amazon outrageously charged us for a single one pound bag of dried lamb lungs you would think i was buying caviar the treats were promptly packed back up and returned tsk tsk tsk amazon so stars for the product itself stars for amazon this time 
negative,1/7/18,this was gross it lamb lund smelled bad there hard chips my dogs favorite is the texas taffy that is a winner i cut it into peices she loves them 
negative,10/8/18,i love this sugar i have been using it packaged in envelopes for a year or two for everything gives a great homemade taste to cookies and packaged in envelopes see sugar in the raw raw sugar ounce bags pack of it is wonderful stuff but not in this packaging if you do not use the whole pounds right away the boxes of sugar turn hard as a rock have to microwave them pound them with a hammer and then pour the sugar into a plastic envelope with a sugar bear e g jbk bear terra cotta brown sugar saver to make it possible to use it definitely not worth it buy it packaged in bags or not at all 
negative,5/12/19,these are tasty enough for an emergency snack lunch i keep a few in my file cabinet but our local meijer s sells them for apiece even the discount price here is twice that 
negative,21/10/19,i went for these when i got a free bucks to spend with a new amazon credit card and i am glad i did not pay full price i was in the process of creating an authentic bolognese meat sauce and i wanted some very hearty mushrooms to add a bit of oomph to the sauce which is meat and onion heavy and i figured from the reviews that these are a meaty tasting mushroom i also see the price asked for these at our local giant eagle grocery stores so yeah i did get a bargain from their rip off pricing but these are basically taking up freezer space i ordered two grades a higher grade with bigger shroom pieces less stems etc and in retrospect should have just ordered the scraps or even the dust as i found the big pieces stayed a nasty tough chewy texture even after hours of cooking i also extracted just juice from the mushrooms but the broth was not strong enough to bother i basically just chop these in the food processor and add a lot of them to get a change in flavor in recipes the one ounce bags do not even bother with because it takes a lot to get some flavor from them in all honesty i have not used another poricini product so i cannot compare but i am disappointed with the results i got from these it may be they do exactly what they are supposed to for some one with a very tender palate but not for me and in no case are these ever going to be rehydrated and served on steak they just stay too nasty of a product to serve by themselves strictly good for grinding and using in a recipe 
negative,8/9/20,this product is a waste of money it is bitter bitter and salty salty save your money and by the peaches instead libby s unpeeled apricot halves in pear juice from concentrate ounce cans pack of 
negative,22/9/21,upon opening the package i thought that the tea had absolutely no aroma and looked old as if it was sitting somewhere in an open container for months after brewing it revealed a bland taste at best it was like drinking brewed hay i checked the expiration date which is two years from now maybe i had a bad batch but it is going back i had a better experience with rishi organic jasmine pearl loose leaf tea i do not recommend this tea to anyone 
negative,2/10/20,in order for tea to be labeled decaff is must be under caffeine when residue levels are tested a tea at caffeine is not decaff non decaff tea is anywhere between caffeine so at caffeine this is a caffeinated tea with caffeine slightly less than what is naturally present in the tea leaf 
negative,25/7/20,unfortunately all package size descriptions on the product page are wrong these are not packages and they are also not packages as stated further down in the description they are packages very disappointed in this fact cherryheads are tasty though and the shipping was fast 
negative,4/7/21,these are from china and nowhere as good as those from italy spend the extra money and get those from italy 
negative,11/9/21,amazon pirated my personal image for their listing it is not a stock image i created it and put my website name on it looneystuff com for use on my website i have asked them to take my image down from this listing 
negative,4/7/21,this pecan meal is more like bran flakes than pecans i had thought it was ground pecans and the name would indicate that the container it came in is very light which was my first clue it was not exactly the whole pecan nut meat the meal is flaky the price might have been a clue i suppose since the per pound price of pecans is over most places 
negative,21/9/21,we purchased the pretzels to make chocolate covered wedding favors for our guests the pretzels would not have been bad for anything else but there were way too many broken ones we would have had to buy five more barrels my only complaint now is that we shipped them back over a month ago and still have not received our refund 
negative,11/9/21,they may have great products but shipping is incredibly slow shipped days after i placed the order not yet received and the shipping price is unreasonable 
negative,12/10/21,do not be fooled this is not a health cereal the second ingredient is sugar and this cereal also has fructose in it i feel like i am eating kid cereal it would be healthy if it had less sugar in it carb conscious people and diabetics beware 
negative,11/10/21,i tried this once and just tossed a whole box in the garbage the cereal looks like cinnamon toast crunch but it taste like some sort of fake caramel substitute it has a powdery coating that is worse than the butt end of a regular box of cereal with all the broken crumbs in the bottom the carmel flavor tastes fake and almost made me gag a few times 
negative,28/9/21,fiber one products actually do not have real fiber they contain inulin from chicory root which is technically fiber because the body cannot digest it unfortunately fiber is defined by anything that cannot be broken down easily these products do not contain real fiber the real fiber usually found in whole grain breads and bran cereals so if it says chicory root or inulin in the ingredients you can be sure you are not eating the fiber your body can actually use so if you want lots of sugar and fat without fiber this product is for you 
negative,19/10/21,actually typed in smoked paprika this showed up so i ordered it and it is definatly not smoked also these bottles sell for at sam s so not only was it the wrong item but i over paid also 
negative,4/7/21,it is all cayenne and not authentic bebere way too spicy threw it out and made my own 
negative,11/9/21,my finicky cats would not eat this food so i gave it to my neighbor who rescues cats so the food would not go to waste 
negative,12/9/21,when we first bought these we tried to eat one and could not looked at the ingredients and found its mostly pig hearts taste is awful our dog however thinks they are great so we cut them up in small pieces and hide them around for him or forage out by smell after about a week the contents of the bag start to mold since they are for the dog we washed them off and then store in the fridge too bad we had hoped these would be good snacks for football parties etc not recommended for people food 
negative,13/7/21,oberto cocktail pep used to be so much better than this i had been buying them direct from the oberto online store for many years and i could not get enough no matter what size i ordered they were always excellent however in the past few years the quality of their cocktail pep has sure gone down they used to be very tight and snappy when you would bite into them the outer casing of each sausage was almost totally smooth because they were packed so tightly and they had a superior spicy flavor nowadays they are all soft and mushy with bland often stale flavor i get the impression that they are cutting corners to save a buck by not stuffing each sausage casing as tightly as they once did i believe this allows more air to permeate the meat and causes the bad flavor that many people are complaining about every year or so i get to craving those old style cocktail pep that i loved so much and i order a package hoping that they will have changed i keep thinking maybe i just got a bad batch last time but every time i am disappointed all over again 
negative,23/10/21,when i first took a bite i seriously thought i was eating dog food these are disgusting i searched the bag for dog food and the expiration date thinking that it was bad for one of those reasons i do not know how anyone can like these 
negative,22/9/21,they taste more like chemicals than meat i like a lot of jerky and meat sticks but would not eat these the dogs liked them though 
negative,4/7/21,oh boy oberto cocktail pep smoked sausage sticks ounce bag purchased on this was the worst product i have ever tasted i have had many oberto products and this was nothing like what i have eaten before even my dog would not eat them they were so nasty tasting 
negative,11/9/21,a word of caution to anyone considering buying these read the ingredients first i made the mistake of thinking they would be the same as the longer oberto brand ones our local costco used to sell so i ordered up bags to get the volume discount offered at the time i knew something was not right as soon as i opened up the first bag and got a whiff then i read the ingredients and was shocked when i saw that they actually use pork hearts as the top ingredient to eliminate any doubt i tasted one we have been using them as expensive doggy treats ever since 
negative,8/8/21,these quickly became dog treats just nasty i do not even know how they can sell these for human comsumption stay away 
negative,9/7/21,only good use for these would be in case of poisoning use to induce vomiting 
negative,24/10/21,very expensive and not worth the price try purityfarm organic ghee it is much cheaper and taste much better than this ghee do not waste your money 
negative,4/7/21,i received this item and there was a tear in the packaging which had caused the dragees to spill all over the inside of the box they arrived in this is not very surprising due to the type of plastic it is packaged in the sort which immediately rips open at the slightest puncture but as such it should have been packaged for shipping more carefully perhaps wrapped it in small bubble wrap and taping it securely as i have seen done with other less fragile items i have ordered i was especially annoyed however that there is no way of returning it that is just outrageous very very dissatisfied i have now tried ordering similar pearl dagrees from wilton wilton sugar pearls white oz which incidentally are less than half the price i should say that generally my experience with amazon and returns has been excellent the few dragees left in the package were beautiful uniform in shape and tasty i view this as an isolated incident due to the particular characteristics of this product its packaging however it could have been handled better 
negative,11/9/21,why in the world would amazon want to sell an item and say can be ingested when it clearly has ingredients that can because cancer wish every state would wake up like california and ban all these cancer causing things 
negative,24/10/21,i like the idea of getting grains out of cat food but using peas instead does not seem to be the answer carnivores at least my cat does not tolerate peas vomiting began in about weeks and is now instantaneous eat some cat food go right to throwing up both chicken and salmon so for me it was a waste of money and very disappointing 
negative,22/6/21,i bought a couple of flavors from halo s both were not a hit with my cats unfortunately my cats would not touch it 
negative,30/7/21,it taste okay but they are not soft and the taste does not stay very long i would not buy them again 
negative,10/7/21,i had a good experience with other amazon grocery products and these were a good deal so i bought a three pack they were not horrible but they do not taste the same as the ones you buy in the store they taste like cheap generic chocolate chip cookies which is not necessarily bad but not what i expected for the price and chips ahoy brand they are cheaper tasting a little stale and much less chocolate chips i have not had store bought chips ahoy for a few months so maybe they changed the formula for all these cookies but if not then these seem to be cheap knock offs made with cheaper ingredients 
negative,4/7/21,my kids loves chips ahoy and i will have them once in a while as well but the kids refuse to eat them from this family size package once i tasted them i knew why they have an awful medicinal taste really bad i do not what the problem is but if you like chips ahoy you will not like these go elsewhere 
negative,11/9/21,product is good my cats like it but the price just keeps climbing i will have to train my cats to eat cheaper cat food 
negative,20/9/21,drawer is much larger than it appears in photo and takes up much more space on the cabinet surface the drawer is sticky and not easily opened or closed i would not purchase again 
negative,13/10/21,ordered both had bent tracks and i actually cut my finger on one of the wires sticking out but you get what you pay for 
negative,2/8/21,looks good but does not open and close smoothly the drawer has medal feet that fit into a groove in the bottom of the unit as a track the tray sticks a lot and you have to hold the top of the unit to jerk the drawer out 
negative,11/6/21,i have never taken the time to write a review before but in this case others need to be warned off i expected to get a product similar to what i have seen in the stores but this obviously is a replica the sliders on the bottom of the tray that are supposed to keep the tray straight when you slide it in and out broke off before i even got it out of the package it is not something you can fix unless you have a solder gun even then it is very sticky pulling the tray out because there are no rollers it is metal on metal which does not work well without some sort of lubrication i love amazon but this product is inferior at best 
negative,2/8/21,i have been looking at this holder since i saw it at the at my office today i found it at bb b for it works great but too expensive at amozon 
negative,18/10/21,i have tried many flavors of erin baker s breakfast cookies and until i tried this one i liked them all the ingredients list mentions that they have a touch of carrot cake spice added but it is more than a touch unless you really really love carrot cake you might want to make a different flavor selection my favorite is the chocolate chunk cherry but it appears it is only seasonal i wish i could get it all year long the oatmeal raisin is my second favorite i wish i had ordered them instead of these morning glory 
negative,23/7/21,i really wanted to like these but i just found them to be to sweet sugary i generally stay away from cliff bars for the same reason and had hoped that these would be as good as they sound sadly its just to sweet tasting for me special note the packs i received oct have sugar not the listed in the amazon nutrition section there may have been a recipe change 
negative,8/7/21,not kosher ignore the symbol they are not kosher and not certified by any company i contacted the company to confirm 
negative,11/6/21,we picked these up based on the glowing reviews my fault my mistake i believe they are way over rated does not taste morning glory at all instead tastes just like any one of the other in the line dry stale dense oatmeal cookie like a cookie experiment gone bad by a pre teen in addition cookies arrived cracked broken and sticking to bag yet are dry stale inside what a waste i would have never purchased these in a b m store had i had an opportunity to examine them first 
negative,25/6/21,the breakfast cookie is not to my liking and i do not think i will order them in the future 
negative,2/8/21,i was disappointed by my first taste of kopali organics chocolate covered dried banana the chocolate is waxy and the bananas too soft for me i was expecting more crunch a drier banana the banana did not taste of banana to me either i will not purchase again 
negative,11/6/21,it clearly states on the description pack of but i only got and i cannot find how to complain about this i do not want to return 
negative,9/7/21,sesmark makes a very high quality rice cracker and then proceeds to ruin it by loading it up with so much salt as to make it inedible use caution before buying this item since there are no returns and you might find yourself with a throw away 
negative,22/6/21,super bubble is my very favorite gum and very hard to find here the box i received was a real hit or miss more than half the gum was brick hard totally unchewable i have never run across this issue with this product and am very disappointed i will take a chance and buy it again sometime in the future but this particular purchase left a bad taste in my mouth 
negative,2/8/21,i would like to try this however i do not see anything that says exactly what this product is made of did i miss something they only say what it is not would really like to know 
negative,11/6/21,i purchased my order of miracle noodle directly from i got them for my mother because she needs to switch to a diet of less carbs and far less calories overall i purchased the pack of angel hair noodles for w for shipping for a total of a few days later i received the package i was very surprised to find out that each package of miracle noodles actually contained over ounces of water and less than oz of noodles while their marketing material does barely mention water content they are neither clear nor particularly forthcoming about this fact nor the fact that it accounts for over of the purchase product and considering the fact that they instruct you to immediately rinse the noodles before use it is not as if your supposed to prepare the noodle using this water well for a couple of reasons including but not limited to the water volume i decided to return them without opening even package so they were completely unused i was instructed during a phone call to their main office to mail them back at my expense and was told that i would receive a full refund well it cost me approx another to ship them back due to the water weight and a few days later i received a refund of i paid shipping both ways so basically i paid in shipping to get a so called refund i paid and got back only this may be legal but it is unethical and wrong and when i spoke to the rep on the phone this was never mentioned especially for a company that claims to stand behind it is product when i contacted them by email they informed me that this is our policy and cited the requisite schpeal on their website i was not informed of this on the phone call at all this so called policy should be changed it may be legal but it is hardly ethical or right when is ok to get back only half of what you spend when you return a product it is not not to mention the fact that you are getting less than oz of noodle in a oz package ridiculous oh and to make matters worse when i commented on their shipping policy and water weight on their facebook fan page instead of addressing the issues openly honestly and directly they immediately and repeatedly deleted my comments and then blocked me from making comments at all what is that tell you 
negative,8/7/21,the shipment was prime but arrived in days instead of i love dark french roast coffee but this coffee tasted burnt and additionally the flavor had overtones of trash indonesian not a pleasant experience 
negative,28/9/21,the juniper plant i received died within a month of planting after i did some research i found that it does the best outside of the home which eve s garden failed to mention in the product instructions i gave it one star because it shipped well and was fun while it lasted i will not be getting anything from this manufacturer again 
negative,23/8/21,the bonzai i ordered came well before the estimated date however the tree i got as a gift was tiny nothing like it looks like in the product picture 
negative,1/8/21,i know others like salt more than i do but i am not on a salt free diet or anything like that i love sausage but this was way too salty for my taste 
negative,16/7/21,the taste is bitter the smell is atrocious and they are not naturally smoked aqueous natural smoke is a chemical stew injected into the fish for anyone thinking these are the real thing all i can say is there is a sucker born every minute 
negative,2/8/21,i adore sardines i am used to the bela brand but decided to try these for variety s sake i opened up a can and it smelled like nasty cat food i tasted them anyway but was totally grossed out in the trash it went stick with bela super clean flavor fresh and better sourced totally different food product try them with siracha 
negative,11/6/21,ingredient list sugar acidity regulator including miscellaneous chemicals no tea whatsoever for oz of sugar with apple flavor most expensive sugar in the market health benefit none it comes in a square tin with plastic bag inside containing granulated sugar that is all nothing more 
negative,26/6/21,i ordered two of the hazer baa turkish apple tea pack of as pictured so i would save on the shipping and instead received the green apple tea same brand and price it did not taste like the original but i did not want the hassle of sending it back and so i will not be ordering it again this tea did not have the strength or zing of the original i am upset still 
negative,20/8/21,the eggnog was not eggnog they should try another name as this is misleading the cartons are really difficult to open i use a screwdriver 
negative,25/8/21,yes dogs love these treats but educate yourself before you buy any dog treats made in china per abc news just six months after issuing its latest warning about chicken jerky dog treats made in china the food and drug administration confirms it has logged more than complaints from pet owners who say their dogs either were sickened or died after eating the treats the number of complaints has nearly doubled since the story was first reported by abc news in march the fda says its investigation is ongoing and that it continues to test samples of the popular treats which dog owners across the country say have caused kidney failure in their pets resulting in severe illness or death 
negative,19/10/21,please research on the web this product nearly killed my dog all of dogswell jerky treats are poison made in china this dist does not seem to care he is killing our pets fda told me dogs have died from these kind of dog treats beware i have over in vet bills amazon please do not sell this line to us talk with the fda dogswell happy hips for dogs chicken breast ounce pouches pack of find another product made in the usa before more of our furry friends get sick or die 
negative,2/8/21,i honestly do not know how this product could have garnered so many five star reviews i bought it for my senior dogs years old when their usual joint treats pet naturals of vermont soft chews were out of stock since one of my dogs is very finicky about what glucosamine supplements he will take and i had tried everything else available without success i gave both of them the recommended dosage based on their weights and lbs and was delighted to see that they happily accepted the treats within hours though my yorkie had raging diarrhea and my eskie poo had vomited forcefully which was very unusual for both of them not realizing it was this product i tried it again a couple of days after nursing them back to health with the exact same effect internet searches confirmed that other users have similarly reported nasty gi side effects with this product 
negative,11/6/21,my dog loves chicken breast treats that is until i bought these i am sure this is simply a matter of taste i do not know if the additives smell different or what is turning him off but he will pick it up and then just drop it he refuses to eat them at all 
negative,22/10/21,i have fed the chicken and duck version of these though now the reviews regarding china i find disturbing regardless the beef liver version of these are not a hit with my pup and seem to be a very odd plastic texture the duck and chicken are both great but i will be investigating the source of the food 
negative,6/8/21,consumer lab reports that in dogswell happy hips the condroitin level is not acceptable to low
negative,24/6/21,originally these were made in us now made in china see back of bag advertised as natural cage free no hormones no fillers no antibiotics huh not in china i will not trust these as safe treats follow up my dogs vomited after they ate these original warnings from fda re chicken product from china a follow up was issued by the fda again on to remain vigilant and of concern if fed to smaller dogs update dec all chicken jerky remains a problem according to the fda product from china noted again to be of concern some dogs made ill from chicken jerky product recovered with treatment and others have died the email from my vet stated that the fda would like you to report if you have a problem with chicken jerky treats 
negative,17/4/21,i am disturbed that these treats as many reviewers state are so addictive my dog too loves them but has now begun to shun her meals and will only eat these treats in trying to make sense of her current state of anorexia i recently became aware of the fda advisory on december stating that one of the symptoms to be aware of in dogs eating chicken jerky treats made in china is decreased appetite although some may continue to consume the treats to the exclusion of other foods so be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats although the dogswell company states clearly that their product is not contaminated and that third party testers have confirmed this do the owners of the company truly know what is happening in china behind the scenes or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky i and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog s anorexia except that it coincides with her increased interest and now only interest in happy hips since i began treating her with them last spring thankfully her kidney function is still fine but if you research this on the web many other dogs were not so lucky and died due to kidney failure see this link to the fda website suggesting caution to consumers in using chicken jerky products from china be informed 
negative,10/3/21,i had bought this product last year my dog loved them but i subscribe to a couple of bichon frise newsgroup and they are saying not to feed these to your dog as they come from china i threw out what i had left for the outside critters in the forest i called dogswell today and they verified that even though they say you s on them they are still coming from china 
negative,17/4/21,please be aware that although dogs absolutely love these treats that they may have caused a recent unexplainable illness in our month old mastiff pup he was getting or a day of these chicken jerky s for about a week and then suddenly became very lethargic along with vomiting diarrhea and had no appetite except he would eat only these treats and drink water vet thinks he will recover ok but advised us to stop feeding them to our dogs these are still made in china and in reports had shown that dogs were getting sick from these and other brands and there are still reported cases today just be careful and watch your pets closely if you are feeding them these we will no longer feed these to any of our dogs ever wish dogswell would manufacturer these in the usa again 
negative,21/1/21,these chicken strips and most others like them are priced so low they are hard to resist my dogs love them of course and for dogs who tolerate chicken they should be excellent treats however i do not trust pet foods sourced from china most of you should remember the melamine disaster of several years ago that killed and permanantly injured over ten thousand pets it remains almost impossible to determine the conditions under which chinese food products are produced and manufactured the rumors in the veterinary world i am a dvm are that the majority of the chickens used in these cheap products are dead before processing no one has any clue what if any adulterants are added many brands are irradiated if this matters to you overall i recommend purchasing pet food products that the manufacturer guarantees are made from us grown and processed ingredients 
negative,30/1/21,we have been ordering these chicken jerky treats for a long time with amazon subscribe and save my boston terriers really love them and get very excited to get their treat every morning when i opened a bag from my most recent shipment my dogs refused to take the treat from my hand they took one sniff and backed away my son s lab got very sick from chicken jerky made in china and his vet told him to only buy treats made in the you s and i am going to follow that advice 
negative,13/2/21,made in china does anything else need to be said i used to buy them then noticed the label i will not buy again 
negative,15/1/21,i am very disappointed that this happy hips product is made in china now if it was not for me going into a pet food store that does not carry products not made in the usa i would be still feeding this product to my dog i am really concerned on finding a new product due to my bichon s allergies she can only have lamb she now sits at the cabinet and cries for her treat i think i may need to make my own lamb jerkey in my dehydrator more work but worth it with no regulations in china who knows what is swept from the floors and put in the product as we know the packaging is misleading what is misleading in the ingredents i have been to china it is scary we take so much for granted in the usa dp
negative,6/3/21,my dogs loved this product and i was happy to spend the money on it but now that it is made in china thumbs down what were they thinking i will never buy it again there are better products made in the usa if you care about the well being of your dog you will avoid products made in china 
negative,8/6/21,i will no longer be giving these to my dog they caused my dog to have diarrhea and vomit when i did some more research online there were many many posts about how the treats caused their dogs to have similar and even much more severe health issues my dog loves these treats i have been giving these to her for about a year or two now every once in a while she would have diarrhea or start vomiting a yellow foamy substance in most cases both and i finally now linked it to these treats do your research before you buy this product however i would not recommend these at all 
negative,7/1/21,i wish i had read that these are made in china before i bought them they are going in the trash lesson learned 
negative,17/4/21,i bought this product last week for our dogs within a day both were vomiting and refusing food our larger dog is doing ok since we stopped feeding them but our little guy is not taking both to the vet tomorrow along with these treats 
negative,10/3/21,admittedly my dog loves these treats and thinks they are delicious however they are made in china and dog lovers in the us usually choose not to buy products from china due to prior problems with the quality control that has sickened many animals dogswell should take note of this and manufacture them in the us it should also be noted that competitive brands on your grocery store shelves are also made in china even though distributed in california the only brand i have found that is manufactured in the us is from trader joes if you love your dog do not buy this item go to trader joes 
negative,14/1/21,used to subscribe to this item as my dogs loved them but i just found that they are made in china i will never feed these to my dogs again or buy anything from the company 
negative,24/5/21, dogswell happy hips for dogs chicken breast ounce pouches pack of dogswell chicken jerky is now made in china the fda has warned against dog food products made in china do not risk it 
negative,14/10/21,i purchase almost daily from amazon and recommend amazon to my friends constantly i think that makes me a very good customer i have a very serious concern when amazon sells pet food and or treats made in china they must be disclosed on the amazon page as made in china no one who loves their pet will buy them but amazon will at least give us a fair chance to protect our beloved pets from these poisons imported from china as a loyal customer i expect amazon to protect me and my loved ones from hidden threats amazon must disclose the country of origin for all food products if amazon is too ashamed to disclose the source then amazon should not sell it 
negative,7/2/21,i used to buy these all the time and had no idea the switched to being made in china not trusting this company anymore they just lost another customer buyer beware 
negative,29/3/21,my dogs love duck treats and have been getting the chicken happy hips for years so i though i would give the duck a try bad idea the treat was too tough and stringy for my small female westie to pull apart and she ended up choking and vomiting i order by subscription and had to make cuts in the strips with a poultry shear to use up the bags i too hate the fact that these are made in china but my little guys need extra condroitin and glucosamine so i am back to the chicken formula 
negative,17/4/21,my dog absolutely loves these and she is very picky however i am returning them due to the numorous recent cases of illnesses and deaths occurring from chicken treats that have been manufactured in china it is not worth the risk to me sadly to say i will have to find another brand 
negative,10/3/21,my dogs loved these treats recently my yr old hound that has never been to the vet got sick could not keep anything down and after days of this we went to pet emergency later it was concluded that it was something digested not possible i spare no expense when it comes to my furry buddy s i grabbed the bags of treats and sure enough made in china went to fda web site in and they said chicken from china bad but no recalls yet dogs have been getting sick from chicken products from china advised not to buy called company and no return call trashed them all 
negative,10/7/21,my shih tzu loved these and i have been giving him these duck treats off and on for the past two years with no obvious problem even though they are made in china ordinarily i would not give my dog anything made in china but i could not find any duck treats made in the usa well recently i purchased a large package of these at a pets warehouse store i would wake up and find throw up and diarrhea in the house seemingly every time i gave him a duck treat the day before i did not want to believe it i thought perhaps his water bowl was slimy and cleaned it all was well i gave him another duck treat a few days later and he got sick again several hours later well i stopped giving him dogswell happy hips duck treats and he has been fine since then so i do not know if it is just a bad batch of treats or if he somehow became sensitive to these treats or if they are contaminated with something not going to take any more chances with this brand 
negative,27/1/21,my labrador loves all the treats from dogswell however all of the dogswell jerky treats i have come across are made in china as a dog lover i cannot knowingly give my dog a product from china it does say cage free but really i am not sure but dogswell jerky bars are made in the usa my dog loves this just as much so bad news on the regular jerky but upside dogswell has some usa products too 
negative,1/6/21,my dog loved these treats then one day i actually read the packaging and saw these are made in china i feel betrayed by this company who pretends they use organic free range chicken when really those words do not exist in chinese farming practices they buy meat from one of the largest makers of dog food in china a massive factory and are fully aware of the fda issued warnings about chicken products from china killing pets they state they test for everything but since the contaminant has not been pinpointed yet it is impossible to test for do not give your dog these treats do your research and read every label closely as they really try and fool you with the fine print 
negative,20/8/21,i have been buying dogswell chew treats for my dog for several years she is always loved them the most recent time i purchased them however she got seriously ill with heavy vomiting and lethargy i almost forgot about it but a few weeks later i found them in the back of the cabinet and tried them again she got very ill again especially since she is rarely sick it is difficult to ignore the link between these treats and her illness unless and until there is some quality control on these i highly recommend finding a different treat as for the issue of made in china i only looked at the packaging more carefully after reading some reviews and in fact the packaging clearly states that the product is made in china i find that pretty incredulous considering the claims on the packaging about all natural and even free range definately beware 
negative,14/8/21,i wish i had come to the amazon site before purchasing this product at my local wegman s the product of china was printed so small it was easy to overlook i am a little shocked that wegman s a local chain store known for quality was selling these treats in a big display the half open package is going in the trash and unopened bag is going back to wegman s for a refund and a piece of my mind 
negative,21/4/21,in my opinion its an outrage that these treats which used to be made in the us are now made in china the company did not advertize anywhere about this and we only found out accidentally while looking at the wrap for ingredients let me start my review stating that many of the current star ratings here look suspiciously fake made up its hard to imagine anyone writing something positive about them unless they fail to see reviews clearly warning buyers about these treats being made in china hard to blame chinese to manufacture them but its dogwells fault for not realizing dangers of making them there with their poor record in food manufacturing from the past with food poisoning in pet food 
negative,1/4/21,i had been buying my year old bichon frise these happy hips duck treats for months until recently when i purchased a large bag that upon opening it reeked of some sort of chemical substance which smelled very much like chlorine or bleach the smell was overwhleming and disgusting not knowing what was wrong with it just out of curiosity i looked on the back of the bag to read the contents and sure enough at the bottom of the bag were those dreaded words made in china up until this time i had assumed their treats were made in the usa and some of them are but after looking through all their products it seems that their duck and chicken breast treats come from china do not trust this product 
negative,17/4/21,i did not mind paying the a bag because my dog loved them these are so expensive that i did not look on the bag to see where they were made until another recent recall on chinese dog treats food that was killing dogs when i looked at the happy hips bag i was pretty ticked off to see that these are made in china i used to joke that my dog was addicted to these but now i am actually a little concerned that there may be some addictive substance in these chinese treats 
negative,10/3/21,i used to get these instore and found a cheaper deal on amazon i recently realize when you open the bag there is a strong smell like plastic or chemicals i tried a little bit myself and the smell is just so strong that i cannot bear it i tossed everything everything away and would not buy this again it is made in china you do not know what they put in the chicken strips to get them addicted or sick avoid 
negative,22/4/21,all of the veterinary products made in china are potentially dangerous to your pet do not buy pet products made in china along with the melamine issues of a few years ago there have been reports of salmonella on these so called treats additionally there are no good studies showing any efficacy of glucosamine for the treatment of arthritis and amazon should make it easier to find the country of origin of all of their products 
negative,25/4/21,i placed an order for dogswell happy hips for dogs beef liver on on july when my current supply was used up i opened the new batch started with one pouch and then a second pouch for the first time the product does not appear to be healthy and fresh instead of being solid brown hard and crispy the beef liver pieces are soft pliable and some have a whitish powdery covering on them i am afraid to feed these to my dogs or other dogs that i meet in the park i have been buying this product for years and this is the first time it does not look and feel right i am going to try to get an exchange hoping that this is just a bad batch one thing i did notice when the package arrived and that is the long tall plastic bag was substituted with a horizontal short bag that did not fit the pouches very well my guess is that another manufacturer is making this dog treat not the original one and that is the reason for the inferior and unhealthy quality of the treats 
negative,1/4/21,i have bought these for a long time and felt better about the product because i believed them to be of american origin i purchased several bags strips wrapped apples etc and now realize the country of origin is china with all the fda regulations about packaging it is about time it was mandated that country of origin be prominently displayed like in font type not microscopic writing no one notices on the front of the package as a result i will no longer purchase dogswell products as an aside rawhide is an even worse offender since the dog can get a much higher dose of any toxins used in curing the hide and you can bet there are plenty i even picked up a package of a brand named something like you s a rawhide and on the back in fine print was made in china why are not our legislators doing something productive and cracking down on this it is sneaky at best and intentionally deceptive at worst amazon please find us products for our furry kids that will not make them sick or kill them 
negative,30/6/21,my dog used to love these i thought i was was giving him a great treat that was actually a supplement to improve his arthritis symptoms then his liver enzymes were elevated and he was becoming less active and always thirsty thank goodness a friend sent me a link about the fda warnings since hundreds of dogs have died very painful and expensive deaths if you love your dog go to the fda website yourself and do not buy these treats 
negative,1/3/21,my otherwise healthy papillon was doing great before feeding these to him he is normally pretty fussy about which treats he likes so when i found these i thought i had hit a gold mine however over time i saw behavior changes a normally laid back dog getting first hyper then lethargic i took him to the vet and they saw that his liver and kidneys were being compromised in his lab work that is when i started looking into everything he was eating and noticed that these are made in china i did not check for this initially because i purchased them at whole foods and wf has guidelines before a food can get on the shelves i am concerned that while these treats may not have caused death they are having an adverse effect on some pets three weeks after i took him off these this food his lab values returned to normal i noticed several other reviews here from pet owners with similar issues to mine i am giving them star because there is no button for stars 
negative,29/1/21,okay a lot of chicken breast treats from china are causing dogs to be sick see the fda website for details this is not one of them but when i started buying it it was made in the usa now it is made in china although my dogs have long loved this treat i am in the process of searching for a replacement made in a safe country 
negative,17/4/21,i have been feeding these to our dog for years to help her with her joints especially her hips ever since i started her on these as a treat meaning i gave her one in the morning and another in the evening she regained her active self and they helped her get interested in her regular meals it was a win win situation for our finicky eater however i would like to note that when i started her on these treats they were being made in the usa resentfully i discovered that they are now produced in china as we know china produces some very high end products and some real crap as well however when it comes to food products that come from overseas a warning flag goes up in my mind especially if they are coming from china personally i never noticed anything odd with our year old dog s reaction to happy hips still i decided that i did not want to subject her to a food product coming out of china does anyone know of another product like happy hips with glucosamine for the joints in it that is produced in the usa 
negative,10/3/21,plenty of articles have been written about the danger and disease s caused by chinese made dog treats these treats are made in china plenty of healthy usa made treats available avoid these at all costs after the latest information was released i tried to return to amazon but they said no please do not buy these treats 
negative,30/5/21,my dog became very ill vomiting diarrhea excruciating pain in mid oct and spent three days at the emergency vet and cost us they ruled out a bunch of things and were only able to say that he might have irritable bowel disease but the biopsy to find out for certain would cost us an additional he did recover without the test and came home and is on a special gastrointestinal diet now however i have to say that i had a large bag of these in my cupboard when he became ill and used them regularly as the treat of choice to get him in his crate i cannot say for sure that these were the because but i will not be buying any dog food products treats or otherwise that are made in china treats made in the usa only for us 
negative,28/9/21,i ordered three packages because the price was so good then i saw this i am asking amazon for a refund otherwise they are going in the trash unused copied from fda web site fda continues to caution dog owners about chicken jerky products november the food and drug administration fda is again cautioning consumers that chicken jerky products for dogs also sold as chicken tenders strips or treats may be associated with illness in dogs in the last months fda has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from china these complaints have been reported to fda by dog owners and veterinarians fda issued a cautionary warning regarding chicken jerky products to consumers in september and a preliminary animal health notification in december of after seeing the number of complaints received drop off during the latter part of and most of the fda is once again seeing the number of complaints rise to the levels of concern that prompted release of our earlier warnings chicken jerky products should not be substituted for a balanced diet and are intended to be fed occasionally in small quantities fda is advising consumers who choose to feed their dogs chicken jerky products to watch their dogs closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products decreased appetite decreased activity vomiting diarrhea sometimes with blood increased water consumption and or increased urination if the dog shows any of these signs stop feeding the chicken jerky product owners should consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than hours blood tests may indicate kidney failure increased urea nitrogen and creatinine urine tests may indicate fanconi syndrome increased glucose although most dogs appear to recover some reports to the fda have involved dogs that have died fda in addition to several animal health diagnostic laboratories in the you s is working to determine why these products are associated with illness in dogs fda s veterinary laboratory response network vlrn is now available to support these animal health diagnostic laboratories to date scientists have not been able to determine a definitive because for the reported illnesses fda continues extensive chemical and microbial testing but has not identified a contaminant the fda continues to actively investigate the problem and its origin many of the illnesses reported may be the result of causes other than eating chicken jerky veterinarians and consumers alike should report cases of animal illness associated with pet foods to the fda consumer complaint coordinator in their state or go to 
negative,6/5/21,just a word of warning this product is made in china where they may add a substance that can because serious kidney problems in dogs read the blog on the topic of chicken dog treats made in china after reading the many comments posted by dog owners who fed they dogs chicken treats made in china i am discarding all of these treats and will seek an alternative product that is made in the usa 
negative,20/4/21,fda just issued yet another warning for dog chicken jerky treats made in china dog lovers you need to pay attention we just threw our stuff in the trash yet another health article appeared on cnn online re dog chicken jerky treats i re read the reviews on amazon i contacted dogswell customer service and got a lengthy very informative reply that said a large number of our products are sourced and manufactured in the united states and only a small number of our treats are made in china my package clearly states made in china so did i buy that small number of bags i carefully weighed all the information and still do not feel comfortable i believe the manufacturer cares a lot about dogs but how about keeping the business right here in the usa we just made the decision to stop ordering this product yes my dogs like the treats but i cannot in my heart say i can serve them to my pups i am unconvinced that this is the best option for my dogs 
negative,20/4/21,i do not trust dog treats made in china as an alternative there is a good chicken jerky dog treat made by goodness gracious in the usa and using human grade chicken 
negative,21/4/21,i have been giving these chews to my mini pincher and mini dauchand for the past years to help support their joints and hips the last batch i bought is darker in color to the point of almost being burnt and smells a lot more it made my mini pincher sick to the point of vomiting and liquid stools i am going to shop for a better product that is made here in the us i have been looking at gnc products for dogs and that is probably the route i will take 
negative,2/5/21,i bought these from a large chain pet store after reading the reviews i checked the bag made in china i threw the whole bag away i wish i would have read the reviews first 
negative,18/12/19,good thing i got this from the bargain bin or i would really be perturbed whatever the claims this mix has no chocolate flavor of any kind a more correct description would be coconut flavored drink mix apparently the oz rating is including the weight of the cauldron because there is no way there was oz of product inside you might get three cups of hot chocolate per container if you like the flavor really mild it really was not worth the price i paid and certainly not the inflated regular price two of the three cauldrons were dented heavily so those will not even be much use as decoration look for a better brand 
negative,19/1/20,this is one of my favorite cereals but purchase it only if you do not mind eating it in powder form what you get is mostly powder not crunchy squares i will not be ordering again sorry 
negative,19/1/20,while taste is ok it is simply using too many artificial colors red yellow yellow approved by fda does not mean it is healthy and other chemicals bht etc to be used by children if you are going to eat it yourself take your chances but since there are many good and healthy alternatives why bother 
negative,31/3/20,i was disappointed to receive earth s best organic snakin fruit rings banana because it hurt my child when she bit into the hard and stale treat 
negative,18/12/19,we ordered the product and received broken bottles but amazon is excellent and reshipped the entire order again one day shipping unfortunately even at cents a bottle we overpaid there is no cheese taste and it is really just a salty mess now we have bottles of a below average product save your money 
negative,13/10/19,absolutely no cheese flavor at all all you can taste is salt salt salt save your money and try something else 
negative,28/9/20,if you like cheese seasoning on your popcorn this product will not deliver it tastes like they should instead of putting anything cheese related on the label they should say improved salt flavoring that will stick to popcorn more than salt i would recommend anything by kernal season s brand that tastes like cheese but if you like a salty tasting popcorn this is the seasoning for you 
negative,16/11/20,i bought this at a local albertsons recently and it is not at all as advertised there is no cheesy flavor detectable in the product even the salt flavor is off avoid this product 
negative,27/2/20,reese changed their cheesy popcorn seasoning it is more salt than cheese in fact it has very little cheese flavor left i will not be purchasing this product again 
negative,26/2/21,this is an okay gift box only if you like mediocre cheese and summer sausage the items are small smaller than they appear in the picture i only paid but i would not purchase it again on the positive side the mustard samples that come with it make the items edible 
negative,18/12/19,it looks llike i just walked into a raw deal the item is intolerably stale and there is no recourse i am simply stuck with it i love licorice and have bought gustaf s licorice on amazon before to much enjoyment what i received here is a junky plastic bag unsuitable to preserve the product containing product that clearly is too old and has not been kept under proper storage conditions add to that labeling is generic and apparently this item contains wheat in substantial quantities not what i know from my brand name gustaf s licorice packages those disclaimers on the item descriptions regarding ingredients may differ are utterly pointless and plain not ok how does that do anything other than cover the vendor s rear clearly customers get no choice and might wind up with expensive purchases of allergy triggers strike one utterly stale strike two not returnable strike three no declaration of ingredients pre purchase only offensive legal see ya just about every packaged food or supplement i can purchase in a store falls under clear fda guidelines for labeling food safety storage conditions materials expiration date those rules are growing on me i am a strong buyer and i shall refrain from any such purchases moving forward not only is it too risky and pricey if duped with degraded product it is also an inexcusable trap who wants to get stuck with waste and have their money taken amazon is not what i would remembered it to be 
negative,19/1/20,thank god that i tasted the metal before i swallowed them i do not even get how it got mixed up with this the candy itself is sex in mouth 
negative,13/9/20,this product was very good when i began buying it but lately it is terrible there is no taste at all that is the reason i no longer purchase this item thank you 
negative,10/7/20,once again paragon has disappointed with this flavor the hawaiian tropic simply did not carry much flavor and what you could taste was not pleasant at all i do not recommend this syrup concentrate
